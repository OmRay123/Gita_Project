 #### Bengali Translation 

Your enemies will ridicule your capabilities and say so many unspeakable things. What can be a greater suffering than this?

 #### Commentary 

The maleficent ones – meaning: “shatru” [enemies] — Begin Footnote. — “Shatru” [enemy] – see the commentary of the 8th sloka of Chapter 2 [of the Gita].  — End Footnote. — (deceivers and the senses) – will ridicule your capabilities. They will say all sorts of unspeakable and malevolent things – meaning: you yourself will be greatly ridiculing yourself and being filled with self-contempt, automatically. What can be a greater suffering than this?! “Dhik jeevitaṃ vyarthamanorathasya” - meaning: one who fails at his/her objective, that person's life is contemptuous.
