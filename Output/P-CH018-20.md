सर्वभूतेषु येनैकं भावमव्ययमीक्षते |

sarva-bhūteṣhu yenaikaṁ bhāvam avyayam īkṣhate
avibhaktaṁ vibhakteṣhu taj jñānaṁ viddhi sāttvikam

 #### Bengali Translation 

That [knowledge] by which one sees One Non-diminishing, Indivisible Essence in all things, know that that knowledge is sattvic.

 #### Commentary 

All of these – from Maya to the end of inert matter – space, air, fire, water, earth, [and the] moisture-born, egg-born, seed-born [and] womb-born creatures that you are seeing as separate – all of these are destructible. That which is destructible – that is that which is impermanent. That in which all of these end – that is that which is Eternal and Non-diminishing. Thus, this separateness – these [manifestations] are showing as different only because of the differences of names and forms. Actually, there is no other [nothing else] besides the One. When this knowledge dawns – know that that is when it is sattvic [knowledge].
