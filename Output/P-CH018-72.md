 #### Bengali Translation 

O Partha [Arjuna]! Have you listened to this with a concentrated mind? O Dhananjaya [Arjuna]! Has your delusion born of ignorance been destroyed?

 #### Commentary 

Now, the sadhak [yogi] is asking oneself by oneself – O Partha [the sadhak]! The way that you were, believing, because of being in the stupor of Maya, that you are bound – has that sin of Maya been removed by hearing this teaching-enquiry with one-pointed mind? Have you [Dhananjaya – the vanquisher of possessions], conquered the six possessions (birth, death, pleasure, pain, hunger, thirst) of the jiva? Has your web of illusion born of ignorance been destroyed?
