प्रयाता यान्ति तं कालं वक्ष्यामि भरतर्षभ || 23||
yatra kāle tvanāvṛittim āvṛittiṁ chaiva yoginaḥ
prayātā yānti taṁ kālaṁ vakṣhyāmi bharatarṣhabha

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Bharatarshabha [Arjuna]! The [particular] “kaal” [ordinary meaning: time; death; see commentary below for spiritual meaning] when yogis leave their bodies and do not return, and the [particular] “kaal” of leaving the body that causes one to return – I am telling you now about the matters of those “kaals.”

 #### Commentary 

To expel or relinquish breath is called “kaal” (death). Its teaching has been previously given (Chapter 8, sloka 6 [of the Gita]). Now, the last breath via which one has “anavritti” [non-return] – meaning: Emancipation, and [the last breath via which one has] “punaravritti” [return] – meaning: rebirth – that teaching [about those] is now being given. The yogis can determine, and, according to their own wishes, can either take or not take either of these two. [Sri Krishna says,] “I am speaking about that [particular] relinquishing of that final breath.”
