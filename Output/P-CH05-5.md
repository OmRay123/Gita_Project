#### Prose 

यत्साङ्ख्यै: प्राप्यते स्थानं तद्योगैरपि गम्यते |
एकं साङ्ख्यं च योगं च य: पश्यति स पश्यति || 5||
yat sānkhyaiḥ prāpyate sthānaṁ tad yogair api gamyate
ekaṁ sānkhyaṁ cha yogaṁ cha yaḥ paśhyati sa paśhyati

 #### Bengali Translation 

The abode that is attained by the sannyasis who are established in gyana – the karmayogis [practitioners of spiritual yoga] attain that very abode as well. Thus, the one who sees sankhya and yoga as the same – it is that person who is a true seer.

 #### Commentary 

The Kriya of the six chakras is yoga; and the Kriya of the Sahasrar is sankhya. The culmination of both is the same (see the previous sloka [5:4]). The one brahmanadi within the sushumna goes from the Muladhar to the brahmarandhra in the Sahasrar. If one enters wholly into this brahmanadi, the differences in chakras no longer remain. All become one. One who sees this Oneness (directly experiences it) – it is that person who truly sees. That being is the Seer who is the Witness – meaning: it is that person who is the Knower of Brahman.
