ajñānaṁ chābhijātasya pārtha sampadam āsurīm

 #### Bengali Translation 

Hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, cruelty and lack of discrimination – these are the endowments of those born in the direction of the “asuras” [the demonic]. 

 #### Commentary 

“Dambha” [hypocrisy] – showing religiosity because of the hankering to have respect, or deceiving others with the performance of dutiful acts. “Darpa” – showing arrogance. “Abhimaan” [vanity] – for the littlest of reasons, showing extreme sadness, envy, being unfeeling or feeling offended – [being like this] in regards to wealth, education, lineage, relations etc. When desire is unfulfilled, the tendency that rises in the inner being – that is that which is called “krodha” [anger]. “Parushya” – rudeness (harshness). However something is, perceiving that as the opposite is called “ajnanata” [being ignorant]. O Arjuna! These are the endowments of those who are born in the direction of “asuras” [those of demonic nature].
