 #### Bengali Translation 

O Lotus Eyed One [Sri Krishna]! From You, I have now heard extensively about the creation and dissolution of phenomena; I have heard now about other Glories as well.

 #### Commentary 

O Lotus Eyed One! When one looks at the back of a lotus leaf – the part that faces the water – one can see eye-like forms in every area; this is happening due to the veins of the leaf. Similarly, You are there in the Form of the Seer within every atom and particle. There is nothing anywhere that is hidden from Your Sight. The “bhava” – meaning: the matters of emergence, and “apyaya” – meaning: the matters of dissolution of all phenomena, as well as the matters of the Inexhaustible Glories of “I” – from You (meaning: when I was in the “I” State – from that State) I have heard [about these] extensively. I have seen. I have understood.
