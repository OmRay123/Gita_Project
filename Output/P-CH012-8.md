#### Prose 

मय्येव मन आधत्स्व मयि बुद्धिं निवेशय |
निवसिष्यसि मय्येव अत ऊर्ध्वं न संशय: || 8||
mayy eva mana ādhatsva mayi buddhiṁ niveśhaya
nivasiṣhyasi mayy eva ata ūrdhvaṁ na sanśhayaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

Still the mind in Me. Submerge the intellect in Me. If that is done, then you will reside up above in Me. There is no doubt about this.

 #### Commentary 

Therefore, throw the mind solely into “I”; submit the intellect solely into “I”. If that is done, then, without any doubt, the Mayamutations will not be able to touch you. You will be elevated – meaning: during the time that you have to still carry a body, during that whole time you will always remain in Self-abidance in the State of the Self (be jivanmukta [Liberated while still living in the body]) above the Ajnachakra. And you will never again have to come down and be bound in the path of Prakriti. And after the body falls [physical death happens], you will most certainly become that True “I”.
