 #### Bengali Translation 

O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! All of the forms that take birth in all of the wombs – “Mahadbrahma” is their womb, and I am their seed-issuing Father.

 #### Commentary 

O Arjuna! All of the kinds of wombs that there are – gods, demons, animals, birds etc. – and all of the kinds of forms that come forth from them – the womb of all of that is that “Mahadbrahma,” and that “Aham” (“I”) is the seed-giving Father.
