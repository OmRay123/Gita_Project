 #### Bengali Translation 

Having put mind and life on Me (those “budh[s]” [knowledgeable ones; see commentary to sloka 10:8 above for spiritual explanation]), teach each other about the matters of “I”, and conversing always about the matters of “I”, attain contentment and happiness.

 #### Commentary 

At the time of dissolution, “mind-ness” does not remain in Maya; it enters into “I”. And therefore, the life-force that is usually connected to life in the world – that too, along with “mind-ness,” enters into “I”. This is because at that time Maya has no power of action. For this reason, the duality of the “other” comes to an end. If there is anyone there to say anything at that time, and if that being says anything – in that case, because that being is Alone, that being will say, “I AM ‘I’.” This “I” is, verily, the Eternal. All that is to be had has been had (because everything has merged into “I”), and because of this, there is no wanting for attaining or having. Joy is Itself enjoying Joy. Purush and Prakriti becoming one is that which is called “raman” [Divine Romance; Divine Delight]. And that is what is happening here.
