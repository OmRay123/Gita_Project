 #### Commentary 

Previously, the Lord has said that human beings attain perfection if they worship God. How that work that is one’s own is to be carried out, and what kind of perfection will be attained – in order to teach that, He is saying that one should perform all actions with an unattached mind at all times/everywhere. One should worship with a vanquished ego and without desire. If that happens, then the supreme non-doing perfection – meaning: one will attain the purification of one’s essence in the form of the relinquishing of the fruits of actions – meaning: the one whose intellect does not conclude that children and home and such make up the essence of life, [the one for whom] through special Kriya, the mind, intellect and chitta [personal consciousness] is under one’s control, the one who has no rising up of any kind of desire from having affection towards enjoyment – that is the one who, through sannyas (the destruction of “sarva” [ordinary meaning: “all”; meaning in the Pranab Gita: the whole of the worldly experience]), attains the supreme non-doing perfection (the Settledness in Brahman) (see Chapter 3, sloka 4).
