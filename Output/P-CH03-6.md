 #### Bengali Translation 

The person who, after controlling the senses, goes on thinking about the matters of the world – that person is known as a “mudhatma” [stupid being] and a “kapatachari” [hypocrite].

 #### Commentary 

The person who acts like a renunciate without having crossed the field of actions through performance of the [spiritual] act – even if that person has controlled the organs of action, because of being tied to the gunas of Prakriti, that person's mind has to go to the matters of the world. Then, in order to show people one's “renunciated-ness,” one keeps the organs of action from working. This kind of victory over the sense-organs can only get one the pleasure of “loka-ananda” [joy from people's approval]; one cannot get “Brahmananda” [the Bliss of Brahman]. “Stupid”: because – although the force of being caught up in the worldly experience is taking over the mind, it is only to keep the asserted reputation [of holiness] intact that this person controls the sense-organs. That is why this person is a “mithyachari” [cultivator of the false]. Footnote - Just by being a sadhak, one knows this: one has been sitting in the correct posture during Kriya; Kriya is going on; while continuing, such a thought about worldly matters rises up in the mind that one perhaps ends Kriya for that day due to that thought. This is also a state of “mithyachar” [cultivation of the false]. When this condition comes about, one must go on doing Kriya with steady persistence, following the teaching “tatastato niyamyaitadAtmanyeva vashaṃ nayet” [rein in [the mind] from that [worldly thought] and let it be under the control of the Self]; one can then become released [from being bound]. End Footnote.
