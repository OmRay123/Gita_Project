सर्वभूतानि सम्मोहं सर्गे यान्ति परन्तप || 27||
ichchhā-dveṣha-samutthena dvandva-mohena bhārata
sarva-bhūtāni sammohaṁ sarge yānti parantapa

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Bharat [Arjuna]! O Parantapa [Arjuna]! Right at the birth of the physical body do all living beings become filled with delusion, which is created by doubt and wrong perception, which are born of desire and aversion. 

 #### Commentary 

When does the jiva [individual being] succumb to the power of Yoga-Maya and become blind with ignorance? Taking this question at hand, its answer is given in this sloka. It is being said that the jiva becomes a slave to Yoga-Maya just by being born. Just when the “sarga” - meaning: the physical body – of the jiva is taken on, right then, desire and aversion gather up in the mind – meaning: there is the coming about of the desire to have comfort for the body and the aversion to discomfort. As soon as desire and aversion come about, there is the rising up of doubt and misperception – meaning: believing that comfort is happiness, the jiva remains in wellness (remains quiet) [when there is comfort], and believing that discomfort is unhappiness, the jiva cries [when there is discomfort]. In this way, the jiva becomes controlled by the delusion-filled dual states of pleasure and pain. Being like this, it forgets the Self (the “I”), and remains captivated by the waves of samsara.
