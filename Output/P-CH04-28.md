 #### Bengali Translation 

Other faithfully pious “yati[s]” [sages] perform the “dravya-yagya” [yagya of things], “tapoyagya” [yagya of austerities], yoga-yagya [yagya of yoga] and “svadhyayagya” [yagya of scriptural knowledge].

 #### Commentary 

Those who practice the guru-instructed Kriya-method with care – they are the ones who are “yati[s]” [sages]. The yatis, for whom obstacles never come about – whether in terms of place, time or participant – against the regular carrying out of their regular, correct performance of karmas [spiritual acts] such as worship, repentance and such, and those for whom – at the specific times for specific karmas to be done according to the rules – there is no other karma [act] to be carried out – it is they who are the yatis of “saṃshita-vrata” [observers of vows]. During Kriya, these sages perform sequentially: “dravya-yagya,” “tapoyagya,” “yogayagya” and “svadhyAyagyanayagya.” [See next paragraphs for spiritual definitions of the aforementioned yagyas and their explanations.] The offering of “dravyas” [things] in a sanctified place is called “dravya-yagya.” Earth, water, fire, air, space, direction, self, time, mind – these are the nine types of “dravya.” The six places such as the Muladhar etc. are the sanctified places. At first, while being in the power of time, the drawing-up of and the offering of the vital-air to each chakra – adjoined with mantra being uttered mentally – that is done; and later, when the essence of all dravyas, the Nectar falling from the Sahasrar, is offered as oblation into the vaishvanara [fire in the navel region] – that is called “dravya-yagya.” Upon the completion of dravya-yagya, the sadhak rises above the five principal elements to Tapoloka at the Agya-chakra, and, by defeating the Mayic attraction, destroys the restlessness of the chitta. This is “tapoyagya.” Then, after the tendency of the chitta to be thrown-off is destroyed by tapoyagya, the sadhak witnesses only the True Form of one's own Self in a steady and serene state. At that time, there is only the duality of the seen and the seer. Everything else gets left behind. This is that which is called “yogayagya.” In this state, when at first Pranava [is heard], and then from It – the mother of the Vedas – Gayatri [is heard], and finally, as the Rig and such Vedas go on being recited spontaneously through bodiless voices – that is what is called “svadhyaya-yagya.” (“Svadhyaya” - “su” = “sundar” [beautiful] – meaning: one's True Form + “a” = Prakriti – meaning: “sadhak” + “adhyaya” = “alochana” [revelation].) This is because: the “tvaṃ”-sadhak, and the “tat”-God – it is in the state of the seeing of each other as the True Form in front of each other that this [“svadhyaya” - revelation] comes forth. By going on listening to the Sound of Pranava – like an unbroken flow of oil – within that “svadhyaya,” as the one becomes intoxicated and loses oneself [in Divine Bliss], the “svadhyayagya” is completed. At the end of this completion, after the samadhi state breaks, and one opens one's attention, all that is knowable in the three sections of time from the beginning to the end are all known. The Vision of Brahman in everything and everywhere is established. This is that which is “gyanayagya.”22
