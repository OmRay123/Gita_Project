#### Prose 

न द्वेष्ट्यकुशलं कर्म कुशले नानुषज्जते |
त्यागी सत्त्वसमाविष्टो मेधावी छिन्नसंशय: || 10||
na dveṣhṭy akuśhalaṁ karma kuśhale nānuṣhajjate
tyāgī sattva-samāviṣhṭo medhāvī chhinna-sanśhayaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

The tyagi [one who has cast off attachments], because of being filled with goodness, being of steady intellect and being free of doubt, does not hate actions that cause sorrow and does not have dearness for actions that cause pleasure. 

 #### Commentary 

The word “satbhaava” [living in goodness] is called “sattva” – meaning: that which brings forth truth, justice, mercy, devotion, magnanimity, purity etc. – meaning: the Self. One who is established in the Self, one who, abiding in the Self as oneself, does not take in anything extra to the Self into the antahkarana – that one is called “sattvasamavishta” [abiding in goodness]. The one who has become certain that the Self Itself is Forever, and that everything extra to That is impermanent, and therefore has abandoned everything that is impermanent – that is the one who is called “tyagi.” The intelligent one with the strength of remembrance – meaning: I Am Brahman and nothing else – the one in whom this remembrance does not waver – that is the one who is called “medhaavi” [intelligent]. The sadhaks [aspirants] who are in these states do not at all have any doubts in them. That is why they do not hate actions that are not beneficent, and they do not become fond of actions that are beneficent.
