 #### Bengali Translation 

That which is of a type like: being poison-like in the beginning but changing into the nectarous/immortal blessing of Self-Knowledge – [happiness] that is born of this – that is sattvic happiness.

 #### Commentary 

Not finding one descriptive term that speaks of the state of sattvic happiness, the Lord says: that which is “tat” [that] – meaning: of that type, the type that the partaking enjoyers have known by enjoying; it has be known by enjoying it by oneself; it is not to be spoken about and stated; that which is poison-like in the beginning – because one has to go through a great deal of struggle when practicing knowledge, detachment, meditation, samadhi etc; but that which changes into evident Immortality – that is because the Blissful Glory that is had after the cultivation of knowledge, detachment etc. – that has no boundaries, no end, no diminishing – It is Infinite – Immortal. And that which is born of the blessedness of Self-Knowledge – meaning: later, the mind, [abiding] in the Self, becomes free of the contact with rajas and tamas [gunas], and rises as pure and clear – the happiness that is like this – this is the happiness that is called sattvic happiness.
