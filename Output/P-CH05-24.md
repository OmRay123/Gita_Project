 #### Bengali Translation 

The one whose happiness is in the Self alone, whose comfort is in the Self alone, and who sees only the Self – meaning: the one who does not take anyone other than the Self in the antahkarana [inner consciousness] – that yogi becomes established in Brahman and attains “Brahman-Nirvana” (“Kaivalya Mukti” [Emancipation]).

 #### Commentary 

It is not enough to just bear the force of desire and anger. The one who, via the inner perception, witnesses the True Form of Consciousness upon having entered Kutastha, and thereby experiences happiness – meaning: becomes joyful – later, upon becoming devoid of fickleness, that sadhak receives comfort – meaning: becomes Still. And, with the aid of the Light of Consciousness, that sadhak cuts through whatever is seen via the subtle sight. That sadhak's intellect becomes subtle, extremely subtle, and even more subtle than that and merges into the Infinite. Everything becomes extinguished. The sadhak, as well, merges into Brahman and becomes Brahman. This is the attainment of “Brahman-Nirvana” by the yogi.
