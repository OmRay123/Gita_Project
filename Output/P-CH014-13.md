#### Prose 

अप्रकाशोऽप्रवृत्तिश्च प्रमादो मोह एव च |
तमस्येतानि जायन्ते विवृद्धे कुरुनन्दन || 13||
aprakāśho ’pravṛittiśh cha pramādo moha eva cha
tamasy etāni jāyante vivṛiddhe kuru-nandana

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Kurunandan [beloved child of the Kurus; Arjuna]! “Aprakash” [non-revealing], “apravritti” [non-endeavoring], “pramaad” [madness] and “moha” [delusion] – when all of these aspects are born – that is when tamoguna has spread. 

 #### Commentary 

The capability and strength to do work are fully there, but how to do that [work] – there is no light at all to know that. This type of dull/unintelligent state is called “aprakash” [non-revealing].
 
If I want, I can do everything/anything, but there is no attempting to do so. This kind of heaviness in the mental state is called “apravritti” [non-endeavoring].
 
Not looking at the good, and running towards doing only bad things is called “pramaad” [madness].
 
Being intoxicated and staying in a stupor is called “moha” [delusion; being stupefied]. O delight of the lineage of Kurus [Arjuna]! When all of these states rise up and manifest themselves in the antahkarana, know that, at that time, you have been surrounded by the mutations of tamas.
