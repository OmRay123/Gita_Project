#### Prose 

नैते सृती पार्थ जानन्योगी मुह्यति कश्चन |
तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु योगयुक्तो भवार्जुन || 27||
naite sṛitī pārtha jānan yogī muhyati kaśhchana
tasmāt sarveṣhu kāleṣhu yoga-yukto bhavārjuna

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Partha [Arjuna]! If these two paths are known, then no yogi becomes deluded. Therefore, O Arjuna! Become engaged in yoga at all times.

 #### Commentary 

These paths of brightness and darkness are only mastered by yogis through practice. In case the yogi is unable to take the bright path, in case, due to the failing of attention, the yogi ends up taking the dark path, even if that happens, even after taking birth again, due to the memory of previous advancements in the previous life, or due to having done very high works, the yogi does not get deluded by Maya and the illusory net. What need do you have for relying on memories of  advancements in a past life, dear friend? Just sit there and keep your attention on the bright path with every single breath.
