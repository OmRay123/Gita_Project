 #### Bengali Translation 

One who speaks this supreme secret scripture of the [Bhagavad] Gita to My devotees – that one, having supreme devotion to Me and being free of doubts, will attain Me, verily. 

 #### Commentary 

The one who teaches this scripture of the [Bhagavad] Gita – which is spoken in the guise of a dialogue between Guru and disciple – to a devotee of “I” – meaning: to one who longs to become “I” – as that teacher is making the devotion of that [listener] devotee firm in “I” – that one [the teacher] too, through the power of that practice [of teaching] and sadhana [one’s own practice], at the time of relinquishing the final breath of the body, will fall into “I” and become “I”. There is no doubt about this.
