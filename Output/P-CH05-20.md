 #### Bengali Translation 

The one who is the knower of Brahman – that one is of steady intellect, free of delusion, [and] remains verily in Brahman. For this reason, that person does not become joyous upon receiving a dear thing, nor does he/she become upset by having something unpleasant happen.

 #### Commentary 

[The one who abides in Brahman-ness – what are the signs of that person – that is what is being spoken about in this sloka.] Ordinary people, and those who have not become perfected through sadhana – all of the things that those people feel as beneficent or maleficent – the knower of Brahman does not become joyous or sorrowful when those things come about at the time of “prarabdhabhoga” [fulfillment of prarabdha karma]. — Begin Footnote. — All that has to be done while living in the world – going on doing that without any agenda is called “prarabdhabhoga” [the fulfillment of prarabdha karma]. — End Footnote. — That sadhak's intellect remains in Brahman, unmoving and unshakeable. Thus, that sadhak is free of delusion. That being is “agAdha buddhirakshuddhah” [with intellect in fathomless serenity].
