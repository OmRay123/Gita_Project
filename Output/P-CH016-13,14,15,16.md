 #### Bengali Translation 

Today I have got this desired thing; (later) I will [again] get this (desired thing). I have this wealth, and again I will have this wealth. These enemies are killed by me. I will kill other enemies too. I am God. I am the enjoyer. I am perfected, powerful and happy. I have possessions such as wealth etc. and I am of high-birth. Who else is there like me? I will perform fire rites. I will give charity. I will have joy. Being deluded in ignorance like this, having their minds engaged in all kinds of matters, (all of those asuric people) become covered by the web of distorted delusion and addicted to the enjoyments of lusts, and thereby fall to malefic hells.

 #### Commentary 

Today I got this; with this, I will fulfill such and such desire. I have this, and I will surely get this in the future. And then I will be known as wealthy. I have killed such and such enemies, and I will also kill so and so! I am God. I am the enjoyer. I am a perfected being. I am powerful. I am happy. Wealthy am I. Knowledgeable am I. Who else is there comparable to me? I can spend so much money in rites, fire ceremonies and pilgrimages! [The asuras] are deluded in this kind of ignorance. And they are covered by many other kinds of distortions of mind (having fallen into anxiety and such). And so, being addicted to the enjoyments of lustful indulgences that never become one’s own, thinking that they are one’s own and bowing to them in madness, [the asuras] remain engrossed in those kinds of thoughts, and due to being heavily habituated to that, the tendencies of lust arise at the time of death (“yA matih sA gathirbhavet” [as one thinks, so is one’s destiny]), and thereby [the asuras] fall (take birth) in malefic hells (in the wombs of those inclined to eating, sleeping, having sex and being afraid). All of these things are the play of the lower levels of mind, experiencing the samsara-hell.
