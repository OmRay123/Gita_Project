 #### Bengali Translation 

Obtaining respect for oneself [from others], not being gentle, and being proud and arrogant, they [the asuric natured], filled with hypocrisy, perform rites by name only and not according to injunctions. 

 #### Commentary 

All of these asura people think, “No one has ever been born like me – I who am endowed with all great qualities.” They, filled with haughtiness of wealth and pride, do not believe in gurus; they do not want to bow to anyone. They conduct rites, but they do it to show people and buy reputation; they do not do so with faith/reverence. Bound by egotism, their rites are not performed according to injunctions. The prescribed sattvic-ness [peaceful purity] that is part of rites – they destroy that. They become doers of rites that are futile, and by name only.
