इहैकस्थं जगत्कृत्स्नं पश्याद्य सचराचरम् |
मम देहे गुडाकेश यच्चान्यद्द्रष्टुमिच्छसि || 7||
ihaika-sthaṁ jagat kṛitsnaṁ paśhyādya sa-charācharam
mama dehe guḍākeśha yach chānyad draṣhṭum ichchhasi

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Gudakesh [Arjuna]! Now [behold] the entire creation, the moving and the unmoving, within this Body of Mine, and whatever else you wish to see. All of that is existing together in just a part of My Body.

 #### Commentary 

O Gudakesh! (“Gudaka” = sleep; “eesh” = ruler [one who has conquered sleep]; see Chapter 9, sloka 23 [of the Gita].) — Begin Translator’s Note — There is a possibility that the reference to Chapter 9, sloka 23 is a misprint. The translators have maintained the literal nature of this English translation and have kept the information in the parenthetical as it is. It is possible that the reference is meant to be the commentary to Chapter 1, slokas 24-25 of the Pranab Gita — End Translator’s Note. — This creation of the “sacharachar” [with the attributes of motion and inertia] (“char” = that which is moving about, the moving living beings; and “achar” = fixed; that which cannot move about – like trees, stones etc.) – behold how all of these are in one place in My Body. And see the dramascript of past-future-present (the victory, defeat and conflict occurring during your sadhana). Whatever you wish to see – see that itself.
