 #### Bengali Translation 

Because that sadhak, having abandoned all attachment to the fruits of karmas, is fully satisfied in the Bliss of the Self and free of all reliance, that sadhak has nothing else to hold [no need to take recourse in anything else].

 #### Commentary 

The one who is “pandit” [see commentary to the previous sloka – 4:19] – because that person's desire for the fruits of karmas have been cast off, he/she remains fully satisfied in the Bliss of the Self. That sadhak has no other thing in which to take recourse [no need to take recourse in anything else]. Thus, even if one is engaged in the karmas [actions] of “shariayatrArtha” [for the sake of the maintenance of the body] or “lokasaṃgrArtha” [societal reasons], because there is the state of “yatra yatra mano yAti tatraiva brahma lakshyate” [wherever the mind goes, it sees Brahman], that sadhak only abides in the One Self [and nothing else]. That is why, even if that sadhak goes on doing karma [actions of the types mentioned in the previous sentence], he/she experiences akarma.
