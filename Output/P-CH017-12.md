#### Prose 

अभिसन्धाय तु फलं दम्भार्थमपि चैव यत् |
इज्यते भरतश्रेष्ठ तं यज्ञं विद्धि राजसम् || 12||
abhisandhāya tu phalaṁ dambhārtham api chaiva yat
ijyate bharata-śhreṣhṭha taṁ yajñaṁ viddhi rājasam

 #### Bengali Translation 

O greatest of the Bharatas [Arjuna]! But the yajna [rite] that is performed with the intention to produce results and to propagate one’s own greatness – know that yajna to be rajasic.

 #### Commentary 

O greatest of the lineage of the Bharatas [Arjuna; the sadhak]! The yajna [rite] that is performed with the attention on results, and with ostentatiousness – that is called “rajasic yajna.” It is like: all of the brahmins are waiting for me at an invitation/feast (I am senior). The day is coming to an end [sunset, a time of devotions, has arrived]. But while showing people that I really do a lot of worshipping, I shut the door to the worship room and sit inside the room cleaning the nails of my feet – doing this kind of thing.
