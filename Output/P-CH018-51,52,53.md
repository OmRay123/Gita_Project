 #### Bengali Translation 

With purified (sattvic) intellect, stilling that intellect with steadfastness, abandoning all worldly experiences such as sound etc., relinquishing affection and repulsion (related to such worldly experiences), and then being solitary in dwelling, eating moderately, having controlled speech, body and mind, and constantly being devoted to the yoga of meditation, and thereafter taking full recourse in detachment, and thus fully relinquishing egotism, forcefulness, arrogance, lust, anger and possession, and being unselfish – the person attains supreme peace and is fit to become Brahman ([fit to] immovably be established in the Knowledge “I Am Brahman”).

 #### Commentary 

The one whose intellect has been purified – meaning: ignores all except for the Self Itself and does not take anything else on; the one whose steadfastness is not on anything else except one’s Self; the one for whom the body-vanity/body-identification is controlled (under his/her power) – meaning: even if distracted, the memory of “body is ‘I’” does not arise; the one in whom the worldly experiences such as sound etc. only operate to just carry on the sustenance of the body – they do not do anything else beyond that; “raga” = affection; “dvesha” = non-affection/repulsion – the one from whom these have completely left; the one who always experiences solitude of empty places, banks of rivers, mountains, cremation grounds in his/her inner being – meaning: rising up from the Muladhar and piercing the Ajna-chakra, that being only moves about in the middle of the brahmanadi – the one who is not enwrapped by the contact with anything whatsoever of the chitra, vajra or sushumna [all nadis [subtle passageways in the body]] ([this is] “living in solitary places”); the one who eats light meals, or the one whose hopes (the desires for having) are light – meaning: does not want anything except Brahman alone; the one whose speech, body and the functionalities of mind are “yata” [controlled] – meaning: [the functionalities of mind] have let go of their own activities; the non-desirous settledness that happens after the ending of thought – meaning: upon merging with Brahman – the thing to be united with – the abidance that is there with attaining that Form – the one who is ever in that (engaged); the one who has no desire for any enjoyment of this world or the next world; and the one who has relinquished [the following]: ego = the vanity of “me-ness”; forcefulness = the power to grasp any Prakritic substance ([in actuality] non-substance); arrogance = the tendency to be “big” by doing a lot of “digging”; lust = thinking in the direction of the worldly experience; anger = the active functionality that arises when the desired thing is taken away [or: cannot be obtained]; possession = to get more than what is necessary – this kind of unselfish (meaning: the one who does not take up anything that can be said to be “mine” – that one), peaceful, steady sadhak is the one who is fit to attain Brahman.
