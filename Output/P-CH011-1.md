 #### Bengali Translation 

Arjuna said: “The Supreme Secret spiritual teaching (discerning the matters of Self and non-self) that You have now bestowed upon me out of your compassion for me – by that [teaching] my delusion has been destroyed.” 

 #### Commentary 

[At the end of the previous chapter [10], the Lord says “I am holding this entire creation by a fragment of Myself.” What is being expressed by that is that He is verily the Form of the Cosmos. With ecstatic mind, Arjuna, desiring to see that Cosmic Form, spoke these [first] four slokas one after the other.] The Supreme Secret teaching which is for the attainment of that Particle of “I”, that which no one can reveal in the outer world, that which is spiritually-adjoined – meaning: is the knowledge of the matters of the Self and the matters of the non-self, that which, can only be spoken about when dressed up as “you,” and cannot be spoken about if one is abiding in “I” (all of these things that I saw/realized in the previous chapters, or heard) – by this [teaching], the delusion of Maya to which I was subject has been dissolved.
