ये मे मतमिदं नित्यमनुतिष्ठन्ति मानवा: |
श्रद्धावन्तोऽनसूयन्तो मुच्यन्ते तेऽपि कर्मभि: || 31||
ye me matam idaṁ nityam anutiṣhṭhanti mānavāḥ
śhraddhāvanto ’nasūyanto muchyante te ’pi karmabhiḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

All of those people, upon being “shraddhavan” [reverent] and “asuavihin” [free of spitefulness], who always practice this teaching of Mine – they are the ones who become free from all karma.

 #### Commentary 

Having faith in the Vedanta spoken by guru, and being engaged in the undisturbed practice of that [teaching] – that is called “shraddha” [reverence]. And not seeing fault in others' qualities is called being “asuavihin” [free of spite or ill thoughts towards others]. Those who do not find any fault with Kriya taught by guru – meaning: not thinking like this: “what is this work that gurudev is making me do; this is nothing” - but instead, having unwavering faith in guru's teaching, engage in the practice of Kriya, and practice Kriya according to the instructions regularly and every day, and do not alter the time of Kriya practice – or not do Kriya, because of some work or because of laziness – they are the ones, verily, who get freedom from the bondage of karma. Others do not get it. (See the next sloka [3:32].)
