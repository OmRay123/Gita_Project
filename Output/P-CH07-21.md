yo yo yāṁ yāṁ tanuṁ bhaktaḥ śhraddhayārchitum ichchhati
tasya tasyāchalāṁ śhraddhāṁ tām eva vidadhāmyaham

 #### Bengali Translation 

Whosoever (of the desirous) worships whichsoever deities with faith and devotion, I give to them [the desirous ones] immovable faith in those very deities.

 #### Commentary 

The Supreme Self is within all beings – gods, humans, etc. – in the form of “I”. Therefore, no matter which god is worshipped, actually the One “I” is being worshipped. But because the perception of otherness is present, the desirous people are not able to see the “I” as Unity, and instead, see things as separate and different. For this reason, the Lord Who is within all (the Supreme Self) Himself bestows the faith in those particular perceptions of otherness. He does not dispel the desirous ones’ perceptions of otherness and bestow the perception of Unity. Thus: whoever worships Him through whichever perception, He satisfies that person in that very way. “Ye yathA mAṃ prapadyante tAmstathaiva bhajAmyaham” [whosoever in whatsoever way surrenders to Me, I reward them in that very way].
