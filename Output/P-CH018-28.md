 #### Bengali Translation 

The doer who is unreasonable (negligent), devoid of discrimination, not gentle, deceitful, causes humiliation to others, is lazy, despondent and dilatory is said to be tamasic.

 #### Commentary 

The one who cannot stay steady on one matter for very long, whose thinking is like a manipulative child, who is stubborn, without gentleness, has “one thing in the stomach and another in the mouth” [one who falsely represents him/herself], one who – for selfish gains – puts dust in the served rice of others [corrupts the needful things of others], who is lazy, indolent, always despondent like the salt boat has sunk [as if all is lost], does not do the work that is to be done today even in ten days’ time – this kind of doer is called a tamasic doer.
