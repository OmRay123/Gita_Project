 #### Bengali Translation 

(If) you become unable to even practice, then engage in “matkarma” [surrender all acts to Me]. If you go on doing all actions dedicated to Me, you will attain perfection. 

 #### Commentary 

If you do not even have the power to practice, then surrender all actions to “I”. How does one surrender all actions? Oh but like this: one has to perform actions directed to “I” – meaning: the “I” which is Brahman. The speech of “I” is Pranava. The source of Pranava is “I”. Going on with that Pranava-utterance in the path as shown by guru, and thereby letting go of all grasping is how actions are dedicated to “I”. And through that very action, through the union of the Atma-mantra and “hangsa,” there will be “siddhi” [attainment] – meaning: one will get the greatest of that which is to be attained – meaning: the fact that you have spontaneously forgotten the Self and have dressed up as “you” – this delusion of being dressed up as “you” will disappear. And that little bit [of surrendered action] will again establish your “I-ness.” See commentary to Chapter 4, sloka 26.
