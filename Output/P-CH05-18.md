#### Prose 

विद्याविनयसम्पन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि |
शुनि चैव श्वपाके च पण्डिता: समदर्शिन: || 18||
vidyā-vinaya-sampanne brāhmaṇe gavi hastini
śhuni chaiva śhva-pāke cha paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśhinaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

Those one's with gyana and with wisdom that is developed see the same [Reality] in a brahmin, a cow, an elephant, in a dog, and even in an outcaste. (They see the One Brahman equally in everyone.)

 #### Commentary 

[Those who attain the destination of no return upon having attained the state of Knowledge – how they go about while living in samsara – that is what is being spoken about in this and the next sloka [4:18-19].] Those for whom the sun-like Knowledge is revealed – because they have the vision of “Brahman everywhere” established in them, they no longer see separation; they no longer have the perception of good and bad; the tension of purity and impurity is no longer there; all becomes One Brahman. The same Brahman that is a brahmin – that same Brahman is also a cow, an elephant, dog and even an outcaste. In their [the gyanis'] eyes, the Truth that “all is Brahman” is directly seen by them.
