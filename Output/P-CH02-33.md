तत: स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि || 33||
atha chet tvam imaṁ dharmyaṁ saṅgrāmaṁ na kariṣhyasi
tataḥ sva-dharmaṁ kīrtiṁ cha hitvā pāpam avāpsyasi

 #### Bengali Translation 

If you do not fight in this dharma-war right now, then you will incur sin because of having abandoned “svadharma” [one's true dharma] and “keerti” [work that is noble and great].

 #### Commentary 

As soon as that state of happiness comes about for the sadhak, he/she sees the Pure Consciousness Sri Krishna Paramatman in front of him/her. And because of the sadhak's Kshatriya-vritti being there, he/she is directly aware of all of the functions of pravritti and nivritti. That is why it is being said, “Being a happy Kshatriya, if you do not fight this Atman-dharma-oriented, pravritti-destroying war (sadhana with pranayam etc.), then abandoning “svadharma” (the settledness in Brahman) and “keerti” (upon making the effort to attain that settledness in Brahman through the performance of spiritual practice, as the “siddhis” [yogic powers] are attained one after the other, the Light of the Self that comes after that – meaning: the Pure Praise and Belief that comes for oneself because of one's own capability – that) will cause you to fall into sin – meaning: the restlessness of Prakriti – the torrent of birth and death.
