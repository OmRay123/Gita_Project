 #### Bengali Translation 

O Gudakesh [Arjuna]! I AM the Self within all things/living beings. I AM the Beginning of all phenomena/living beings – meaning: the Creator, the Middle – meaning: the Sustainer, and the End – meaning: the Destroyer.

 #### Commentary 

“Gudakesh” – “guDAkA” = sleep; “eesha” = deliverance; one who has conquered sleep. The sadhak who cannot be attacked by sleep, the sadhak who is ever awake – that is the one who is “Gudakesh.” “Aham” = “I”, the Self – the Lord of all phenomena and living beings – meaning: the tanmatras [sources of the senses] come from “I”-ness [ego]; space and such elements have come forth from the tanmatras. That is why the “ashay” [abode] or ruler of all phenomena/living beings is called “atma” [self]. “Ashay” means “place.” Wherever one stays, that is that one’s “ashay.” Just as the “ashay” of water is the sea, similarly the “ashay” of phenomena/living beings is “I”. It is from “I” that the phenomena/living beings arise, and again, it is in “I” that phenomena/living beings end. And then again, the middle between this beginning and end is also in “I”. Therefore, the emergence-preservation-destruction of creation is happening on “I”, from “I” and within “I”.
