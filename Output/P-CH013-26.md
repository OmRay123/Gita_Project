 #### Bengali Translation 

However, some others who do not know (how to have realization of the Self, with Its signs as overseer and such, through paths such as samkhya-yoga and such), do worship upon hearing from others (meaning: from the scholars/sages). They too, upon taking refuge in the instructed wisdom, go beyond death. 

 #### Commentary 

There are many persons whose gross nature is greater, and [thus] they have a lesser ability to ascertain subtle matters. They are not able to have realization of the Self Itself through paths such as samkhya-yoga and such. They become engaged in worship upon hearing from others – meaning: from scholars/sages. That teaching received from others is their proven wisdom [for progressing]. They themselves do not have discrimination. But they too, gradually, go beyond the death-enjoined samsara. This is because: with the aid of faith/reverence, and upon going on hearing that teaching, there is the gradual manifestation of devotion, which stops their outward-going tendencies. Then the outer teaching transforms into “Naad” [Divine Sound] within. Continuously listening to that Naad, the mind merges into the Vishnu-Substance.
