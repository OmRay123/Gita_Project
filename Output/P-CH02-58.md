यदा संहरते चायं कूर्मोऽङ्गानीव सर्वश: |
इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता || 58||
yadā sanharate chāyaṁ kūrmo ’ṅgānīva sarvaśhaḥ
indriyāṇīndriyārthebhyas tasya prajñā pratiṣhṭhitā

 #### Bengali Translation 

Just as a tortoise withdraws its head and limbs from the outside into its body, similarly, when the yogi completely gathers in all of the senses from the worldly experience – it is only then that his/her “prajna” [inner awareness] is established. 

 #### Commentary 

Because of being outer-directed, the five senses such as the eyes etc. always experience the matters of the external world. By drawing all of these senses inward from the outer world (like: turning the tongue back, keeping sight above in a still way, aligning the body, head and neck etc.), if one drives their powers [the powers of the senses] in the inner direction through the concentration of mind, there is the experience of extraordinary scent, taste, sight, touch and sound; from these the knowledge of all of the elements is gained. Afterwards, scent goes into taste, taste into sight [etc.] – and like this, all are drawn in and transformed to sound. At that time, the antahkarana [aggregate of the inner operators of personal consciousness] becomes attracted to that sound and unites with the Supreme Self. It is only when this ultimate “drawn-in” state comes about that the “prajna” [inner awareness] is established.
