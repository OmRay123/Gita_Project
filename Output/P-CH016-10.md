 #### Bengali Translation 

(They), having taken recourse in insatiable lust, having become filled with hypocrisy, arrogance and indulgence, being filled with delusion (“by worshiping this god with this mantra, I will get great treasures” and such ways), taking up all sorts of wrong wants (things such as liquor and meat etc.), and having fallen to impure disciplines, proceed to (worship small gods and such).

 #### Commentary 

“AsadgrAha” [wrongful wants] – those wants or desires that are “asat” [wrong] – meaning: that do harm and are blocks on the path of Emancipation – like: “perfecting such and such mantra, I will learn how to stupefy, enslave, cause mental disturbance to others etc.; by worshiping such and such gods I will make enormous amounts of money and I will know everything; I will make the impossible possible etc.” – trying for these types of impermanent pleasures.
 
“AshuchivratAh” – those whose “vratas” [vows; disciplines] are impure. “Vrata” = discipline [or: vow; practice]. The discipline that needs to be practiced with diet and behavior and such in order to attain perfection in some matter – that is “vrata.” The kinds of diet and behavior that make sattva guna grow, by which peaceful power gathers in the heart, the mind is purified and abandons restlessness, and thus the mind becomes able to attend to beneficent things – that is “shuchi vrata” [discipline of purity]. And the kinds of diet and behavior that make rajas and tamas gunas grow, by which restlessness and inebriation come to the mind, egotism is increased, and one does not have the ability to attend to beneficent things – that is “ashuchi vrata” [impure disciplines] – like rajasic and tamasic diet and behavior, etc.
 
Taking recourse in insatiable desires (like wanting to have the enjoyment of sensual pleasures through the worship of spirits, otherworldly beings, beings of ill repute), the wrongful things that are to be had by those who are filled with hypocrisy, arrogance and indulgence – they [the asura-natured] end up taking that. And they become adepts at the impure practices of consuming liquor and meat [and such].
