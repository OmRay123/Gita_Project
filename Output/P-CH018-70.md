अध्येष्यते च य इमं धर्म्यं संवादमावयो: |
ज्ञानयज्ञेन तेनाहमिष्ट: स्यामिति मे मति: || 70||
adhyeṣhyate cha ya imaṁ dharmyaṁ saṁvādam āvayoḥ
jñāna-yajñena tenāham iṣhṭaḥ syām iti me matiḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

The one who studies (recites as a “japa” [chant]) this dharma-containing dialogue between the two of us – by that person I shall have been worshipped by the yajna [fire-rite] of knowledge. This is certain to Me.

 #### Commentary 

The fortunate one who studies (does “manan” [contemplates] and “nididhyasan” [meditates]) this Spiritual Self-Enquiry in the guise of questions and answers (the dialogue between Keshava [Sri Krishna] and Arjuna) – ignorance will burn up in the fire of that person’s knowledge – meaning: the Everlasting Blessing of Liberation that comes forth when “I” am worshipped (glorified) through the fire-sacrifice of knowledge – that will happen with absolute certainty. This is My conviction (Truth from My Heart).
