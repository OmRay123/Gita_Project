#### Prose 

अहं हि सर्वयज्ञानां भोक्ता च प्रभुरेव च |
न तु मामभिजानन्ति तत्त्वेनातश्च्यवन्ति ते || 24||
ahaṁ hi sarva-yajñānāṁ bhoktā cha prabhureva cha
na tu mām abhijānanti tattvenātaśh chyavanti te

 #### Bengali Translation 

For I am the enjoyer of all yajnas [rites]; I am also their Lord. But because they [the ritualists] do not know Me properly – for this reason they return [to birth and death].

 #### Commentary 

To offer whole things ritually to burn in religious fire is called “yajna.” This is according to injunctions mentioned in “shruti” [that which is heard or Vedas and Upanishads], as well as “smriti” [that which is learned/remembered or other scriptures]. “Shruti” means teachings heard from unseen realms. The source that speaks it cannot be seen. But I got to hear it and understand it. And “smriti” is the remembrance of something that is already created. In the middle of both of these is “I”. When I go to offer as oblation the whole of the samsaric ignorance into [the flame] of “I”, then “I” Myself am the enjoyer and the Lord of all three: the “shruti” instructed yajnas [oblations into spiritual fire], the “smriti” instructed yajnas, and the yajna of offering the whole of samsaric ignorance. This “I” has to be known through the knowledge of substances – Muladhar and such. Not knowing that, and thus taking a separate/another “I”, brings about the possibility of returning [to the cycle of birth and death].
