śhītoṣhṇa-sukha-duḥkheṣhu tathā mānāpamānayoḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

The one who is “jitatma” [victorious over the self] and “prashanta” [in profound peace] – that being resides in the Supreme Self, directly realizing It to be the Self, in such a way that that sadhak remains unmoved in cold, heat, pleasure, pain, being respected and disrespected.

 #### Commentary 

That the Self of the “jitatma” [one who is victorious over the self] is the friend – that is being clearly stated in this sloka. Upon going above in Kriyayoga and attaining the states of being victorious over the senses and being “prashanta” [in profound peace] (devoid of likes, dislikes etc.), the sadhak sees the Self everywhere. The sadhak lives in the State of the Self. In that State, the sadhak directly realizes the Supreme Self-Being. While carrying on the experiences of prarabdha [karma associated with the incarnation] in samsara, even if that sadhak becomes stirred like ordinary people by cold, heat, pleasure, pain, being respected, being disrespected etc., that sadhak no longer breaks from the Supreme Self-ness. He/she continuously goes on experiencing that Company of the Supreme Self at all times.
