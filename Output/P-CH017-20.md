 #### Bengali Translation 

“One should give charity” – thinking like this, the charity that is given in holy places, at sacred places, for the benefit of worthy recipients who have not necessarily done any previous favor – that charity has been known as “sattvic charity.”

 #### Commentary 

The worthy recipient (Brahman, [sacred] place (the State of Vishnu of the yogic scriptures), time (the paravastha of Kriya) – the desire to offer (charity) that which is Mayic, untrue and non-substantial into this place, time and worthy recipient (there is no possibility of activity in Brahman, therefore there is no benefiting anyone with recompense involved) – this is that which is called “sattvic charity.”
