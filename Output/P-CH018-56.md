 #### Bengali Translation 

Even if he/she is doing all kinds of activities, the person who has taken refuge in Me, attains the Eternal, Inexhaustible State as My Blessing.

 #### Commentary 

I Am Vasudeva Brahman, the recourse of all, yet I am free of any recourse. All of the actions of this “I” are also devoid of recourse. That is why I am saying that: however many actions there may be, if one does them without taking recourse [in anything], and just stays locked [in the Self] – the Eternal, Inexhaustible State that comes about due to this “I” being appeased – that, due to practice, spontaneously/automatically comes into being.
