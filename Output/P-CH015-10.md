#### Prose 

उत्क्रामन्तं स्थितं वापि भुञ्जानं वा गुणान्वितम् |
विमूढा नानुपश्यन्ति पश्यन्ति ज्ञानचक्षुष: || 10||
utkrāmantaṁ sthitaṁ vāpi bhuñjānaṁ vā guṇānvitam
vimūḍhā nānupaśhyanti paśhyanti jñāna-chakṣhuṣhaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

At the time of death, the being who leaves the body, or the one who is in the body, or the one who is engaged in the enjoyment of the worldly experience, or the embodied one who is endowed with gunas (connected to the senses and such) – the ignorant ones cannot see that one. Only the persons who have the eye of knowledge can see [that being]. 

 #### Commentary 

This exiting from the body by the guna-endowed jiva at the time of death, the residing in the body and the enjoyment of the worldly experience – the ignorant ones (those caught up in enjoyments/partaking) cannot see that. Those whose sight of the eye of knowledge has opened – they are the ones who see. You are the witness of that.
