 #### Bengali Translation 

Those who practice this nectarous dharma [spiritual way] in the way that it has been now stated – those faithful/reverent devotees who are surrendered to Me are exceedingly dear to Me. 

 #### Commentary 

The devoted and faithful/reverent sadhak that correctly
practices this nectarous spiritual teaching given by Me – that being is
exceedingly dear to Me. (This is because that sadhak will most certainly
become “I” [alternate translation: is most certainly “I”].)
