 #### Bengali Translation 

Arjuna said: “Lord! By what signs does the embodied one go beyond the three gunas? What kind of character does that being have? Through what methods does that being become established by going beyond the three gunas?”

 #### Commentary 

The sadhak [spiritual practitioner], who is accustomed to go about as one who is under the powers of the actions and manifestations of the gunas, wanting to know how it all is with the characteristics, gait, and way of being in the state beyond the three gunas, as well as the enjoyment of Immortality while carrying on the body, is at the moment observing his/her state of consciousness from the time just before [this present state in this sloka], and saying: “O Lord. How does one go beyond those three gunas? By what signs are the great souls who are beyond the three gunas recognized? And how is the character and behavior of those great souls, or what kind [of characteristics and behaviors] do they display? Tell me these very things.
