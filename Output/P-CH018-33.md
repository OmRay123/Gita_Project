 #### Bengali Translation 

O Partha [Arjuna]! The steadfastness that is with one-pointed mind, and by which all actions of mind, energy and senses are carried out in an orderly way (properly) – that is verily sattvic steadfastness.

 #### Commentary 

That I have become a jiva [individual] and am engrossed in this created world, that I am doing “mine, mine” – this state of mine is my worldly state. And that in which the word “mine” cannot fit, where “I” am “I” Itself – that is My Expansive State of Brahman. To unite these two states is called “yoga” [union]. Through guru-instructed Kriya, upon my gathering up this contracted/confused worldly state of mine, and merging it in the Expansive “I” and thereby stopping the operations of mind, energy and senses, the uncorrupted (without vibrations) stillness that is there – the cultivation/ripening of that stillness – meaning: remaining locked in that [state] for a long time is called sattvic steadfastness.
