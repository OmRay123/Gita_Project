#### Prose 

अज्ञश्चाश्रद्दधानश्च संशयात्मा विनश्यति |
नायं लोकोऽस्ति न परो न सुखं संशयात्मन: || 40||
ajñaśh chāśhraddadhānaśh cha sanśhayātmā vinaśhyati
nāyaṁ loko ’sti na paro na sukhaṁ sanśhayātmanaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

The ignorant, irreverent and doubting persons become ruined. The doubting soul has neither this world nor the afterworld, nor is there happiness.

 #### Commentary 

The one who does not practice “pranipat,” “pariprashna” and “seva,” and thus does not know the matters to be known – meaning: the one who is not a Kriyavan – that person is “ignorant.” The one who does know by having practiced “pranipat” and such, but is not “shraddhavan” as according to the previous sloka – meaning: one who has not put mind into mind and is not established within – that one is “irreverent.” One who does not have steady faith in the words of guru-vedanta – meaning: because of being controlled by doubt, does not go forward to perform Kriya, and thus is inexperienced regarding the states of “shraddhavan” and such – that is the one who is the “doubting soul.” Amongst these, the first two are better because they can find some kind of way like fallen yogis. But the doubting soul not only does not have peace in either this world or the afterworld, even happiness is not there – meaning: because of the inner sky being covered with the darkness of ignorance, that person cannot even find the right way; that person just goes round and round in the painful burning of the cycles of samsara.
