#### Prose 

य एनं वेत्ति हन्तारं यश्चैनं मन्यते हतम् |
उभौ तौ न विजानीतो नायं हन्ति न हन्यते || 19||
ya enaṁ vetti hantāraṁ yaśh chainaṁ manyate hatam
ubhau tau na vijānīto nāyaṁ hanti na hanyate

 #### Bengali Translation 

The one who thinks that this Self can be killed, and the one who thinks that this [Atman/Self] is dead – both of them are not aware of the truth, because this Self does not kill anyone, nor does It die by anyone's doing.

 #### Commentary 

Dear sadhak – you go above and see. The Self is Total/Complete, and One Self is Itself the world/creation. Because there is no “two,” killer and killed – this simply is not possible at all. As long as one is in the worldly experience, for that long is the vision covered by ignorance. Greater vision or the vision of the subtle does not happen [in that state]. Thus, in that veiled vision, the feelings of “killer and killed” spring up. But, in Layayoga [the yoga of merging/dissolving], the distortion disappears immediately after crossing past the worldly experience. Ignorance is annihilated. The vision/perception becomes clear, and one sees the True Form of the All-pervading, Inexhaustible, Indestructible Self.
