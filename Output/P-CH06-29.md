#### Prose 

सर्वभूतस्थमात्मानं सर्वभूतानि चात्मनि |
ईक्षते योगयुक्तात्मा सर्वत्र समदर्शन: || 29||
sarva-bhūta-stham ātmānaṁ sarva-bhūtāni chātmani
īkṣhate yoga-yuktātmā sarvatra sama-darśhanaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

[The yogi,] via yoga, becomes united, having his mind in the Self, and having become endowed with the vision of “same-ness” in everything and every place, the yogi sees the Self as existing in all phenomena, and sees all phenomena existing in the Self.

 #### Commentary 

The sign of the state of being “jivanmukta” as stated in the previous slokas is this: the jivanmukta person resides in the Self and sees all phenomena as “same/as 'one'”; the yogi is endowed with the knowledge that there are no differences/divisions. For the yogi, all is indeed Brahman. Therefore, there is nothing separate from Brahman that comes to his/her vision. Dear sadhak! The Union with the Self that you attain when you come to the paravastha of the paravastha of Kriya – this sloka is attesting to and affirming that very thing. Compare it to your experience and see.
