#### Prose 

वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय
नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि |
तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णा
न्यन्यानि संयाति नवानि देही || 22||
vāsānsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya
navāni gṛihṇāti naro ’parāṇi
tathā śharīrāṇi vihāya jīrṇānya
nyāni sanyāti navāni dehī

 #### Bengali Translation 

Just as people throw away all old and worn-out clothes and take on all new clothes to wear – in the same way, all of the old and worn-out bodies are cast off and one takes on different bodies.

 #### Commentary 

The “death” that is seen in the world/samsara – that is just like the taking off of old clothes and the putting on of new clothes; it is only a change of covering. The jiva leaves the old, non-functioning body and takes on another, new body.
