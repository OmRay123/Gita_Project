 #### Bengali Translation 

Always and continuously bringing the mind under control in the aforementioned way, the yogi goes beyond sin, and enjoys the Highest Happiness in the form of the Realization of Brahman.

 #### Commentary 

The matters of both sloka 27 and sloka 28 [of this Chapter 6] are basically the same. In both, the yogi is “jivanmukta” [Liberated while alive in the body]. The difference is only this: in sloka 27, the yogi has taken shelter in Happiness; thus he/she is non-doing. In sloka 28, the yogi is the enjoyer of Happiness; thus, he/she is with activity. In sloka 27, the yogi is in the samadhi of Brahman. In sloka 28, the yogi is in the Awakened State of Brahman. The state in sloka 28 is the culminated result from the ripening of the state in sloka 27.
