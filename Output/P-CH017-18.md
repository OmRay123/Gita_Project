The austerity that is performed with hypocrisy for the sake of honor, respect and reverence – that impermanent and momentary austerity is called “rajasic austerity” in this plane. 

 #### Commentary 

People will call me a very holy saint and honor (praise) me. When they see me they will stand up, and [they will] show respect to me by doing prostrations and such, and [they] will worship me with offerings of money and such – austerity that is performed with these audacious intentions – like gathering up a worshipping ceremony just to show people, celebrating that one is fasting, gathering together many people to show that I am doing “Shivaratri” [a religious worshipping], but I am secretly drinking water [instead of fasting] in the back room – this kind of false austerity that is done just for a few days to buy fame, but which is without any benefit for the afterworld and with the nature of uncertainty – that austerity is called “rajasic austerity.”
