 #### Bengali Translation 

Then Arjuna beheld the divided innumerable parts of the entire creation situated together in the Body of that God of gods. 

 #### Commentary 

In the Body of that Vasudeva [the Omnipresent Lord], everything that there is – inanimate and animate (meaning: from a single particle to Shiva and such, and even all micro-beings) – however many kinds of things that can be seen in the universe-sheath – everything is there together. Through perfected awareness in sadhana, the sadhak (Arjuna) began to behold that.
