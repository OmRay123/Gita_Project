 #### Bengali Translation 

I see You wearing a crown, holding a mace, blazing everywhere with masses of light, dazzling the gaze, shining with radiance like fire and sun, and immeasurable. 

 #### Commentary 

Some are wearing “kireet” [crown] (“kireet” is headwear/hat that has a spire, is embedded with jewels-pearls-rubies [meaning: bejeweled] with tassels hanging). Some have a mace/club in their hands. Some have a discus [whirling weapon]. All are masses of light. The effulgence dazzles the eyes (but there is no discomfort in seeing it). What is this vision I am seeing?! It is difficult to keep my sight settled when looking at Your Form. It is beyond imagination/comparison. It is as if the sun, lightning and fire have mixed together and are blazing forth with light.
