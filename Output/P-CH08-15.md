#### Prose 

मामुपेत्य पुनर्जन्म दु:खालयमशाश्वतम् |
नाप्नुवन्ति महात्मान: संसिद्धिं परमां गता: || 15||
mām upetya punar janma duḥkhālayam aśhāśhvatam
nāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ sansiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

Having attained Me, great souls attain the Supreme Perfection (Liberation), and therefore, do not ever again take any temporal birth, which is just a house of sorrows.

 #### Commentary 

Those who can merge the antahkarana [personal being] into Supreme Self through the performance of [spiritual] yoga – they are the ones who attain “paramasiddhi” [the Supreme Perfection] – the State of Non-doing – and attain this “I” – meaning: they attain the Self Itself. Thus, they never again have to take a temporal birth, which is a house of sorrows – meaning: they never come back down. They fall into the Expansive Brahman and become Brahman Itself, Who is the Home of all Perfections.
