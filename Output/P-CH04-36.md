 #### Bengali Translation 

Even if you become greater in incurring sin than all sinners – even if that happens, you will [still] be able to easily cross the ocean of sins by the boat of gyana [knowledge].

 #### Commentary 

The one who is a “mumukshu” [one who deeply longs for Liberation] – even good karma is sin for that person. This is because: whether it is good or bad, if there is karma there cannot be Liberation. The reason is: if karma is not eliminated, one has to be bound to the fruits of good and bad. That bondage is that which is called sin. When the True Form of gyana [Knowledge] is known, because all of the vrittis [functionalities] of the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] become inward facing, all karmas – no matter how much in quantity, or even if they are innumerable – automatically fall off – meaning: as the knower of gyana has placed the chitta above the Agya in the place beyond karma, karma can no longer touch that being.
