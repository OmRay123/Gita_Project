#### Prose 

मूढग्राहेणात्मनो यत्पीडया क्रियते तप: |
परस्योत्सादनार्थं वा तत्तामसमुदाहृतम् || 19||
mūḍha-grāheṇātmano yat pīḍayā kriyate tapaḥ
parasyotsādanārthaṁ vā tat tāmasam udāhṛitam

 #### Bengali Translation 

The austerity that is practiced with no discrimination, wrong intentions and torturously, or the austerity that is done with the aim to destroy another/others – that is said to be “tamasic [austerity].”

 #### Commentary 

Like a stupid person without rationale and intelligence, saying “until I destroy so and so, I will not even drink water,” and emaciating and torturing the body, or engaging in wrongful spells (for killing, causing madness etc.) – [this type of austerity] is called “tamasic austerity.”
