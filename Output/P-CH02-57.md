#### Prose 

य: सर्वत्रानभिस्नेहस्तत्तत्प्राप्य शुभाशुभम् |
नाभिनन्दति न द्वेष्टि तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता || 57||
yaḥ sarvatrānabhisnehas tat tat prāpya śhubhāśhubham
nābhinandati na dveṣhṭi tasya prajñā pratiṣhṭhitā

 #### Bengali Translation 

One who is free of affection in all matters, does not become either happy or angry when good or bad comes – that person is “sthitaprajna.”

 #### Commentary 

Because of everything being realized as Brahman, only the “I”-awareness remains for that sadhak; the “mine”-awareness does not remain. Because that sadhak is always in the spiritual state, no lack happens for him/her. Thus, that sadhak has no beneficence and maleficence, no joy and sorrow.
