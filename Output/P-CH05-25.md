 #### Commentary 

Showing how the yogi attains Brahman-Nirvana in the previous sloka [5:24], the Lord is speaking about the matter of the attainment of Brahman-Nirvana by the sannyasi [renunciate]. The one who, through the performance of [spiritual] yoga renounces all karma and becomes “sage” - meaning: sees Oneness in all – it is that person who is “sannyasi” [one for whom all has ended]. That sadhak sees Brahman in everything, all the way to the source of creation itself. Thus, that being does not have any “kalmasha” - meaning: doubt. And again, as that sadhak's chitta is always in the unshakeable and united state of Brahman-ness, that sadhak is fully renunciate. And being full of benevolence, that sadhak brings blessings to all living beings – meaning: just by seeing that sadhak, the jiva experiences peace in the heart. And that being's teachings bring about the attaining of wisdom; maleficence is removed. Spending their time like this, the sannyasis attain Brahman-Nirvana.
