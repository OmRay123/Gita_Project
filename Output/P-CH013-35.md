 #### Bengali Translation 

In the [previously] stated ways, those who, through the eye of knowledge, know the distinctions between the field and the knower of the field, and know the method of Liberation of living beings from Prakriti – they go to the Supreme Truth (Brahman).

 #### Commentary 

That field, the knower of the field, Prakriti, the mutations of Prakriti (phenomena/living beings), and Liberation – meaning: the talk that has been given regarding being apart while being in all of this – in this, that the knower of the field is totally separate from the field, Prakriti, and the mutations of Prakriti – this is proved by the scriptures. And that teaching in the scriptures is proved by the teachings of guru. And the one who vows to do sadhana according to the teachings of the scriptures and the teachings of guru, and thereby directly sees the distinctions between the field and the knower of the field, and directly sees the way to be Liberated from the rulership of Prakriti through methods such as meditation etc., and thus comes to be settled in the Awareness of Self-knowing – for as long as that being remains in the body – for that long that being is jivanmukta [Liberated while living in the body], and upon the dropping off of the body [physical death], [that being] merges into the Infinite Form of Oneself – meaning: into Brahman – and that being never again has rebirth.
