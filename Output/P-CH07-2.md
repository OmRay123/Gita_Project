#### Prose 

ज्ञानं तेऽहं सविज्ञानमिदं वक्ष्याम्यशेषत: |
यज्ज्ञात्वा नेह भूयोऽन्यज्ज्ञातव्यमवशिष्यते || 2||
jñānaṁ te ’haṁ sa-vijñānam idaṁ vakṣhyāmyaśheṣhataḥ
yaj jñātvā neha bhūyo ’nyaj jñātavyam-avaśhiṣhyate

 #### Bengali Translation 

I will teach you completely about this “jnana” along with “vijnana.” By knowing this, there will not be anything left to know in this creation.

 #### Commentary 

When one transcends “karma” [spiritual action] and engages into “upasana” [being near the Lord], jnana and vijnana can be known by direct experience (by one's own experience). Nothing at all remains to be known. The sadhak is now engaged in that upasana. Thus, all that can be known is being known through the teachings from the mouth of the Beautiful One. Nothing is being left out.
