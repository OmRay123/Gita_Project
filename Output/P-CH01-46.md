#### Prose 

यदि मामप्रतीकारमशस्त्रं शस्त्रपाणय: |
धार्तराष्ट्रा रणे हन्युस्तन्मे क्षेमतरं भवेत् || 46||
yadi mām apratīkāram aśhastraṁ śhastra-pāṇayaḥ
dhārtarāṣhṭrā raṇe hanyus tan me kṣhemataraṁ bhavet

 #### Bengali Translation 

If the armed members of the side of Dhritarashtra find me unarmed and kill me [even though they see me unarmed], even that will be supremely beneficent for me.

 #### Commentary 

When contempt [such as this] comes to the mind, the sadhak goes on to think: “Okay, I am done. I am not going to perform yoga-Kriya any more. Not only am I not going to take up the weapon in the form of pranayam to destroy the magnetism of worldly vrittis, [but] I am not going to take any retaliatory action [against the vrittis of the worldly ways] whatsoever. If by doing this I end up writhing in the torment of being attacked by all of the Dhritarashtra-vrittis – meaning: the vrittis directed towards samsara – and even if I have to die because of that, even that is good. It is still not good to destroy the vrittis of all of the senses, become disabled in body, and exist like a dead man while still living. I have no need to perform this kind of yoga and get the Kingdom of Brahman.”
