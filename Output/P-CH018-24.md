 #### Bengali Translation 

But the action that is with the desire for results, or done by egotistical persons, and [the action] that is done with a great deal of struggle – that is called rajasic action.

 #### Commentary 

Durga Puja [an annual worshipping of the Divine Mother] is taking place at my house. The village is raucous with the sound of kettle- and barrel-shaped drums – this kind of fame-getting action is called rajasic action.
