यथा दीपो निवातस्थो नेङ्गते सोपमा स्मृता |

yogino yata-chittasya yuñjato yogam ātmanaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

Just as there is no flickering in the flame of a lamp when it is in a place with no [moving] air – one can use this simile to represent the concentrated mind.

 #### Commentary 

In a breeze-free place, the flame of a lamp becomes gradually fine and then becomes like the stem/tip of a sewing needle. This gradually made subtle flame is as still as a drawn picture, but the upward moving force is present in it. From the wick to the tip of the flame is the visible; just above that is the invisible (formlessness). After the mind is concentrated, just like that [the aforementioned], all of the vrittis gather together and enter via a current of stillness into an extremely subtle bindu and extinguish themselves – meaning: they [the vrittis] let go of their form-ness, which is their downfall, and become transformed into the Formlessness (into the Oneness).
