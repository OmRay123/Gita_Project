श्रुतिविप्रतिपन्ना ते यदा स्थास्यति निश्चला |

samādhāv-achalā buddhis tadā yogam avāpsyasi

 #### Bengali Translation 

When your intellect becomes ensconced in the Sound, and becomes fixed and immovable and thus becomes established in samadhi – it is then that you will have attained yoga.

 #### Commentary 

When one puts one's mind into the unbroken, unstruck Sound, the consciousness becomes enraptured by that, and stops holding onto the ability to understand, or anything else. It only remains magnetized to that Light that shines forth from the middle of that Sound. In this state, the power of knowingness becomes “shrutivipratipanna” - meaning: continuously listening to the Resonance of Pranava, it becomes centered and “nischala” [fixed] – meaning: it does not travel from one bindu to another bindu. Later, it becomes united with Brahman and becomes “achala” - meaning: still – meaning: no activities of the power of understanding remain. All of the types of vibrations cease. That vibration-ceased state is verily the state of yoga. As it is said in the Uttara Gita (Chapter 1, sloka 4015):
 
“anAhatasya shabdasya tasya shabdasya yo dvanih
dhvanirantargataṃ jyotirjyotirantargataṃ manah
tanmano vilayaṃ yAti tadviShNoh paramaṃ padam”
 
[within the sound that is unstruck, within that sound is the resonance
within that resonance is the light, within the light is the mind
where that mind is dissolved, that is the Supreme Vishnu-state]
