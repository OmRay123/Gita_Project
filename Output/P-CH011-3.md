एवमेतद्यथात्थ त्वमात्मानं परमेश्वर |
द्रष्टुमिच्छामि ते रूपमैश्वरं पुरुषोत्तम || 3||
evam etad yathāttha tvam ātmānaṁ parameśhvara
draṣhṭum ichchhāmi te rūpam aiśhwaraṁ puruṣhottama

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Parameshvara [Supreme God; Sri Krishna]! The way that You have spoken regarding the matters of the Self – it [the subject] is exactly like that. O Purushottama [Supreme Person; Sri Krishna]! I wish to see (that) Divine Form of Yours. 

 #### Commentary 

This “I” that has to be understood by going into the “you-consciousness,” the matters about Whom You have just spoken – it [the subject] is exactly like this. It [the “I”] is not otherwise. You are “Parameshvara” [Supreme God] – meaning: endowed with KnowledgeOpulence-Power-Strength-Potency-Energy/Light. O Purushottama [Supreme Person]! O the Life-Companion of the “you-consciousness”! I desire to see that Divine Form of Yours. All of the experiences that I have been having within – no doubt remains regarding them. But when I come out/outside, I mix up everything by seeing [reality as] this, that and the other. [I wish that You would] resolve these things for me. How is it that in one part – in one fragment – You are holding this entire creation – that is what I long to see.
