#### Prose 

सङ्करो नरकायैव कुलघ्नानां कुलस्य च |
पतन्ति पितरो ह्येषां लुप्तपिण्डोदकक्रिया: || 42||
saṅkaro narakāyaiva kula-ghnānāṁ kulasya cha
patanti pitaro hy eṣhāṁ lupta-piṇḍodaka-kriyāḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

It will be like hell for the corrupted castes and the destroyers of lineage. The ancestors of these [persons] will lose their “luptapindodakakriya” [a rite related to ancestral appeasement with the offering of rice balls and water] and surely fall (to hell).

 #### Commentary 

The Light of Brahman does not reveal Itself in the consciousness of an afflicted body. At that time, there is always troubled thinking [and] engagements and thoughts in bad directions [etc.]. Thus, the body is harmed from all sides [or: in all ways]. And that which comes during the continuous practice of Kriya in a healthy body from “anubhava” [ordinary meaning: experience] ([the meaning here] to become “anu” [atomic; subtlest of the subtle]):  the meetings with those great saints, the witnessing of the Light of Brahman, and the nectar that falls from the Sahasrar (udak [liquid]) and nourishes all and everything – all of those things disappear; pranayam (Kriya) does not happen on the correct “road.” Thus all such “anubhava” is destroyed. During the time of this “anubhava,” there is no awareness of the body, but all of the functions of the body continue through the activity of the subtle body, as if [the body is] in the waking state. After death, the ancestors, in shadowless energy forms, also experience acts in the subtle body; this can be seen. The ancestors' state and this state of “anubhava” is therefore the same; it is just that the physical body is not dead [for the sadhak] and so there is a slight difference. Because that “anubhava” too stops [because of aforementioned reasons], it is called the “fall of the realm of ancestors,” and the “disappearance of rice balls [representing the ancestors], water and rites.”
