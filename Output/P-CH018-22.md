यत्तु कृत्स्नवदेकस्मिन्कार्ये सक्तमहैतुकम् |
अतत्त्वार्थवदल्पं च तत्तामसमुदाहृतम् || 22||
yat tu kṛitsna-vad ekasmin kārye saktam ahaitukam
atattvārtha-vad alpaṁ cha tat tāmasam udāhṛitam

 #### Bengali Translation 

And that knowledge that is totally attached to one operative function (body or idols and such) (meaning: this [body or idol] itself is the Self or God – thoughts like this), [knowledge] that is without reason, devoid of lofty ideals, and trivial – know that that is that which is called tamasic knowledge.

 #### Commentary 

This small, indulgence-filled body is the only thing that is “I”, and everything that there is visible in the world is only for my enjoyment – the knowledge that makes one have this conclusion, the knowledge that is devoid of sensibility and reason, that does not aim for the Supreme Goal, and is small in significance [or: confused] – that is called tamasic knowledge.
