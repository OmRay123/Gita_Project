 #### Bengali Translation 

The one who serves, through single-minded bhakti-yoga, Me alone – that being goes beyond all of these gunas completely, and becomes fit to attain Brahman Itself. This is because I AM the Foundation (the Deity) of Brahman, and I AM also the Foundation of the Indestructible, Immortality, the Pure Dharma and Absolute Happiness as well.

 #### Commentary 

This “I” – the “I” that is Only and Alone, the One onto Whom no dabs of the waverings of addition or subtraction can be stuck – keeping this “I” unswerving in the way taught by guru – and, being free of all wavering, the one who makes the effort to merge [in the Self] – that one goes beyond all gunas and becomes That which is meant by the word “Brahman.” That Brahman is like this: the One Who simply Is and just Is, the One in Whom there is no end/limit, the One Who is Indestructible, the One Who is Eternal, the One Who is Dharma, the One Who is the Highest Happiness – That.

“BrahmaNo hi pratiShThAham” [I AM the Foundation of Brahman] – the meaning of this statement is: I AM the Deity [aspect] of Brahman – meaning: I am Brahman in Concentrated Form, or – I am Kutastha Chaitanya – like the concentrated aspect of the light [of the sun] is called the “solar sphere.” Energy and heat is unseen but they are all-pervading. With greater or lesser amounts (being subtle or extremely fine), the energy that is in every substance – as that energy concentrates in one place – as heat increases more and more, becomes intensified and concentrated, and then takes on a luminous form, and takes on the name of “fire-flame” – in the same way, the extremely subtle, unseen Consciousness-Essence (Brahman-Substance) becomes concentrated in the Kuta, takes on the Form of Revelatory Light, and takes on the name of “Aham” [“I”].

That is why this “Aham” or “I” is called “Ghana Chaitanya” [Concentrated Consciousness/Spirit]. It is for this reason that the Formless Brahman’s Foundation (Deity, Formed Consciousness, or Form [of Consciousness]) is “I”. I AM Brahman – Indestructibility Itself, Immortality Itself, the Pure Dharma Itself and Absolute Happiness Itself. But “Aham” is the Deity [aspect] of Brahman. That is why this “Aham,” the Supreme Bliss Itself, the Supreme Person Kutastha Chaitanya – is the Foundation of all of this.
