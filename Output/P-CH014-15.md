#### Prose 

रजसि प्रलयं गत्वा कर्मसङ्गिषु जायते |
तथा प्रलीनस्तमसि मूढयोनिषु जायते || 15||
rajasi pralayaṁ gatvā karma-saṅgiṣhu jāyate
tathā pralīnas tamasi mūḍha-yoniṣhu jāyate

 #### Bengali Translation 

When one dies during the time that rajoguna is predominant, one is born in the plane of humans, which is attached to karma [actions and their fruits]. And [if death occurs] during the time that tamoguna is predominant, the dead person takes birth in a womb of ignorance, such as animals etc.

 #### Commentary 

If the body is cast off during the operation of rajoguna, the human is enjoined to karma [actions and their fruits] and rebirth is given – meaning: [the event] makes one get the plane of humans. Similarly, if death occurs during the time that tamoguna is manifesting, it makes one take birth in the wombs of animals and birds and such. ([See] Chapter 8, sloka 6 [of the Bhagavad Gita].)
