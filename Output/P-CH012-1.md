अर्जुन उवाच |
एवं सततयुक्ता ये भक्तास्त्वां पर्युपासते |
ये चाप्यक्षरमव्यक्तं तेषां के योगवित्तमा: || 1||
arjuna uvācha
evaṁ satata-yuktā ye bhaktās tvāṁ paryupāsate
ye chāpy akṣharam avyaktaṁ teṣhāṁ ke yoga-vittamāḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

Arjuna said: “Those devotees who are constantly steadfast in worshipping You in this way, and those who worship only the Eternal Formless – which of them are more knowledgeable in yoga?” 

 #### Commentary 

The one who worships You constantly in that previously mentioned way, while having immovable faith in guru’s teachings, and the one who worships the Eternal Formless – which one among these two is higher (greater) in yogic knowledge? The sadhak is seeing: this witnessing of the Cosmic Form – the union of “I” and “You” did not happen in this. Is this sadhana [spiritual path] better, or – the one in which “I” and “You” become One – is that sadhana better? Which one of these is greater?
