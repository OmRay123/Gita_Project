 #### Bengali Translation 

Just as insects fly speedily into the flaming fire and die, in the same way, all beings/things are speedily entering into death in all of Your mouths. 

 #### Commentary 

Just as flying insects get drawn in by the current of the blazing fire, and they fall and die in it – in the same way, the emergenceand destruction-endowed abodes of impure ignorance (whatever there is that is seen) are coming to their extinction in Your mouth, like darkness ending when there is light.
