 #### Bengali Translation 

It is said that the divinely oriented endowments bring Liberation, and that the demonic endowments lead to bondage. O Pandava [Arjuna]! Do not grieve/worry. Your birth is of the divinely endowed.

 #### Commentary 

The jivas [souls] who are beings of divine endowments attain Liberation. Those who are beings of demonic endowments get choked in the bondage of Maya. At this time, as the question “with which kinds of endowments am I?” has arisen in the inner being of the sadhak, the sadhak is answering the question with his/her own Self-Knowledge. O Pandava [Arjuna; sadhak]! There is no need to grieve/worry any more. (In this place [of the Bhagavad Gita], Arjuna’s despondency from the first chapter [of the Bhagavad Gita] is dispelled.) You are born as one with divine endowments. Therefore, your Emancipation is inevitable.
