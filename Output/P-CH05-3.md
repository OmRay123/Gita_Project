#### Prose 

ज्ञेय: स नित्यसंन्यासी यो न द्वेष्टि न काङ् क्षति |
निर्द्वन्द्वो हि महाबाहो सुखं बन्धात्प्रमुच्यते || 3||
jñeyaḥ sa nitya-sannyāsī yo na dveṣhṭi na kāṅkṣhati
nirdvandvo hi mahā-bāho sukhaṁ bandhāt pramuchyate

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Mahabaho [mighty-armed one; Arjuna]! One who does not hate, does not crave either – that one should be known as the “nityasannyasi” [eternally renunciant]. This is because only the conflict-free person easily attains Liberation from the bindings of samsara.

 #### Commentary 

Desiring to attain powers in Kriya is “craving.” And the desire to get rid of the natural way of being is “hate.” One who is free of that hate and craving, and performs Kriya simply according to the teachings of guru, and takes care to see if Kriya is being performed just as was taught or not (other than this there are no other feelings in the mind) – it is only that person who is “nishkama” [without desire]. The conflicts of pleasure and pain, attraction and repulsion and such are not there in that person. For this kind of sadhak, no kinds of “kashmal” comes in front of him/her [see Chapter 2, sloka 2 for explanation of “kashmal”]. The path of the Self for that person remains free and clear. For this reason, “mukti” [emancipation] – meaning: merging in Vishnu-ness – is an easy attainment for that sadhak. This is why that sadhak is “nityasannyasi” [eternally renunciant].
