अर्जुन उवाच |
संन्यासं कर्मणां कृष्ण पुनर्योगं च शंससि |
यच्छ्रेय एतयोरेकं तन्मे ब्रूहि सुनिश्चितम् || 1||
arjuna uvācha
sannyāsaṁ karmaṇāṁ kṛiṣhṇa punar yogaṁ cha śhansasi
yach chhreya etayor ekaṁ tan me brūhi su-niśhchitam

 #### Bengali Translation 

Arjuna said, “O Krishna! After speaking about 'karmasannyas' [the renunciation of actions], You are again speaking about 'karmayoga' [the yoga of spiritual act/practice]. Which is greater amongst these two? Tell me about that particular one in a definite way.”

 #### Commentary 

In Chapter 4, from slokas 18 to sloka 41, the matters of surrendering all karmas [acts] have been stated. Yet again in sloka 42 [of Chapter 4] the matters of taking up yoga as the way of performing karma [spiritual act] is stated. But it is impossible to do both of these at the same time. Now, which one should be taken up? All is Brahman. Holding this idea, should one do nothing and be without action, or should one perform action? Because this kind of feeling has risen in the mind, the sadhak is asking this question, wanting to know which of these is superior.
