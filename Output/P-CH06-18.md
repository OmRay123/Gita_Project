#### Prose 

यदा विनियतं चित्तमात्मन्येवावतिष्ठते |
नि:स्पृह: सर्वकामेभ्यो युक्त इत्युच्यते तदा || 18||
yadā viniyataṁ chittam ātmanyevāvatiṣhṭhate
niḥspṛihaḥ sarva-kāmebhyo yukta ityuchyate tadā

 #### Bengali Translation 

When the chitta is very devoted and attains settledness in the Self alone – it is then that the yogi becomes devoid of the wish for any desires, and is known as “yukta” [united].

 #### Commentary 

In the 17th sloka [of this Chapter 6] it has been said that if one performs karma [spiritual practice] in a disciplined way, yoga (samadhi) happens. Now, when does one become “yukta” [united] upon performing karma [spiritual practice]? That is what is being spoken about in this sloka. When the chitta is one-pointed and becomes still in the Self alone, when there is nothing at all being held (contemplated) besides the Self, one stays within Oneself by Oneself – it is at that time that one is free of “all-thoughts” – meaning: earth, water, fire, air, ether – these are the “all” - because all connection to these is stopped, no more desires for them remain. One has recourse in only the Self alone. This is the state of “yukta” [being united].
