 #### Bengali Translation 

O “Purushottama!” O “Bhootabhavana!” O “Bhootesha!” O “Devadeva!” O “Jagatpate” – You Yourself know Yourself by Yourself. 

 #### Commentary 

“Bhootabhavana” = the Nourisher of “bhoota[s]” [living beings; phenomena; elements]; “Bhootesha” = the Deliverer of “bhootas”; “Devadeva” = the God of gods; “Jagatpati” [spelled with an “i” here for grammatical declension] – the Husband of Creation. “Purushottama” – The Prakritic veil is “pur” [abode]. Among these states that are there after the Prakritic veil is united [with the Self] – the state that is highest among them, above which there is no more “state” – That is “Purushottama.” How Glorious is Purush! And all of this is You! Lord! Lord! And now You are Me! That is why I am saying, I Myself am the Knower, I Myself am the Known, and I Myself am the Knowing.
