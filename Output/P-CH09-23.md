#### Prose 

येऽप्यन्यदेवता भक्ता यजन्ते श्रद्धयान्विता: |
तेऽपि मामेव कौन्तेय यजन्त्यविधिपूर्वकम् || 23||
ye ’pyanya-devatā-bhaktā yajante śhraddhayānvitāḥ
te ’pi mām eva kaunteya yajantyavidhi-pūrvakam

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! Those who, being My devotees and being full of faith, worship other gods – they are also worshipping Me, although in ignorance.

 #### Commentary 

When, by taking the implements of devotion and faith, there is the effort to worship another deity, that deity is never actually separate from “I”. This is because: when the sadhak worships that deity, the sadhak’s antahkarana [inner mind] merges with the form of that deity and takes on the form of that very deity. Thus, that deity too becomes “I”. But, as that person is under the power of ignorance and is deluded by the thinking of separateness, and thus separates that other god from “I” and worships it separately, and thinks that that god will be the one to bring blessings to him/her – just this much is the error. (It is because of this error that there is return [to birth and death]. See the next sloka.)
