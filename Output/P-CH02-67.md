#### Prose 

इन्द्रियाणां हि चरतां यन्मनोऽनुविधीयते |
तदस्य हरति प्रज्ञां वायुर्नावमिवाम्भसि || 67||
indriyāṇāṁ hi charatāṁ yan mano ’nuvidhīyate
tadasya harati prajñāṁ vāyur nāvam ivāmbhasi

 #### Bengali Translation 

Just as the wind tosses about a boat on water, similarly, whichever thing the mind pursues of the senses which are world-oriented, that very thing destroys the inner perception.

 #### Commentary 

Just by being a sadhak one knows that if the mind goes into the worldly experiences of sound and touch etc. [the sense perceptions], that itself brings about the end of the perception directed towards the Self.
