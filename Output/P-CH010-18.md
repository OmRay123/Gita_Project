bhūyaḥ kathaya tṛiptir hi śhṛiṇvato nāsti me ’mṛitam

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Janardan [Sri Krishna]! Tell me again about Your Yogic Glories and Your Vast Nature, because even after hearing the nectarous words from Your mouth, I am still not satisfied.

 #### Commentary 

That Self, that Pureness, that Self-Luminescence, that Sovereign-ness, that Non-doing/Formless State of Yoga – O Source of life and death! Tell me again about those Glories and Manifestations of Yours, fully and completely. Make me understand again. I am not satisfied by the little amount of that State that I have experienced.
