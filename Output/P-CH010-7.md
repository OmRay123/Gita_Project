etāṁ vibhūtiṁ yogaṁ cha mama yo vetti tattvataḥ
so ’vikampena yogena yujyate nātra sanśhayaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

The one who comes to know about all of these Glories/Manifestations of Mine as well as yogic truths (the adeptness in the manifestations of yoga) – that one becomes united to unwavering yoga. There is no doubt about this.

 #### Commentary 

This creation-vritti [creation-functionality] of Mine, this dissolution-vritti [of Mine] (addition [creation] and subtraction [dissolution]), and the “Kaivalya Sthiti” [Reality of Only-ness] that is before creation and after dissolution – these three together make up My “vibhuti-yoga.” “Vibhuti” [glories; divine manifestations/happenings; miracles] = extraordinary kind of manifestation. The extraordinary aspect is that there are millions and millions of microcosms in the form of living beings in the macrocosm. And “yoga” is to gather up those “vibhuti” [divine manifestations] and merge [in the Self]. One who witnesses these two [vibhuti and yoga] while [at the same time] being aware of the manifested experience – meaning: the time just before the dissolution that happens by the power of sadhana, when the state of being under the power of Prakriti is still there – the one who, in that state, sees this creation and the grand sport of this creation – for that being, at the time of dissolution – meaning: at the time of merging with “I” – there is no more taste for dancing about in the lusts for enjoyments. Thus, one falls into “I”, and there is the attainment of “Kaivalya” [Only-ness]. No shifting about happens in That. This is a statement that is without doubt.
