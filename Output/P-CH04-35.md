 #### Bengali Translation 

O Pandava [Arjuna]! The gyana [knowledge], knowing which one will never again fall to delusion like this, by which all beings/phenomena – even Brahmaa [creator aspect] and such great ones – are seen – without leaving anyone/anything out – first in yourself, and then in Me. 

 #### Commentary 

After knowing gyana through those three means [see commentary to previous sloka – 4:34], one can directly see: like the jewels strung together on a thread, all beings/phenomena are present in the Self. Nothing at all is left out. For this reason, one never has to again fall into the samsara-delusion (into being fooled) of “me and mine.” Then, “bhootani” (the whole of the universe; all that there is in creation), “atma” [self] (finite consciousness; the sadhak), and “ahang” [or: ahaṃ] (Indestructible Brahman) – all of these become one in the Vision of the Self. Thus, whatever is seen at that time – the Knowingness “I Am That” is experienced in everything that is seen.
