 #### Bengali Translation 

The Lord said: “This difficult-to-see Form of Mine that You have witnessed – the gods are constantly longing to see this Form.” 

 #### Commentary 

The sadhak, again rising back up to the Consciousness of the Self, is resolving the previous experiences. This Incredible Form of Mine, That Which can only be seen after intense sadhana [spiritual practice] – I have seen that the gods (the luminous, subtle-body endowed consumers of karmic fruits are called “devatas” [gods; demi-gods]) constantly long to see that Form. If one does not have the waking-state in a physical body along with rajoguna, sadhana does not happen. The gods lack these. That is why they cannot do sadhana. And without doing sadhana, there is absolutely no way of seeing that Incredible Form.
