#### Prose 

न च तस्मान्मनुष्येषु कश्चिन्मे प्रियकृत्तम: |
भविता न च मे तस्मादन्य: प्रियतरो भुवि || 69||
na cha tasmān manuṣhyeṣhu kaśhchin me priya-kṛittamaḥ
bhavitā na cha me tasmād anyaḥ priyataro bhuvi

 #### Bengali Translation 

There is no one who is more dear to Me amongst human beings than that being [the aforementioned teacher in 18:68]. And no one in the world besides that being will be My dearest.

 #### Commentary 

Having taken on this human body, when the jiva becomes this “I” through the strength of sadhana [spiritual practice] – there is no one else who has the possibility of being dearer to “I” than that person, whether in the past, future or present. This is because as that being has become a ruler over Maya, that being also gives the power to have rulership over Maya to another and rescues that other being.
