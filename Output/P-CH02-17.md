#### Prose 

अविनाशि तु तद्विद्धि येन सर्वमिदं ततम् |
विनाशमव्ययस्यास्य न कश्चित्कर्तुमर्हति || 17||
avināśhi tu tadviddhi yena sarvam idaṁ tatam
vināśham avyayasyāsya na kaśhchit kartum arhati

 #### Bengali Translation 

The One Who pervades this entire creation – know Him to be the Indestructible. No one can destroy this “Avyaya” [Inexhaustible].

 #### Commentary 

Just as a claypot is nothing but clay made up of the atoms and particles [of clay] and nothing else; if one breaks the pot, the clay remains just as clay – the Self and this universe are the same. Whether the universe is broken down or built up, the Self remains as It is. This universe is Atman-filled [Self-filled]. Therefore, there is no place which is without the Self. Just as: ice, liquid, steam are three forms of water and have three names; the substance remains the same as it is; there is only the difference in the states and their names – in the same way, jiva, Maya, Brahman are the states of the same Atman [Self] with different names. That is why the Self is “Avyaya” - meaning: cannot be spent. Thus, when Someone is this kind of Indestructible, how can That One be destroyed?
