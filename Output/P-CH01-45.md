 #### Bengali Translation 

Uff! What a calamitous situation! We are about to incur great sin as we get ready to destroy our own people, driven by our greed for the pleasures of the kingdom.

 #### Commentary 

O Lord! O Lord! I have fallen into the delusional sorcery called yoga! And that “caste” of mine that is my body – I am destroying that and putting my hand out to get a kingdom. Alas, what a great sin I am committing! I – myself – am destroying my own body. I am committing suicide. How great is this greed for pleasure!! Shame! Shame! Shame!!!
 
Upon starting up with yoga, the sadhak at first cannot understand the science of yoga because of being under the power of ignorance and thus feels weary and hopeless. At that time, the kinds of thoughts stated in slokas 28 to 43 [of Chapter 1] go on in the mind, and this kind of contempt comes about.
