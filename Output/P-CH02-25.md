#### Prose 

अव्यक्तोऽयमचिन्त्योऽयमविकार्योऽयमुच्यते |
तस्मादेवं विदित्वैनं नानुशोचितुमर्हसि || 25||
avyakto ’yam achintyo ’yam avikāryo ’yam uchyate
tasmādevaṁ viditvainaṁ nānuśhochitum arhasi

 #### Bengali Translation 

It is said that this Self is Inexpressible, Unthinkable, and Immutable. Therefore, knowing that the Self is like this, it is not appropriate for you [Arjuna] to grieve like this.

 #### Commentary 

In the 23rd sloka [of this Chapter 2], it has been stated that the Self is unaffected by earth, water, fire and air. And now, in this sloka [25 of Chapter 2] it is being said that even space cannot touch the Self, because It is “Avyakta” [Inexpressible; Unspeakable] – meaning: because of being extremely Subtle, it cannot be revealed even through sound [the sense aspect associated with the element of space]. The antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] cannot grasp It because It is “Achintya” [Unthinkable] – meaning: It is not even able to be contemplated. The Self is “Avikarya” [Immutable] – meaning: beyond Maya (all mutations that there are – those happen in Maya alone; they do not happen in the Self; it is like trying to spray ink on space). You yourself have the practical experience of these states – meaning: having gone above the Kutastha [alternate translation: having gone to the top of Kutastha], you have known this through your own awareness and have spoken about it (“uchyate” [declared]). Therefore, knowing the Self in this way, it is not fitting for you to grieve like this.
