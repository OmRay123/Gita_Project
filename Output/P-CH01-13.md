#### Prose 

तत: शङ्खाश्च भेर्यश्च पणवानकगोमुखा: |
सहसैवाभ्यहन्यन्त स शब्दस्तुमुलोऽभवत् || 13||
tataḥ śhaṅkhāśhcha bheryaśhcha paṇavānaka-gomukhāḥ
sahasaivābhyahanyanta sa śhabdastumulo ’bhavat

 #### Bengali Translation 

After that, the sounds from “shankha” [conch-shell], “bheri” [kettle-drum], “panava” [small drum or cymbal], “aanaka” [drum], “gomukha” [a wind instrument from a shell] and such sounded out together. That sound grew to a tumultuous level. 

 #### Commentary 

When the sadhak gets to this state, because of vital air entering the gates of the openings in the nadis in his/her body, many types of sounds arise. It is like when horns, kettle-drums, large drums, barrel drums, cymbals, and flutes sound together and create a feeling of a disturbing chaos; these sounds are also like that. Like hearing the chaotic sounds of a marketplace from quite a distance – it is like that.
