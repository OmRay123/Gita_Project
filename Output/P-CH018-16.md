tatraivaṁ sati kartāram ātmānaṁ kevalaṁ tu yaḥ
paśhyaty akṛita-buddhitvān na sa paśhyati durmatiḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

About that matter (regarding all types of acts), even if it is like this (meaning: even with these five causalities/factors) – the person that views [through thought alone] the Self as the attribute-less, unassociated Doer – that imperfect perception, because of it being from an unenlightened intellect, cannot see the whole.

 #### Commentary 

I am the Self, Only-Rama, Eternal, Immaculate, Free Non-doer. Not one of the five [causalities/factors] that have been mentioned can touch me. But those who [actually] think “I see” when the eyes see, “I do” when the hands do, “I make” when the mind makes, “I have made certain” when the intellect is making certain – by making themselves (own selves) as “doer”, they remain with unrealized intelligence (they believe in the “I am the body” vanity) and wrong perception (meaning: their opinion or mind stays with the causalities/factors of birth and death; they cannot remain in the Self as the Self; they remain far away from the Self). That is why they, even while seeing “I”, cannot see It. They go around and about far away [from the Truth].
