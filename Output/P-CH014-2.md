 #### Bengali Translation 

By taking refuge in this knowledge, they attain My Self, and thus, they are not born at the time of creation, nor do they suffer at the time of dissolution.

 #### Commentary 

This supreme and best knowledge that is being spoken about – this knowledge – if one performs spiritual practice with intense force, one attains the Dharma of “I” – meaning: one attains the Self Itself; one merges in Brahman. Just as delusional fear of a snake automatically leaves when it is seen that it is just a rope-bunch that is laying there – it is like that. In this state, there is neither duality nor non-duality – no mutations of perception are there. So naturally, creation-time’s emergence and dissolution-time’s destruction – there is no space for the sufferings caused by any of the pains of these two.
