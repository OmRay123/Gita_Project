सुखदु:खे समे कृत्वा लाभालाभौ जयाजयौ |
ततो युद्धाय युज्यस्व नैवं पापमवाप्स्यसि || 38||

tato yuddhāya yujyasva naivaṁ pāpam avāpsyasi

 #### Bengali Translation 

Know “sukha” and “duhkha” [pleasure and pain, respectively], “labh” and “alabh” [gain and loss, respectively], and “jaya” and “parajaya” [victory and defeat, respectively] to be the same, and engage (present yourself) in the cause of this war. In this way (if you fight) you shall not incur sin.

 #### Commentary 

“Sukha” [happiness; pleasure] has been explained in the commentary of the 32nd sloka [of this Chapter 2]. “Duhkha” [pain; sorrow]: “duh” = darkness/dirty/defiled; “kha” = space; the presence of “vasana” [deeply rooted desire] itself causes the inner space to be covered up with the “veiling-power.” Then an empty, lack-filled, darkness-filled state comes about. That beautiful Light of the Self – even a single ray of it cannot be seen. There is a kind of gasping in the pranas; the mind feels hopeless. That is “duhkha.” Making pleasure and pain, gain and loss, and victory and defeat the same – meaning: being unperturbed in distress and detached in happiness – like: “I am fighting such [a battle] for the sake of fighting (because guru said so)” – in this way, leaving behind the desire for outcomes, take up fighting in the war dutifully – meaning: take up the task to end pravritti-ways. If you do this, sin (restlessness – that which makes the sadhak lose his/her unmoving position and aim) cannot touch you – meaning: no matter if you are in “karma,” “akarma” or “vikarma” [see definitions in the Introduction, Part 4, definitions number 1], you will get the Endless Settledness in Brahman.
