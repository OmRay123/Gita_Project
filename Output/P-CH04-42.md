 #### Bengali Translation 

Therefore, O Bharata [Arjuna]! Cut asunder this non-discerning doubt – which proceeds from the ignorance that destroys oneself, and which resides in your heart – with the scimitar of your own Knowing, and get up and take up yoga.

 #### Commentary 

Dear sadhak! “Kathaṃ bheeShmahaṃ saṃkhye” [how will I battle Bhishma [ego]] and such types of doubts that you have in regards to the matters of the Self – because you did not perform the karma [yogic act] according to what was prescribed for your mind – that is why, all this time you were not able to know what gyana is, and thereby, you were enjoined with ignorance, and thus the doubts regarding your True Form and your capabilities had come about. But now you quite understand everything. Why wait any more? Abandon doubts. Abandoning these doubts is in your own hands. If one, upon understanding by oneself, does not abandon by oneself the doubts that one has, no one else can do that [for him/her]. This is where the great achievement is. This is where the great accomplishment is. Guru simply shows the place and not more. One must go through that place by one's own power. Take this up! Now get up and sit on top of the place of yoga. Sit, and perform yoga according to the proper injunctions.
