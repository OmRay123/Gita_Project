संन्यासस्तु महाबाहो दु:खमाप्तुमयोगत: |
योगयुक्तो मुनिर्ब्रह्म नचिरेणाधिगच्छति || 6||
sannyāsas tu mahā-bāho duḥkham āptum ayogataḥ
yoga-yukto munir brahma na chireṇādhigachchhati

 #### Bengali Translation 

But, O Mahabaho [mighty-armed; Arjuna]! Sannyas [renunciation] without [spiritual] yoga brings about suffering. One who unites through karmayoga [practice of spiritual yoga] – that one becomes “muni” [sage] and quickly realizes Brahman (“parmartha sannyas” [ending oneself in the Supreme Truth]).

 #### Commentary 

It is true all right that the result of both sannyas [renunciation] and yoga  [spiritual practice] are the same, but sannyas does not happen without the performance of yoga. This is because the only way to purify the chitta [heart; personal consciousness] is through [spiritual] yoga. If someone takes up sannyas without having performed yoga, then that person becomes helplessly pulled to the worldly experience. Because the vrittis [functionalities] of the sense-tendencies all remain strong, nothing at all gets renounced. But if one becomes spiritually engaged through yoga, as the mind goes to Kutastha and realizes the Kutastha Purush by seeing and knowing, everything quickly gets destroyed and one attains Settledness in Brahman. This Brahman is That Which is “sannyas” [where all ends] - “saṃnyAso brahma uchyate” [it is said that Brahman is “sannyas”]. (For as long as the chitta is not purified, for that long does karmayoga and sannyas remain different. Later both are known as one.)
