O Partha [Arjuna]! That by which pravritti [outward modes] and nivritti [inward modes], “karya” [the to-be-done] and “akarya” [the not-to-be-done], “bhaya” [fear] and “abhaya” [fearlessness], and “bandha[n]” [bondage] and “moksha” [Liberation] are known – that verily is sattvic intellect. 

 #### Commentary 

Pravritti (Chapter 16, sloka 7 [of the Bhagavad Gita]). Nivritti (Chapter 16, sloka 7 [of the Bhagavad Gita]). “Karya” [the to-be-done] – [that which is] incomplete, that which has not been done [but/and] has to be done; and “akarya” [the not-to-be-done] – that which has already been done [and] one does not have to do it. “Bhaya” [fear] – the remembrance/awareness of death. “Abhaya” [fearlessness] – “I” Am Immortal – this certain knowledge. “Bandha[n]” [bondage] – the state of “jiva” [individual person]. “Moksha” – the presiding knowledge of Brahman. O Partha [Arjuna; the sadhak]! The intellect by which these are known with certainty – that is called sattvic intellect.
