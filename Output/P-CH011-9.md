 #### Bengali Translation 

Sanjaya said: “O King [Dhritarashtra]! After speaking in this way, Mahayogeshvara Hari [Sri Krishna] revealed His Divine Form to Partha [Arjuna].

 #### Commentary 

“Saṃ” + “jaya” = “sanjaya” [can be transliterated from Sanskrit as “saṃjaya” as well, but is pronounced in Bengali as “sanjaya”] – meaning: the settled state that is there upon having the knowledge of cause, action, quality and meaning – that is the state of “sanjaya.” When the sadhak looks downward while being in the Ajna-chakra and sees the sport of the phenomenal world – it is at that time that the sadhak has no attraction for any worldly experience. This detached perception [with no attraction to the world] is that which is called Divine Sight. This is verily the sadhak’s state of “sanjaya.” Whatever is being seen and experienced/felt while being in this state – that is what is being expressed as “Sanjaya said.” All of these are internal, mind to mind. In this state, the mind is the speaker; the mind is the listener. As speaker, one is Sanjaya; as listener, one is Dhritarashtra [see commentary to Chapter 1, sloka 1 of the Pranab Gita], who, as he is the experiencer/owner of the pleasures and pains of the kingdom of the body, is known as “king.” Greater than the greatest, Yogeshvara [the Lord of yoga/yogis] Hari (one who does “haran” [takes away] of “sarva” [all that exists in creation]) bestowed upon Arjuna the Divine Eye and revealed to him that Reality of God – “Param” [Supreme].
