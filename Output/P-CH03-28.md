#### Prose 

तत्ववित्तु महाबाहो गुणकर्मविभागयो: |
गुणा गुणेषु वर्तन्त इति मत्वा न सज्जते || 28||
tattva-vit tu mahā-bāho guṇa-karma-vibhāgayoḥ
guṇā guṇeṣhu vartanta iti matvā na sajjate

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Mahabaho [mighty armed one; Arjuna]! The separation between the gunas and the Self, and the separation between actions and the Self – the one who knows the truth of these two – that person knows that all of the sense-organs are being engaged in the worldly experience (I am not being engaged), and thus does not have the vanity of doership.

 #### Commentary 

When the sadhana of the Kriya of the Self excels, the gunas, acts and the Self and all of these – the truth of their separateness and how actions take place come to be known experientially. And through discernment of intellect, the pure “I” aspect blossoms forth. Then, all of the activities get carried out automatically because of sense-organs connecting with the worldly experience. The sense “I am doing” does not come at all.
