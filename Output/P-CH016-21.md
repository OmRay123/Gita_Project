 #### Bengali Translation 

Lust, anger and greed – these are the three types of doors to hell, and they are harmful to the soul (they bring about births in low-level wombs). For this reason, abandon these three.  

 #### Commentary 

“Narak” [hell] (“na” = negation, “raṃ” = light, “kaṃ” = head) – the state in which there is no revelation of the Light of the Self in the head – that is “narak” [hell] – meaning: ignorance/unawareness, or being without discrimination/wisdom, is that which is “narak” [hell]. This hell – it has three doors. One is lust, another is anger, and another is greed. When one is enslaved by this lust-anger-greed, one gets that state of “narak.” And the soul is harmed – meaning: due to the covering up of Self-Knowledge, the individual soul descends to lower places. It takes birth in low-consciousness wombs. Therefore, know that these three active forces are to be abandoned by those longing for Liberation.
