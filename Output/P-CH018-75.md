 #### Bengali Translation 

By the grace of Vyasa, I have directly heard this supremely secret yoga from the words of the Lord of Yoga, Sri Krishna Himself. 

 #### Commentary 

By the grace of Vyasa – meaning: with the help of discernment (if there were no discernment [of distinct matters], I would have remained in the State of the One Brahman-Expanse; if it were so, then this dialogue would not even happen – that is what he [Sanjaya] is saying), this secret dialogue that is much deeper than any secret, this yoga – meaning: the matter of the union of oneself with the Self (no union can happen if there are not “two”) – I have now heard as a direct teaching from the Lord of Yoga, Sri Krishna’s (meaning: the One Who attracts and pulls one and bestows Liberation – that Kutastha Being’s) own mouth.
