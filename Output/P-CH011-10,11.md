 #### Bengali Translation 

(That Form) is with many mouths and eyes, many wondrous manifestations, many Divine Ornaments, many upheld Divine Weapons, Divine Garlands and Divine Vestments, is full of Divine Scents, is completely wondrous, Radiant and Infinite, and is facing in all directions. 

 #### Commentary 

[The Form is with] many mouths, many eyes, [and there are] many incredible sights (which have not been previously seen in sadhana); there are many ornaments, and many weapons and missiles ([see] Chapter 10, sloka 31 [of the Gita]) are being held. All are formed out of Space! Garlands made out of Space, Vestments made out of Space – all are blazing forth with the Light of that Form. The anointing substances of vermillion, musk and sandal are in Space; all are wondrous. The Form is shadowless, immeasurably Luminous. Not just one or two things – the manifestations are innumerable. Whatever known or unknown that there is in the universe-sheath – all of it is coming out. (See “vishvatomukhah” in Chapter 10, sloka 33 [of the Gita].)
