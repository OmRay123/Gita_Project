#### Prose 

गाण्डीवं स्रंसते हस्तात्त्वक्चै व परिदह्यते |
न च शक्नोम्यवस्थातुं भ्रमतीव च मे मन: || 30||
gāṇḍīvaṁ sraṁsate hastāt tvak chaiva paridahyate
na cha śhaknomy avasthātuṁ bhramatīva cha me manaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

I cannot sit here any more. It is as if my mind is spinning. O Keshava [Sri Krishna]! I am seeing all kinds of inauspicious omens.

 #### Commentary 

At this time, the sadhak feels extremely helpless and cannot even take one more step forward in sadhana. The mind, having become very restless, starts to wander everywhere [or: spins], and inauspicious omens begin to be seen. So, naturally, the sadhak is bound to say, “I thought yoga is supposed to be for the attainment of Peace in the Supreme State – instead of that happening – O Keshava [Sri Krishna]! (See the 14th sloka of the 10th Chapter for the meaning of “Keshava.”) What I am seeing is exactly the opposite – torturous, full of terrible pain – like experiencing hell. I cannot remain still any more.
