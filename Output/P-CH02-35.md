#### Prose 

भयाद्रणादुपरतं मंस्यन्ते त्वां महारथा: |
येषां च त्वं बहुमतो भूत्वा यास्यसि लाघवम् || 35||
bhayād raṇād uparataṁ mansyante tvāṁ mahā-rathāḥ
yeṣhāṁ cha tvaṁ bahu-mato bhūtvā yāsyasi lāghavam

 #### Bengali Translation 

The great warriors will think of you as a person who has become a coward in war. Those who think of you as the greatest – you will become small in their perception.

 #### Commentary 

When someone is a failure, it is not just that the competent people from the outside that show disrespect or disdain; the primary vrittis of pravritti and nivritti (“the great warriors”) that are within oneself also come up in the mind and bring about reproach in oneself. Then one thinks, “Alas! Alas! Out of fear I withdrew (went backwards)! I could not accomplish the work! Shame on me!” In this way, the self-confident power that was previously there over the vrittis [becomes diminished]; later, because of the vrittis now becoming the rulers, one becomes reduced [in self-confidence] a bit. One cannot summon up in the mind the same kind of mental strength as before. Dear sadhak! Compare all of this to all of your experiences and see if [what is said here] matches. It will all match up.
