But the Supreme Person (different from “kshara” and “Akshara”) is known as “Paramatma.” [Supreme Self], the One Who is God and Non-diminishing. And He has entered the three worlds and is ruling them. 

 #### Commentary 

There is another Purush Who is separate/different from “kshara” and “Akshara.” He is called “Uttam Purush” [Supreme Person]. There is no purush [being] that is higher than Him. He has no names such as “purush” or forms. Yet. because He is above all “purushes” [beings], He is called “Purushottama” [Higher than purush; Supreme Purush]. Although He is absolutely different from those two titled purushes, and because of being present in all phenomena and beings as Consciousness/Spirit Itself – as the inner Self (Supreme Self) and being in Earth, the underworld and heaven – He is beyond the ignorance-created bodies and such with the five sheaths. Yet, He is holding the cosmos with His own Consciousness-Strength and Power, and is the Non-diminishing Ruler. For this reason, He is called “Uttam Purush” [Supreme Person]. “Asaṃspṛshya shareereNa yena vishvaṃ chiraṃ dhṛtam” [without contacting body, ever holds the cosmos].
