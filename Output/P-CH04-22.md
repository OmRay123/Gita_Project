#### Prose 

यदृच्छालाभसन्तुष्टो द्वन्द्वातीतो विमत्सर: |
सम: सिद्धावसिद्धौ च कृत्वापि न निबध्यते || 22||
yadṛichchhā-lābha-santuṣhṭo dvandvātīto vimatsaraḥ
samaḥ siddhāvasiddhau cha kṛitvāpi na nibadhyate

 #### Bengali Translation 

When one is content with whatever comes to one, is beyond conflict, is devoid of ill-naturedness, and knows that attainment and non-attainment are the same, even if that person performs actions, he/she is not bound by them.

 #### Commentary 

The “pandit” [see commentary to sloka 4:19] sees Brahman in everything there is. Because he/she has no desire or need to attain anything, whatever comes spontaneously through the carrying on of the bodily life – that person is content with just that. For that person, there is no perception of good and bad, no difference between mine and theirs, no feelings of enmity – for that person all is actually Brahman. Therefore, “siddhi” - meaning: the attainment of attainments – Kaivalya-Sthiti [abiding in Only-ness], and “asiddhi” [non-attainment] – meaning: just being – all are the same. Because of not having any awareness of duality, even if that person is caught up in actions, he/she does not actually get wrapped up.
