#### Prose 

हतो वा प्राप्स्यसि स्वर्गं जित्वा वा भोक्ष्यसे महीम् |
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चय: || 37||
hato vā prāpsyasi swargaṁ jitvā vā bhokṣhyase mahīm
tasmād uttiṣhṭha kaunteya yuddhāya kṛita-niśhchayaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! If you get killed, you will be able to go to heaven. If you are victorious, you will be able to enjoy the world. Therefore, “uttiShTha” [stand up]! [see spiritual meaning in the commentary below] and be resolved to fight. 

 #### Commentary 

If you die while continuously being engaged in this sadhana-war, you will attain heaven (the destiny of the Self). This is why: if one leaves the body while continuously doing the work of Sat [Truth], only the Substances of Sat will come at the time of death. Thus, the destiny will be according to Sat (see Chapter 6, slokas 40-46). And if you are victorious, then: “maheeṃ bhokshyase” - meaning: you will enjoy the kingdom of wonders/miracles without any enemies (see the 8th sloka [of this Chapter 2]) – meaning: you will be “jivanmukta” [Liberated while still living in this body]. Therefore, be resolved to fight the war and be established up above (“ut-tiShTha” [established above]) (see the 3rd sloka [of this Chapter 2]).
