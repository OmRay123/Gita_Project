#### Prose 

यदक्षरं वेदविदो वदन्ति
विशन्ति यद्यतयो वीतरागा: |
यदिच्छन्तो ब्रह्मचर्यं चरन्ति
तत्ते पदं संग्रहेण प्रवक्ष्ये || 11||
yad akṣharaṁ veda-vido vadanti
viśhanti yad yatayo vīta-rāgāḥ
yad ichchhanto brahmacharyaṁ charanti
tat te padaṁ saṅgraheṇa pravakṣhye

 #### Bengali Translation 

The One Who is called “Akshara” [Indestructible] by the knowers of the Vedas, the One in Whom the passion-free practitioners of austerity enter, that One – because of the desire to know Whom, the vow of “brahmacharya” [ordinary definition: celibacy; see commentary below for spiritual definition] is taken up (by sadhaks) – I am telling you in a concise way (how to attain) that State.

 #### Commentary 

Those who have not read the Vedas – they are “itara” [unlettered]. Those who have read the Vedas but have not come to understand the real meaning of the Vedas – this type of embodied being is called “bhadra” [cultured]. The ones who have read the Vedas, and through the Grace of Srigurudev have understood the real meaning of the Vedas – they are the ones who are called “vedavit” [knowers of the Vedas]. “Veda” (“vit” + “gha-jna”) – meaning: “jnana” [knowledge]. One who has known this “jnana” – that person is the one that is called “budh” [knower] or “jna” [knower]. The One Who is called “Akshara Brahman” [Indestructible Brahman] by those “budhs,” the One Who is entered into, with great care, by the austerity-practicing “veetaragis” (passion-free ones) – meaning: those who witness the Indestructible One, or enter into the Indestructible One, upon being free of conflict and doubt, and, upon coming to the end of desire – meaning: finishing desire – the Brahman in Whom the yogis do “charan” [move], and thereby become “brahmacharis” [those who go about in Brahman] – that State is verily “tatpada” [the State of That] or the Supreme State of Vishnu. How that State is to be attained – that is what is being stated in the next sloka.
