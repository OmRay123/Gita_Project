#### Prose 

वेदाविनाशिनं नित्यं य एनमजमव्ययम् |
कथं स पुरुष: पार्थ कं घातयति हन्ति कम् || 21||
vedāvināśhinaṁ nityaṁ ya enam ajam avyayam
kathaṁ sa puruṣhaḥ pārtha kaṁ ghātayati hanti kam

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Partha [Arjuna]! The person who knows this Self to be without birth, without destruction, Eternal and Indestructible – in what way can that person cause to get someone killed, and whom? And how and whom does that person kill?

 #### Commentary 

The one (upon the performance of special Kriya) who goes above and knows (experiences directly) the Self to be Indestructible, Eternal, Ageless and Inexhaustible (devoid of diminution), that one attains “Purush” [[Supreme] Person] - meaning: that [sadhak] attains the “avyaktAt para” [the Supreme Inexpressible] – that Supreme Destiny. In Him (since everything becomes One), no reason remains to cause anyone to kill anyone. So, who does what? Just by being a jiva, the jiva is Prakriti. But just upon crossing beyond the world-experience, one casts off one's “Prakriti-ness” and becomes “Purush” or Shiva. The activities of Prakriti do not touch Purush.
