#### Prose 

नियतस्य तु सन्न्यास: कर्मणो नोपपद्यते |
मोहात्तस्य परित्यागस्तामस: परिकीर्तित: || 7||
niyatasya tu sannyāsaḥ karmaṇo nopapadyate
mohāt tasya parityāgas tāmasaḥ parikīrtitaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

But the action that is to be always done should not be relinquished. To relinquish that due to delusion is said to be a tamasic [delusional] act.

 #### Commentary 

The teaching of the renouncing of desires for results [of actions] does not teach the renouncing of [appropriate] action. The renouncing of such actions done by non-discerning fools under the power of delusion – that is called “tamasic tyaga.”
