 #### Bengali Translation 

There is no being on Earth or in heaven, not even amongst the gods, that is free from these three gunas born of Prakriti. 

 #### Commentary 

O Arjuna! This tree of samsara that has been imagined as having roots up above and such, that which has to be cut down with the weapon of resolute detachment – in this universe-sheath, whatever living or non-living beings that there are in whichever plane, from Bhu[-loka] and such to Satya-loka, gods such as Brahmaa, humans, even to the end of inert matter – whatever is there – all of that is born of the mutations of the types of the gunas of the guna-endowed Prakriti. There is nothing in any place or location that is free of that sattva, rajas and tamas, nor is there anything existing separate from them. If even a bit of one of the three gunas remains [in consciousness], one cannot have the attainment of withdrawing from the causalities of samsara. Know that all Vedas and Upanishads and other scriptures have the same teaching.
