ātma-vaśhyair-vidheyātmā prasādam adhigachchhati

 #### Bengali Translation 

But the one who is the unattached soul with a disciplined heart – that one is under the Power of the Self and is without like and dislike; even if that person goes about using the sense-organs – meaning: experiencing all of the things of the world – he/she attains Peace.

 #### Commentary 

In slokas 62 to 64 [of this Chapter 2], the “type” of the person has been divided into two parts. One is the worldly-matters-minded, undisciplined-hearted person, and the other is the non-desiring, disciplined-hearted person. The undisciplined one gets death, according to the progression stated in slokas 62 and 63. And the disciplined one goes according to that which is stated in sloka 64: that even while going through worldly experiences, that sadhak is without desire, and thus receives “prasad” [blessings] – meaning: witnesses the Peace-filled Supreme Substance of Vishnu. “PrasAdastu prasannatA” [may there be the blessing of Happiness].
