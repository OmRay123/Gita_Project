 #### Bengali Translation 

O Partha [Arjuna]! But the great souls who are of divine nature worship Me single-mindedly, knowing Me as the Origin and the Inexhaustible.

 #### Commentary 

“Mahat” means “primary,” and “atma” is “I”. This primary – meaning: when Mula Prakriti [the Root Prakriti] or Maya leaves everything and sits, facing “I”, yet does not merge with “I” and does not do anything to go turn [away from “I”] either – the one who stays in this state of Maya – that is the one who is “mahatma” [great soul]. This state happens through the power of sadhana, by looking towards “I” and turning the four states of mind-intellect-ego-chitta to face the other way. And if one is abiding by/in any dharma of the lower side (meaning: even the area just below the starting point of the chitta’s becoming free of actions), there is no possibility [of this state of “mahatma” happening]. This is the work of an extremely intense sadhak. Because Prakriti at this time casts off the power of giving birth and becomes beholden to Her Husband, the term “daiva Prakriti” [the Divine Prakriti] is being used. The sadhak, as well, taking recourse in Prakriti in this particular state, leaves behind the antahkarana foursome of mind and such, and meditates on “I” – meaning: the Original Cause of phenomena. Knowing that the Cause of the all-power-endowed-Prakriti’s all-powerfulness is “I knowing ‘I’,” and thereafter affirming the Inexhaustible, the sadhak tries to merge [with the Self].
