#### Prose 

बहिरन्तश्च भूतानामचरं चरमेव च |
सूक्ष्मत्वात्तदविज्ञेयं दूरस्थं चान्तिके च तत् || 16||
bahir antaśh cha bhūtānām acharaṁ charam eva cha
sūkṣhmatvāt tad avijñeyaṁ dūra-sthaṁ chāntike cha tat

 #### Bengali Translation 

It is outside of all phenomena/living beings, inside and also in the inert. It is also in the moving. Because of Its subtleness it is unknown. It is far and it is also near.

 #### Commentary 

Because this “Tat-Brahman” [That Brahman] is extremely subtle, It exists as the same within and without all phenomena/living beings. Thus, It is also within and without the moving and unmoving. Those who are visionaries of the subtle, because they abide in this subtleness, this “tat” [That] is near them. And those who only see the physical/gross [aspects] do not understand any of the meanings of these words. Therefore, It is far away from them.
