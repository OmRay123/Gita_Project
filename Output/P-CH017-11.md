अफलाकाङ्क्षिभिर्यज्ञो विधिदृष्टो य इज्यते |

aphalākāṅkṣhibhir yajño vidhi-driṣhṭo ya ijyate
yaṣhṭavyam eveti manaḥ samādhāya sa sāttvikaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

[The yajna [rite] performed] by the persons who, having no desire for results and perceiving: “the performance of the rite is itself the goal,” make mind one-pointed in this way and perform yajna according to scriptural injunctions – that is verily “sattvic yajna.”

 #### Commentary 

When, upon driving prana in the brahmanadi, everything (whatever there is by whatever name) ends – that is when there is no hankering for results. This is Brahman-yajna – meaning: offering the oblations of Maya’s causalities in the fire of Brahman. Guru’s teaching is necessary. That teaching must agree with the scriptures. “That” – as well – has to be experienced within one’s own body. The coming together of these three (happening in the same place and time) is called “scripturally directed.” Bringing the mind to oneness – meaning: the effort that is made for the Supreme Goal by merging mind [in the Self] – that is that which is called “sattvic yajna.”
