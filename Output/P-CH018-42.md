 #### Commentary 

The one who, due to purification of karma [actions bearing fruits] and samskaras [impressions in consciousness] in previous lives, spontaneously manifests within his/her inner being: serenity, forbearance, austereness, cleanliness, patience, transparency, knowledge, application of knowledge and such (which have been previously explained) – it is that person who will be accepting him/herself as brahmin. And by cultivating these, that person will attain Emancipation.
