#### Prose 

तत्र तं बुद्धिसंयोगं लभते पौर्वदेहिकम् |
यतते च ततो भूय: संसिद्धौ कुरुनन्दन || 43||
tatra taṁ buddhi-sanyogaṁ labhate paurva-dehikam
yatate cha tato bhūyaḥ sansiddhau kuru-nandana

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Kurunandana [joy of Kurus; Arjuna], at that place, that yogi gets the same consciousness as from the time of leaving the last body, and in order to continue towards the attainment of perfection, that yogi practices with great care, much more care than in the previous life.

 #### Commentary 

The level of consciousness that enabled the yogi to practice with care and attain Settledness in Brahman in the previous life – by taking birth in the household of the pure and benevolent, or by taking birth in the lineage of adept yogis, that yogi takes up from that same level of consciousness – he/she gets that very same level of consciousness [at the start of the new birth], and in this [new] life, makes the effort for realization with much greater care than in the previous life.
