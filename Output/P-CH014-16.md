कर्मण: सुकृतस्याहु: सात्त्विकं निर्मलं फलम् |
रजसस्तु फलं दु:खमज्ञानं तमस: फलम् || 16||
karmaṇaḥ sukṛitasyāhuḥ sāttvikaṁ nirmalaṁ phalam
rajasas tu phalaṁ duḥkham ajñānaṁ tamasaḥ phalam

 #### Bengali Translation 

The learned ones have said that the fruits of sattvic acts are predominated by sattva guna and are pure; the fruits of rajasic acts are of pain/sorrow; and the fruits of tamasic acts are of ignorance (delusion).

 #### Commentary 

The fruit of good (sattvic) acts is the attainment of pureness (having happiness). The fruit of rajasic acts is pain/sorrow (the quarreling between the good and bad of the plane of humans). And the fruit of tamasic acts is ignorance – meaning: the continuous current of eating, sleeping, having sex, being afraid [etc.]. This happens for the lower types of humans [down through] inert matter.
