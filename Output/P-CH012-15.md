#### Prose 

यस्मान्नोद्विजते लोको लोकान्नोद्विजते च य: |
हर्षामर्षभयोद्वेगैर्मुक्तो य: स च मे प्रिय: || 15||
yasmān nodvijate loko lokān nodvijate cha yaḥ
harṣhāmarṣha-bhayodvegair mukto yaḥ sa cha me priyaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

The one from whom “loka/s” [see commentary below] do not shrink, and, as well, one who does not shrink from the world, one who is free of mirth, indignation/hatred, fear and distress – that one is dear to Me. 

 #### Commentary 

“Loka” [beings; phenomena] means “all that is visible.” When that becomes “I”, the relationship of seer and seen disappears. Thus, there is no place for the visible to be distressed by “I”, or the visible to cause distress to “I”. In distress, there is indignation/hatred. When there is no distress, there is mirth. And when there is conflict, fear arises. The one in whom none of these exist – that is verily the one who is dear to Me – meaning: “I”.
