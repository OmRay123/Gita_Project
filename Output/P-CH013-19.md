 #### Bengali Translation 

The field, knowledge and the object of knowledge have now been stated in this summarized way. Knowing this, My devotee becomes fit to attain My State. 

 #### Commentary 

From the primal elements to the foundation is the “field.” From the qualities such as “amaanitva” [not having self-importance] to the witnessing of the goal of spiritual knowledge is “knowledge.” And from “Beginning-less ‘I’” to “residing within the hearts of all” is the “object of knowledge.” I have told you about these in summarized form. The one who is the devotee of “I” (meaning: the one who has suffered the torture of the ocean of samsara and is going to go and merge in “I” and get Emancipation) – if he/she discusses these three matters and becomes aware of the Form of “Tat,” that being will be intoxicated by the State of “I” and will get “I”.
