 #### Commentary 

“Anapeksha” [without expectation/want; see first line of sloka 12:16 above] – one who does not expect/want anyone [or anything] and remains “alone” – meaning: experiences “Kaivalya” [Only-ness] – that is the one who is “Anapeksha.” The restlessness of mind is verily that which is “ashuchi” [unclean]. Stillness is “shuchi” [clean]. Playing around with the worldly experience in the external world is that which is called “karya” [external work/action]. One who directs these [worldly experiences] with appropriate means, yet is not stained by their contact, and actually lives in Truth during that time – that being is the one who is “daksha” [adept]. “Daksha” is “Prajapati” [lord of subjects/beings]. Those who have full emergence, settledness and then destruction – those are “praja[s]” [subjects of creation]. The one who is the ruler of these “prajas” is [considered to be] “daksha” [in control]. Like the way it is when [the ruler] sits up above and no one from below can touch him/her – so it is with the yogi in samadhi. One who lifts up the antahkarana from the created world and lives as if one is up above – that is the one who is “udasina” [detached]. The one to whose antahkarana no “adhi” or “vyadhi” — Begin Footnote. — “Adhi” means “affliction of the mind.” It is resolved by meditation/contemplation. And “vyadhi” means “affliction of the body.” Through treatment of the body – meaning: through medicines, diet and such – this is resolved. — End Footnote. — can cause any kinds of troubles – that is the one who is called “gatavyatha” [without “vyatha” [pains]; see first line of above sloka]. What to say – the one whose “karma” [any work] or “karya” [active work] has no undertaking at all – that one is the one who is called “sarvarambhaparityAgi” [one who has let go of all undertakings]. The one for whom, through having immovable faith in guru’s teachings, the fruits of sadhana have ripened – that is the one who is My devotee. Thus, that is the being who is dear to Me – meaning: “I”.
