#### Prose 

सत्त्वात्सञ्जायते ज्ञानं रजसो लोभ एव च |
प्रमादमोहौ तमसो भवतोऽज्ञानमेव च || 17||
sattvāt sañjāyate jñānaṁ rajaso lobha eva cha
pramāda-mohau tamaso bhavato ’jñānam eva cha

 #### Bengali Translation 

Knowledge arises from sattva guna. Only greed arises from rajoguna. And madness and delusion arise from tamoguna. 

 #### Commentary 

The light of sattva guna makes one understand “I”. What this “I” is – to know that is that which is called “jnanaprapti” [having knowledge]. Rajoguna increases the lust to get other beings’ things in any way possible. And the tamasic state is the playground of madness, delusion and ignorance.
