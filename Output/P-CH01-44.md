उत्सन्नकुलधर्माणां मनुष्याणां जनार्दन |

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Janardan! We have heard that those people for whom the lineage-dharmas are destroyed – they are destined to live in hell.

 #### Commentary 

“JanArdana”: “jana” = birth; “ardana” = to persecute. The One Who persecutes birth – meaning: the One Who bestows Liberation – it is He Who is called “Janardan.” Here, it is Kutastha Chaitanya that is being addressed as: “O Janardan! It is heard that those who have mind-dharma – if those dharmas of the body are corrupted for them and if that [corruption] brings about the imminent death of the body, then high thinking and feeling no longer comes about for them; [then] there is no ability left even to do any kind of repentance (meaning: [no ability remaining] for accomplishing purification of the chitta through special Kriya). There is no end to their terrible pain, and because of that, their thinking becomes low-minded and the death of the body comes about.
