#### Prose 

सर्वमेतदृतं मन्ये यन्मां वदसि केशव |
न हि ते भगवन्व्यक्तिं विदुर्देवा न दानवा: || 14||
sarvam etad ṛitaṁ manye yan māṁ vadasi keśhava
na hi te bhagavan vyaktiṁ vidur devā na dānavāḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Keshava [Sri Krishna]! That which You are telling me – I believe all of that to be true. Indeed, O Bhagavan [Divine One; Sri Krishna]! Even the gods do not know Your Presence (the Cause of Manifestation), and neither do the demons.

 #### Commentary 

“Keshava” – “ka” = Brahmaa, the creator + “eesha” = the destroyer + “va” = void. When this power of creation and the power of destruction become the Void, when they merge and become One – meaning: the Permanent State that is devoid of creation and destruction – that is the state that is called “Keshava.” When, after experiencing this state, I came down – at that time, whatever it is that “He” said up above – He had me accept all of that. That “Keshava-state” – that cannot be known by anyone other than “karmis” [spiritual practitioners] (Kriya-devoted ones), regardless of being in the state of “gods” who enjoy the fruits of karma [actions and their fruits] or being the lust-bound, ignorant/stupid ones in the state of “demons.” And because all of those glories are established in You, You are “Bhagavan” [Divine One; the Lord].
