#### Prose 

मा ते व्यथा मा च विमूढभावो
दृष्ट्वा रूपं घोरमीदृङ्ममेदम् |
व्यपेतभी: प्रीतमना: पुनस्त्वं
तदेव मे रूपमिदं प्रपश्य || 49||
mā te vyathā mā cha vimūḍha-bhāvo
dṛiṣhṭvā rūpaṁ ghoram īdṛiṅ mamedam
vyapeta-bhīḥ prīta-manāḥ punas tvaṁ
tad eva me rūpam idaṁ prapaśhya

 #### Bengali Translation 

May you not be pained by seeing this terrifying Form of Mine, and may you not become confused either. Be free of fear and be happy at heart and see again That Form of Mine [previously seen before the terrifying Form]. 

 #### Commentary 

“MA te vyathA” – do not fear any more. “MA cha vimooDhabhAvah” [do not be confused] – and you no longer need to go about being under the powers of lust, anger, serenity, perseverance and such. (Losing one’s sensibilities and taking recourse in lust, anger, delusion, discrimination/discernment, detachment and any such vrittis [operations] is “vimudhatva” [confusion].) So, do you see how it is to see My intense (allconsuming) Form? Now, see that Form [from before] – that four-armed Form holding conch-shell, discus, mace/club and lotus. What you desired to see – now see it.
