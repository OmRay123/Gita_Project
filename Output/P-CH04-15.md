 #### Bengali Translation 

The deeply aspiring ones of the past have known in this very way and have performed karma [acts]. Therefore, do the karma [act] of the past (first/original) as it was practiced before by the deeply aspiring ones.

 #### Commentary 

Yes, it is true that if one knows the unbound and desire-free state of the Self, one does not have to again be bound by karma [fruits of actions], but karma [acts] cannot be abandoned just because of that. This is because there is a possibility that the person who has abandoned karma [spiritual act] will fall from the state of attainment. But the one who is a “karmi” [doer of the spiritual act], has absolutely no possibility of falling. This is why [it is said that] “karma jyAyohyakarmaNah” [action is superior to inaction]. The deeply aspiring ones of the past, those who came to know the State of the Self quite well and understood that they would never again have to be bound to karma [actions and their fruits] – even they did not abandon karma [spiritual acts]; they went on doing them according to the rules. That is why Srigurudev [Sri Krishna] is saying, “Arjuna! Do karma [spiritual act]. The way that the deeply aspiring ones of the past performed karma – you also do (the first/original) karma, in the form of pranayam, in that way.
