jñānāgni-dagdha-karmāṇaṁ tam āhuḥ paṇḍitaṁ budhāḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

One whose karmas [acts] are performed without desire – because all of those karmas [actions and their fruits] of that person are burned up in the Fire of Knowledge/Knowingness, the knowledgeable ones call that being “pandit” [wise].

 #### Commentary 

Hankering for the worldly experience is called “kama” [desire]. The craving or wish itself is actually the “sankalpa” [volition; determination to reach a goal]. It is from “sankalpa” that “kama” arises. The sankalpa that one makes in order to fulfill the wish to be Liberated – because it doesn't bring one into the bondage of karma [actions and their fruits], even though it is a desire, it cannot be called a desire. The five elements are the “sarva” [all] [see “sarve” [locative form] in the first line of the above sloka]. All of the prana-Kriyas that are done in the five elements by following the teachings of guru in order to purify the chitta – all of those are “sarva-samArambha” [undertakings of the “all”; see first line of the above sloka]. The one for whom the entirety of his/her undertakings – meaning: all of these prana-Kriyas – are devoid of “kama” and “sankalpa” - meaning: one who has no desire for revelations/powers or for the attainment of Liberation when doing Kriya, the one who, without any conflicts/obstructions, simply carries out the teachings of guru – for that person, akarma in karma and karma in akarma is seen. Thus, the Knowledge of the Self that is born in that sadhak in that state – by that, all of that sadhak's karma [actions and their fruits] gets burned up. Even if action is performed (in the eyes of people) because of societal reasons or because of reasons for the maintenance of the body [and such], those [actions] do not again take root – meaning: that sadhak cannot be wrapped up by the fruits arising from that karma [actions]. This is the sadhak that is “pandit” [wise] - “gyani” [spiritually wise]. [The state of such a “pandit” is described in slokas 20-21 [of this Chapter 4].]
