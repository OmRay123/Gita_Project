चेतसा सर्वकर्माणि मयि सन्न्यस्य मत्पर: |

buddhi-yogam upāśhritya mach-chittaḥ satataṁ bhava

 #### Bengali Translation 

Through the sense of discrimination, surrender all actions to Me, and having surrendered to Me, take recourse in “buddhi-yoga,” and keep your mind on Me.

 #### Commentary 

The 12 causalities/factors that have been previously spoken about in sloka 14 [of Chapter 18 of the Bhagavad Gita] – whatever is done in/with those causalities/factors – that is what is called “sarva karma” [all actions]. Throwing all of those karmas in the personal consciousness [the highest position in the antahkarana], cause the causalities/factors and karmas from below to not exist. The lack of causalities/factors and karma [action] is that which is called “buddhi-yoga.” After [the application of] “buddhi-yoga,” only the impressions of the aggregate of karmas [actions] remain in the field of personal consciousness. Via personal consciousness, throwing those impressions of karmas in “I” burns up the impressions of karmas. After the impressions of karmas burn up, the chitta [personal consciousness] [becomes] “Chit” [Universal Consciousness] – meaning: falls into “I” and [“chitta”] becomes “chit” [lays down flat]; [alternate translation: becomes “Chit” [capital “C”; Universal Consciousness]. That is why I am saying that you, upon simply taking recourse in “buddhi-yoga,” and after throwing all karmas with the help of chitta into “I”, and destroying them, remain in contemplation of Me [or: remain in My Consciousness] unbrokenly.
