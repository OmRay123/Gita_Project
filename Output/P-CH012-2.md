श्रद्धया परयोपेतास्ते मे युक्ततमा मता: || 2||
śhrī-bhagavān uvācha
mayy āveśhya mano ye māṁ nitya-yuktā upāsate
śhraddhayā parayopetās te me yuktatamā matāḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

[The Lord said:] “Those who submerge their minds in Me, and, being fully absorbed, worship me with great faith/reverence – they are the most devoted, according to Me.”

 #### Commentary 

Again, the sadhak is resolving his/her own questions through his/her own experience. With unmoving faith in the teachings of guru (with the firmness of strength to overcome all obstacles [to spiritual practice]), keeping “I” as the first priority, forgetting everything and throwing the mind into Me, uniting with the Eternal “I” (like well water in the water of the Ganges) – the one who comes near “I” and then merges with “I” – to Me that being is the most connected.
