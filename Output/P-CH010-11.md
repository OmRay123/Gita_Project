#### Prose 

तेषामेवानुकम्पार्थमहमज्ञानजं तम: |
नाशयाम्यात्मभावस्थो ज्ञानदीपेन भास्वता || 11||
teṣhām evānukampārtham aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ
nāśhayāmyātma-bhāva-stho jñāna-dīpena bhāsvatā

 #### Bengali Translation 

Those who meditate [upon Me] in the aforementioned way – out of compassion, I live in their beings, and by the Luminous Lamp of Knowledge/Awareness, I destroy the darkness born of ignorance.

 #### Commentary 

By the Grace of “I”, for the spiritual practitioner of this kind, the ignorance-bound mutations of Maya are destroyed. This is because that sadhak has become Still in the State of the Self, and thus the Light from the State of the Self permeates that practitioner’s inner being.
