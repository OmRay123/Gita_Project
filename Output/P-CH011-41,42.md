 #### Bengali Translation 

O Achyut [Indestructible; Vishnu; Sri Krishna]! Because of not knowing this Grandeur of Yours, and because of having erroneous perception, and because of feeling ordinary friendliness, and thinking of You as merely a friend – the way that I have addressed You, such as: “hey Krishna, hey Yadav, hey friend” etc., which I have said at times with impetuousness, and because of having fun, the way that You were sometimes treated disrespectfully [by me] in front of everyone during times of relaxation, resting, sitting or dining – I pray for Your forgiveness, O Immeasurable One. 

 #### Commentary 

O Lord, You are the Greatest of the great. Not knowing your Glory, thinking that You are someone of my own age, and falling into a usual and friendly relationship due to erroneous thinking, I addressed You with names like this: “Hey Krishna, hey Yadava, hey friend” etc., even though You are the Immeasurable. All of the things I said [to You and about You] due to being under the influence of the gunas, and the disrespect I showed You, either directly or indirectly, while resting, dining, playing etc. – O Achyuta [Indestructible One], please forgive all of those mistakes that I made.
