 #### Bengali Translation 

O Spirit of all! Salutations to Your front and back. I bow to all of Your sides/directions. You, the One with Infinite Ability and Unlimited, Boundless Might, are fully pervading the entire creation. Therefore, You are all. 

 #### Commentary 

I bow to Your east side. I bow to Your west side. Your north, south, southwest, northeast, northwest, southeast, up and down – I bow to all of Your sides. O Lord! This “sarva” [all] (creation) – it is manifesting in You and dissolving in You as well. The grandeur and potency of this “sarva” is very little – meaning: limited. And You? You are Unlimited. Like liquidity in water – You are existing in this “sarva” [all] in that way. And “sarva” is on You like water is on liquidity. So, You are Infinite. Therefore, Your Potency and Grandeur/Valor are also Infinite. O Infinity! Prostrations to You.
