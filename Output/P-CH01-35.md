api trailokya-rājyasya hetoḥ kiṁ nu mahī-kṛite

 #### Bengali Translation 

What to speak of something as small as the Earth, even if [we] get rulership of the three worlds I do not wish to kill these persons. O Janardan [Sri Krishna]! What kind of happiness will we gain by killing the persons on the side of Dhritarashtra?

 #### Commentary 

“JanArdana” = (jana [people] + arda [request] = to beg for [or: supplication] + “anaT” [suffix of function]) the One Who is supplicated by people for the purpose of attaining the Supreme Substance. [The sadhak is] using the term “Janardan” because this type of feeling is appearing in the heart of the sadhak: “O guru! Please have mercy! I cannot accept this kind of hardship. What I can do? [If there is] something by which I can both have bhoga and yoga – tell me some way like that.” (Now, the sadhak is being run by the samsaric intellect, yet at the same time, he has taken up the attitude of righteousness/spirituality and is trying to hold his/her own.
