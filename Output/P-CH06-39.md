O Krishna! Please completely destroy this doubt of mine. No one at all except You can destroy this doubt.

 #### Commentary 

Sri Krishna Himself is the Indestructible Person/Being – God. It is in Him that the Seed of Omniscience exists. He is Total/Complete. Whatever other gods, sages, saints that are present in the path of the sushumna – all of them are parts of this Totality. Thus, their omniscience is according to their station [partial]. For as long as there is no merging in this Complete Indestructible Brahman – it is for that long, verily, that the wholeness is not actually complete, and has greater or lesser proportions. In order to see the past and future just like the present, in order to destroy all doubts, one has to unite the chitta [mind/heart] with that Indestructible Brahman. It will not do to connect anywhere else. That is why the sadhak is surrendering his chitta in the Indestructible Brahman in the Form of Sri Krishna, and coming to know in slokas 40 to 44 [of this Chapter 6] about the destiny of the fallen yogis.
