#### Prose 

अनुबन्धं क्षयं हिंसामनपेक्ष्य च पौरुषम् |
मोहादारभ्यते कर्म यतत्तामसमुच्यते || 25||
anubandhaṁ kṣhayaṁ hinsām anapekṣhya cha pauruṣham
mohād ārabhyate karma yat tat tāmasam uchyate

 #### Bengali Translation 

The action that is performed under delusion, with backwards thinking regarding good or bad results, the action that is destructive, inflicts harm on others and is done by self-force, the action that is done without the concern for the whole – that is called tamasic [action]. 

 #### Commentary 

There is no idea about what kind of consequences there will be. Not knowing my capabilities, I am fasting and awakening malevolent spirits in the cremation grounds so that I can kill my enemies. There are no injunctions, no mantras (the restlessness in the form of volition and non-volition that the mind has taken on – that which removes this restlessness – that is that which is called “mantra” [that which delivers the mind/heart]; this is known through the teachings of guru). This type of work done from ignorance – this is that which is called tamasic work.
