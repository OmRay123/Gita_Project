 #### Bengali Translation 

Sanjaya said, “O Bharat [Dhritarashtra]! Upon this utterance by Arjuna, the one who is victorious over sleep, Hrishikesh [Sri Krishna] [drove] the most excellent chariot and set it in the [area in the] middle of the soldiers of the two sides – in front of Bhishma, Drona and all of the royalty [present] – and said these words: 'O Partha [Arjuna]! Look, and observe all of these [persons] from the Kurus.'”

 #### Commentary 

Upon coming back down after Kriya – as mentioned before – and having become mind-oriented [again], [the sadhak] is again witnessing through his/her inner perception. That is why it is stated, “Sanjaya said.” And being mind-oriented, [the sadhak] is thinking about him/herself. That is why [the sadhak] is in the state of “Bharat.” “BhArata”: “bha” = luminescence; light; “rati” in that [light] = addiction – the one who has [this addiction to that light] is “Bharat.” Only Consciousness is revelatory light, and Prakriti [Nature] as the twenty-four elements is non-revelatory/hiding. One who looks at the light of the Self from being under the power of Prakriti – it is he/she who is “Bharat.”
 
“GuDAkesha”: (“gudDAkA” = sleep, laziness; “eesha” = rulership) = victor over sleep. The sadhak without laziness is called “Gudakesh.” The state of non-stop establishment in Kriya is the state of “Gudakesh.” It is when one becomes victorious over sleep that one attains “achyuta” [common noun – the state of being imperturbable/indestructible]. The one who has vanquished the ignorance-filled sleep and is capable of taking refuge in the Knowledge-filled “sleep” (the samadhi-rest) is the one who is “the victor over sleep” - meaning: [the sadhak] who, instead of falling to the restlessness because of tiredness and oncoming sleep during the practice of Kriya, is able to become established in the Light-filled State. Continuously thinking about worldly matters and becoming overcome by the tiredness that is connected to that [constant thinking] is called “ajnanaja nidra” [ignorance-filled sleep] or  [simply] “nidra” [sleep]. And the waveless rest that comes about while continuously looking at the Self, when all of the movements in consciousness [vrittis] of worldly matters disappear – that is what is called “jnanaja nidra” [Knowledge-filled “sleep”], the “Sleep of abiding in the Self” or “samadhi.” In this state of being “Gudakesh,” if some types of desires come forth in the mind, the power to “work” those desires through the mental sense-faculties also comes about. That power is revealed from the Kutastha Itself. This is why “Achyuta” [proper noun – the Indestructible/Imperturbable] at that time is called “Hrishikesh” (the ruler over the aggregate of the senses). Although these states are subtle, they can be easily/naturally known by just making a little effort in the path of sadhana. When that type of desire to put oneself in the middle [of the two sides of the vrittis] (as written in the 21st sloka) comes about, through “Hrishikesh” (the power to rule over the senses), attained through the grace of guru, the sadhak takes his “most high/excellent chariot” and sets it in the middle, [the area] between the soldiers of both sides.
 
“Rathottama” [the most high/excellent chariot]: “Rath” [chariot] means that on which one can sit and travel – meaning: the place of sitting or settling [oneself]. There are three places of settling between the Muladhar[-chakra] to the Ajna-chakra: “Dang” [alternate transliteration: “daṃ”] - in the middle between the Muladhar and the Svadhisthan in the area of sexual desire; “yang” [alt: “yaṃ”] at the Anahata; and “pang” [alt: paṃ] – above the Vishuddha and below the Ajna at the mastak-granthi. (See Illustration no. 2.) Keeping the mind-form in the “da” area, there is only the knowledge of Muladhar; if it is kept in the “ya” area, Muladhar, Svadhisthan, Manipur and Ajna – the knowledge of these four chakras comes about; and if [the mind-form] is kept in the “pa” area, all of the causalities – beyond the actions of the five elements – that are related to the aggregate of the [twenty-four] subtle elements become directly evident. And more, while staying in the “pa” area, the sadhak has to be “Kapidhvaja” [see first line of the commentary on sloka 20 of Chapter 1] and the charioteer Krishna [see explanation of Krishna as “sarathi” in the third paragraph of the commentary on slokas 21, 22 and 23 of Chapter 1]. This is why, during the practice of sadhana, that “pa” area is called “rathottama” [the most excellent chariot; or: most high chariot].
 
“Ubhaya senA” [soldiers of both sides]: Pravritti (the vrittis [activities of consciousness] going towards samsara) and nivritti (the vrittis that are directed away from samsara). “Pravritti” - the world-oriented ego, or the reflected consciousness (Bhishma) and the samskarically corrupted intellect (Drona) operating the desire- and want-filled lust, anger, delusion, pride, avarice etc., and the things that support and are supported by these, such as: sleep, drowsiness, doubt, fear, laziness, dilatoriness and such group of vrittis that are obstacles against sadhana. “Nivritti” - discrimination, detachment, knowledge, devotion, reverence, serenity, self-control, forbearance, desisting from sensual desires, resolve, spiritual longing and such group of vrittis that are supportive of sadhana.
 
Even after keeping one's sight on Kutastha, receiving the Light of Consciousness directly, and claiming the most excellent/high place and setting oneself between the two – worldly-matter-directed and Self-directed – vrittis, the previously accumulated world-oriented samskaras become very subtle at this time and go in all directions. For this reason, the “me and mine” feeling becomes stronger. This “me and mine” manifests directly from the jiva's own Prakriti [Nature]. It is Prakriti that is the mother. That is why that state of the sadhak has been referred to as “Partha.” “Partha” = the son of “Pritha” [another name for Kunti who was Arjuna's mother] - meaning: the sadhak with motherly feelings. “Prath” = being famous; “a” = the sound of speech signifying “doing” - meaning: the one who is naturally [or: by oneself, automatically] famous or renowned – that is the one who is called “Pritha.” Prakriti [Nature] is Herself the Renowned One. The well-renowned ones who emerge from this Prakriti – they are the ones who are called “Partha.” (Space = Yudhishthira, air = Bhima, fire = Arjuna – this is why they are also called “Partha” - because they are revealing themselves upon manifesting their motherly characteristics.) At this time, as the sadhak is progressing according to the teachings of guru and remaining faced towards the East, he/she goes on looking at the [vrittis of the] opposition, represented by Bhishma, Drona and the whole group of the primary [world-directed] vrittis (by which [the experience of] “mahi” [can happen] - meaning: the earthly pleasures can be enjoyed). At that time, “look at all of these [persons] gathered here from the Kaurava side” - this kind of perception rises in [the sadhak's] heart.
