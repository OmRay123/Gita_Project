#### Prose 

अन्तवन्त इमे देहा नित्यस्योक्ता: शरीरिण: |
अनाशिनोऽप्रमेयस्य तस्माद्युध्यस्व भारत || 18||

 #### Bengali Translation 

It is said that all of these bodies - belonging to the Indestructible, Immeasurable and Eternal Self – are called “anitya” [impermanent; temporal] (endowed with “end”/destructible). Therefore, O Bharat [Arjuna]! Fight.

 #### Commentary 

After speaking about the subject of the macrocosm in the previous two slokas, now the subject of the body and the embodied – meaning: the microcosm – is being specifically addressed. If one wants to discuss the relationship between these two cosmos [micro and macro], it can be said thusly: as the force of wind goes across a mass of water, innumerable waves-foam-bubbles appear (the water that is only the physical form of that air and nothing else), and then after a few moments (with the wind subsiding) they disappear; the water portion goes to the water and the air portion goes to the air; the illusory vision of the rising wave is no longer there; without disturbance, things remain steady – just like that, in the macrocosm, each body appears because of the conjunction with Consciousness/Spirit, and later (with the disjunction from Consciousness/Spirit) is destroyed. The “embodied” - meaning: Consciousness/Spirit – is Eternal, Indestructible (Infinite) and without attributes; and this body, because it is a permutation of Maya, is “endowed with change” (“antavanta” [having an end] [see sloka above for the word]) and impermanent. This is a firm assertion (declared). Therefore, instead of giving into undue affection and attachment to this body, fight – meaning: engage yourself in Layayoga [the yoga of merging/dissolving] in the sadhana-battle.
