एतैर्विमुक्त: कौन्तेय तमोद्वारैस्त्रिभिर्नर: |
आचरत्यात्मन: श्रेयस्ततो याति परां गतिम् || 22||

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! In order to be free from these three doors to hell, human beings take up the practice of doing what is good (beneficent) for themselves. And then they attain the Supreme Destination.

 #### Commentary 

O Kaunteya [Arjuna; the sadhak]! By fully escaping these three – lust, anger and greed – one goes beyond Prakritic tamas [guna]. Then, upon obtaining the right to enter the sushumna [nadi], the Freely Manifesting Light of the Self is revealed. And because of practicing the yoga of the Self, one attains the best that there is – the Supreme Destination. The sadhak merges with Brahman and attains Brahman-ness. No more coming and going remain.
