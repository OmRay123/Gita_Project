 #### Bengali Translation 

Just as a mass of water enters and fills the unmoving and fixed sea – the person to whom all desires enter in a similar way – it is that one who attains Peace and does not become a “kamakami” [desirer of desires].

 #### Commentary 

The sea is always in a full state because of the waters of rivers and such, but as its condition has no diminution or expansion, its foundation is unmoving. The one who has, through shambhavi [mudra], immersed the mind into the Bindu-Ocean (this is dependent on the performance of Kriya), and has become open-hearted within, all desires come there and are completely dissolved. From this person, no kind of desire arises to flow towards worldly experiences. Therefore, it is only this type of person who attains Peace. But the one who is “kamakami” [desirer of desires]- meaning: the one who, not having been able to cast the mind into Eternity, falls into Prakritic craving, thinking that the world with its experiences is the place of peace.
