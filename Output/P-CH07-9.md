 #### Bengali Translation 

I am the purest scent in the earth-element. I am the energy in the fire-element. I am the life of all beings, and I am the austerity of the practitioners of austerity.

 #### Commentary 

The Lord's “I-ness” or the Consciousness-Power – (6) is the foundation of the earth-element in the Muladhar in the form of the source of the sense of smell. The “purest scent” is actually the tanmatra [source] of the sense of smell. It is in the non-mutated form. It is when there is mutation that the active principles begin. Then the “pureness” or the “state of being a tanmatra [source of the senses]” no longer remains. This is why the word “punya” [pure] is used. (7) At the Manipur, in the form of energy or flame, [the Lord's “I-ness”] is the foundation of the fire-element. (8) At the Anahata, [the Lord's “I-ness”] is foundation of all living beings in the form of life – meaning: the prana-vayu. And (9) at the area from the mastak granthi to the Ajna [see Introduction to the Pranab Gita], [the Lord's “I-ness”], in the form of austerity itself, is the foundation of the practitioners of austerities.
