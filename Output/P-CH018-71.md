 #### Bengali Translation 

After speaking about the fruits of teaching the [Bhagavad] Gita to a devotee of God in sloka 68 [of this Chapter 18], and the fruits of reciting/studying the Gita in sloka 70 [of this Chapter 18], in this sloka, the Lord is speaking about the fruits of hearing the Gita [being read/taught].

 #### Commentary 

If the one who has the right to hear [the Bhagavad Gita being read/taught], has faith and a mind free of doubt, and thusly hears this dialogue – that person becomes freed of sin and becomes virtuous. And with the power of this knowledge, that one cuts apart the bondage of Maya and attains the planes of goodness (the planes of the wise). “ShṛnuyAdapi” [even if only heard] – in this statement the word “api” [even if] means this: that just by hearing, if one is with faith and is without malice, one is freed from sin and attains the way of Truth. That it will bear such fruit if one understands [the Bhagavad Gita] – that goes without saying.
