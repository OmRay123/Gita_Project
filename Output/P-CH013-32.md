#### Prose 

अनादित्वान्निर्गुणत्वात्परमात्मायमव्यय: |
शरीरस्थोऽपि कौन्तेय न करोति न लिप्यते || 32||
anāditvān nirguṇatvāt paramātmāyam avyayaḥ
śharīra-stho ’pi kaunteya na karoti na lipyate

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! Because of beginning-less-ness and non-attributed-ness, this Supreme Self is Inexhaustible (the Ruler/Owner). For this reason, even while being in this body, It does nothing and is not enwrapped (by anything).

 #### Commentary 

When the State of Brahman is attained, no conflicts of the body-associated pleasures and pains come about any longer. Only the vision of oneness remains. This is because: That which the Substance of the Supreme Self is – that is Beginning-less and Attribute-less. Therefore [It is] the Ruler. And the Prakritic substance is with beginning and with attributes; therefore [it is] mutation-oriented. For this reason, no marks can be impressed upon that Ruler (like smoke in the sky). That is why it can be said that there is no way for the fences of the attribute-enjoined, beginning-enjoined Prakriti to surround this Beginning-less, Attribute-less, Inexhaustible Supreme Self.
