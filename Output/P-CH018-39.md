 #### Bengali Translation 

The happiness that deludes oneself in the beginning and in the end as well, and comes forth from sleep, laziness and confusion – that is that which is said to be tamasic [happiness].

 #### Commentary 

The happiness that makes one become lost (covers up intellect), puts one in sleep, laziness and confusion – like: I gathered up people of the same age, and took foodstuffs and went for a picnic; we made intoxicants from certain seeds and all of us consumed it; so much talking, chatting, so much laughter, so much fun – going on enjoying all this I became unconscious from the intoxication; the dogs and jackals came and ate all the food. I got up in the morning and came back with a drawn face. This kind of happiness-enjoying is called tamasic happiness.
