यस्त्वात्मरतिरेव स्यादात्मतृप्तश्च मानव: |
आत्मन्येव च सन्तुष्टस्तस्य कार्यं न विद्यते || 17||
yas tvātma-ratir eva syād ātma-tṛiptaśh cha mānavaḥ
ātmanyeva cha santuṣhṭas tasya kāryaṁ na vidyate

 #### Bengali Translation 

But the person who is absorbed in the Self, and is satisfied in the Self alone, and finds contentment in only the Self – no “karya” [work/activity] remains for that person.

 #### Commentary 

What is “karya” [work/activity]? When mind, together with the senses, goes to the worldly experiences – the kind of pranic flow that happens at that time – that is “karya” [work/activity]. And when mind leaves the worldly experience and goes towards the Self – the kind of pranic movement that flows at that time – this is “karma” [act]. The one who is “Atma-Rama” [Delighter in the Self] – meaning: the one who, being enraptured in the Knowledge of the Self, sees the entire creation as being filled with the Self, because of that person not having awareness of the worldly experience, he/she has no “karya” [work/activity]. And the word “tu” says that because that person has no awareness of differences, he/she has no need to do “anuvartan” [see sloka 3:16] of the chakras either.  — Begin Footnote. —  See Chapter 2, sloka 46. The “vijanata brahmin” [one who is based in Brahman, and master of gyana and vigyana] is the one who is “Atmarati” [absorbed in the Self], “Atmatṛpta” [satisfied in the Self] and “Atmani santuShTa” [content in the Self]. — End Footnote.
