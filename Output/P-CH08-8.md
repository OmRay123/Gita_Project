O Partha [Arjuna]! Through yogic practice, (the yogi) becomes united (concentrated/absorbed), and with heart going to nothing else and contemplating the Essence, attains the Divine Supreme Person.

 #### Commentary 

These aforementioned teachings on the purification of the person and the dissolution of Prakriti – nothing happens just by thinking about these. When – by practicing according to the teachings in Chapter 6 [of the Gita] for many days – one becomes “yukta” [united] in yoga -- Begin Footnote. -- Joining one thing with another thing is called “yoga.” “Yukta” means the same thing. It is like: when a copper alloy is melted into gold and both melt together and become one, and only gold is seen in the gold, and the copper cannot be seen at all – similarly, like copper remaining within the gold, after the merging of Purush and Mahamaya through sadhana, no manifestation of any of Maya remains for the sadhak. Being like this is called “yuktavastha” [the state of union; see different definition in the commentary to slokas 8:9-10 of the Pranab Gita under the heading “Adityavarnam.”]. -- End Footnote. -- – meaning: when mind rises from the Muladhar through the particular places via the guru-instructed Kriya, reaches Kutastha Brahman and forgets “aham mamatva” [the feeling of I and mine], when there is no awareness except “I alone Am,” and even, gradually, that “I Am by Myself” knowingness comes to an end, yet one is not unconscious, but, like mixing sugar into sugar-cane juice, there will be a Union in Full Consciousness – that is only when it can be said to be “yogayukta” [joined as One] and “ananyagami chetana” [consciousness that does not go to anything else other than the Self]. In this State, the Shadowless, Mighty Being – in the size of only the measure of a thumb, and having sixteen-thousand glories – is seen.
