 #### Bengali Translation 

O Bharat [Arjuna]! Everyone’s faith is his/her essence. The person is filled with faith. The way one’s faith is, so is that person.

 #### Commentary 

O Bharat [Arjuna; the sadhak]! The state in which the person is not able to move vayu through the guru-instructed path – in that state – the amazing discerning awareness that arises when staying in “shastra” (the moving of vayu; see commentaries in Chapter 16 of the Pranab Gita regarding “shastra”) – that also is not in that person. At that time [in that condition], because of being under the power of the gunas, there is only “shraddha” [faith/reverence] (working power). With the predominance of sattva guna there is sattvic faith; with the predominance of rajoguna there is rajasic faith. And with the predominance of tamoguna, tamasic faith manifests. The reason is: whichever of the gunas the person takes up at whichever time in the inner mind – at that time, the person’s faith is according to that particular guna [or: those particular gunas].
