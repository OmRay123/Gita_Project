 #### Bengali Translation 

O King [Dhritarashtra]! And remembering again and again that astonishing Form of the Lord (the Cosmic Form), I am greatly awed, and I am filled with joy again and again.

 #### Commentary 

Remembering again and again that “adbhoot” [ordinary meaning: astonishing; in this case: beyond “bhoot” [beings/phenomena]] (that which has never been seen in the realm of “bhoot” [beings/phenomena]) Cosmic Form, I am experiencing a kind of great amazement within my inner being. This is because I am coming to the conclusion that the “One” does not become the “many.” And because of that, I am experiencing joy again and again.
