#### Prose 

समं पश्यन्हि सर्वत्र समवस्थितमीश्वरम् |
न हिनस्त्यात्मनात्मानं ततो याति परां गतिम् || 29||
samaṁ paśhyan hi sarvatra samavasthitam īśhvaram
na hinasty ātmanātmānaṁ tato yāti parāṁ gatim

 #### Bengali Translation 

Because the person who sees the Supreme Self as abiding in the same way in everything/everywhere, and, therefore, as [that person] does not bring about his/her own destruction – for this reason, [that person] attains the Supreme Destination (Liberation).

 #### Commentary 

The Brahman, Ishvara and Parameshvara that have been spoken about under the previous slokas – there is no place for anything to have any place in them. Because this is like that, there is no place to give instruction. There is no time; [so] there is no way to reveal something called “past” or “future.” Like a sheet of luminous fire-flame, only one Substance (Brahman) is there. This Beginning-less, Infinite Light Itself is “I” Myself. What Prakritic delusion can cause conflict in this Form of Myself? And what is the nature of such delusion? Where does it exist? Staying in an unbroken way in this state of Rulership, one cannot kill/damage oneself because there is no cutting up of the True by the false – meaning: one does not have to destroy the Knowledge “I am the Supreme Self” by coming down to the knowledge “I am the individual person.” One does not have to destroy oneself. Thus, the Supreme Goal (Settledness in Brahman) becomes established automatically.
