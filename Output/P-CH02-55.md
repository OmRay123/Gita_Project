 #### Bengali Translation 

The Lord said, “O Partha [Arjuna]! When the yogi has abandoned all of the deep rooted desires of the mind, and becomes settled and satisfied simply in his/her own self – that is when that person is called “sthitaprajna.”

 #### Commentary 

After enjoying the state of yoga, when the mind comes down [to carry out daily life], it remains in the field of the Self; it no longer descends to the lower levels. As the world is then filled with the Self, one remains as oneself in Oneself. No corrupt desires of worldly enjoyment at all can reach that place. When this state is attained, that is called “sthitaprajna.”
