 #### Bengali Translation 

O Partha [Arjuna]! But one must renounce the association to, as well as the fruits of, all of these karmas [aforementioned acts that should not be renounced]. This is My certain and best view [on this matter].

 #### Commentary 

Just as all of the legs of an elephant find their places in the circumference of the leg-area of the elephant – similarly, via the moving of vayu in the one path of Brahman, all karmas [actions] of yajna, charity and austerities are accomplished. However, because no association – meaning: no contact with the desire-form of Maya – remains, one does not become enwrapped in the fruits of [the aforementioned] actions. That is why it is being said that doing yajna, charity, austerities, karma [yogic act] while relinquishing association (the desire for the fruits of actions) [with them] is one’s absolute duty. O Partha [Arjuna; the sadhak]! This is My best view [on this matter]. (Chapter 2, slokas, 45, 49; Chapter 3, sloka 9; Chapter 5, sloka 10; Chapter 9, slokas, 20, 21.)
