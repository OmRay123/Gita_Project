Tell me how You are present with all of these manifestations throughout all of the planes. Tell me about all of Your manifestations, completely.

 #### Commentary 

That state of Kaivalya [Only-ness] that is there up above – that state that pervades the Cosmos, all phenomena and souls – anything about this cannot be spoken about after coming down [from there]. Yet, the continuous intoxication of the “I”-State does not go away either. In this kind of state, there is a time that one forgets the merging of the limited into the Unlimited. And because of the power of previous impressions, it is as if spontaneously (helplessly) a “You” forms in the “I”. That is what forces the sadhak to say, “That sky-covering Glory that is You – the fact that You have dressed up everything in creation as different ‘you’s’ – and at the same time, You are present in all of it – tell me about all of that without exception. Don’t leave anything out!” This means: the sadhak prepares him/herself to compare the states of everything outside to the sadhak’s own inner states and destroy all doubts.
