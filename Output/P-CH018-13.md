 #### Commentary 

O mighty-armed one [Arjuna]! The scripture that brings about the dawning of the Knowledge of the Self through renunciation and thereby destroying [the influence of] all the elements – that is called “Sankhya.” And the scripture that makes one understand the impermanence of the entire creation and the permanence of the Self through these methods: knowing matters of non-knowledge, the covering up of spirituality, and incongruities in concepts – that is that which is called “kritanta” or “Vedanta.”

The scripture by which the matters of knowledge can be accounted, [can be] ascertained – that is called “Sankhya” [analyzed; accounted] – meaning: “Vedanta” [the culmination, or end of knowledge]. “Kritanta” [the end of doing] – this is a specialty of Sankhya itself! “Krita” means “karma” [work]. That in which such work comes to its end (completion) – that is called “kritanta” [end of work], “karmanta” [end of karma [action]], or “Vedanta siddhanta” [goal of Vedanta]. In this, when, through statements such as “yavAnartha udpAne” [a simile using bodies of water, stated in 2:46 of the Bhagavad Gita], “sarvaṃ karmAkhilaṃ pArtha jnAne parisamapyate” [all rites eventually culminate in knowledge], there is Self-Knowledge, the ending of all karmas [actions and rites] that happen – that is being shown. And there are five causalities/factors that bring the end of all karmas so that there can be the attaining of that Self-Knowledge. Knowing those five causalities/factors is required. That is what the Lord is explaining in the very next sloka [18:14 of the Bhagavad Gita].
