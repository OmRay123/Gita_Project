#### Prose 

अश्रद्दधाना: पुरुषा धर्मस्यास्य परन्तप |
अप्राप्य मां निवर्तन्ते मृत्युसंसारवर्त्मनि || 3||
aśhraddadhānāḥ puruṣhā dharmasyāsya parantapa
aprāpya māṁ nivartante mṛityu-samsāra-vartmani

 #### Bengali Translation 

O Parantapa [Arjuna]! Persons who do not have faith in this Dharma [see commentary to 9:2 [above] of the Pranab Gita regarding the particular meaning of the word “Dharma” as used here] do not attain Me, and they continue on in the path of samsara and transmigration [death and rebirth].

 #### Commentary 

Carrying out guru’s directives in an unimpeded manner is called “shraddha” [faith/reverence]. That great power, destroying all obstacles and problems that are in the way of carrying out guru’s teachings – that indeed is “shraddha.” The one in whom this great power is lacking – that is the person who is “ashraddadhan” [irreverential; unfaithful] or “kapurush” [person with no resolve]. This “kapurush” cannot abide in the previously-mentioned state of being a “witness,” or, is one who cannot have abidance in Dharma, and thereby, cannot see the play of Prakriti taking place. Therefore, [that kind of person,] not being able to attain “I” – meaning: Settledness in Brahman – comes to the road of samsara and death – meaning: goes on to experience birth and death [repeatedly].
