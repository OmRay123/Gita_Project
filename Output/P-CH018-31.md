 #### Bengali Translation 

O Partha [Arjuna]! That by which dharma and non-dharma and karya [see commentary to 18:30 above] and akarya [see commentary to 18:30 above] are known incorrectly – that is indeed rajasic intellect.

 #### Commentary 

O Partha [Arjuna; the sadhak]! Dharma (see Chapter 9, sloka 2 [of the Bhagavad Gita]. “Adharma” [non-dharma] – the opposite of that [dharma]. Karya and akarya (see previous sloka [18:30]). [That which] brings delusion when one goes to understand the truth about all of these, [that which] makes one doubt (the non-believing intellect) – know that this kind of intellect is rajasic intellect.
