दिवि सूर्यसहस्रस्य भवेद्युगपदुत्थिता |
यदि भा: सदृशी सा स्याद्भासस्तस्य महात्मन: || 12||
divi sūrya-sahasrasya bhaved yugapad utthitā
yadi bhāḥ sadṛiśhī sā syād bhāsas tasya mahātmanaḥ

 #### Bengali Translation 

If the radiance of a thousand suns together at one time were seen in the sky, then perhaps that splendor would resemble the Brilliance of that Great Spirit. 

 #### Commentary 

The Light of the Universal Form is so powerful and is so much that It has no end. If an infinite number of suns rose at once and shone together – the combined brilliance from those suns – it would lose to the Brilliance of this Light. There is no comparison! No comparison!
