   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Commentary:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The two fundamental aspects which compose this Cosmos, by which the Cosmos exists, comprise the subject that is being elucidated in this sloka.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Now, discussing how this matter has been analyzed in philosophical treatises will make it possible to clearly understand this subject; for this reason, those analyses are being explained below in a condensed form.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">In the philosophical and scientific treatises of this country and the West, it has been concluded that this Cosmos with its innumerable solar systems has been created by two fundamental substances.  One is material-substance (matter), and the other is Consciousness-Substance (Spirit).  Brahman-Consciousness (God the Father), or the part/piece of Brahman-Consciousness (Son), or Its Cosmos-revealing Kutasthachaitanya (the Holy Ghost), is the Eternal Substance beyond and before creation (ever existing).  Brahman-Consciousness, or Its part - jiva, or Its revelatory aspect - Kutasthachaitanya (God, Son, and Holy Ghost) - these three substances are not different things; they are one thing only; and, the fundamental causes of creation - matter and Consciousness (matter and Spirit) - these two are also not separate things from That; they are only Its two Prakriti-aspects, or Its Shakti.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Although this material-Prakriti (matter) is not able to do the work of creation completely on its own, because of its proximity to Param Purush, like iron in the proximity of a magnet, it becomes imbued with Consciousness (spirited) and is transformed into a new type of substance.  This new substance is that which is the primary cause of creation - known as “mahat tattva.”  For this reason, the saintly scriptural scholars refer to this as “mahattattva.”  As in Samkhyadarshan - </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">“sattvarajastamasam samyavastham prakritiprakritermahan” etc. - no. 59 “tat sannidhanadadhishthatritvam manivat” -  no. 94  ity vishayadhayah</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Material-Prakriti itself, having been imbued with Consciousness and transformed into the form of mahattattva, moves towards Consciousness as iron in the proximity of a magnet, and in the process of transforming into Consciousness, an effort-quality or energetic quality arises. The saintly scriptural scholars call this energy/effort-endowed part of the mahattattva “buddhi” [loosely - intellect]. Its function is dharma. That which is known as “dharma” while residing in the state of the revelation of Consciousness-Self has been explained in the commentary to the fifth sloka of the fourth chapter of this book. It is with the help of this energetic-quality-endowed part of mahattattva - the action of the buddhi - that the revelation of Consciousness, meaning Kaivalyapada, is attained. Because of the solidifying of the previous samskaras [inclinations or impressions] of this very mahattattva, the other parts become somewhat colored and become transformed to work counter to that [the actions of buddhi], meaning “adharma” [not-dharma], which becomes the manifestation of the many types of created forms of things. It is this contrary functioning part that the saintly scriptural scholars call “mana” [loosely - mind]. In this way, the same Consciousness-imbued material-Prakriti, or mahattattva, is itself referred to by the two names of “buddhi” when enjoined with the effort-energetic quality, which is dharmic or holy, and when solidified and colored as “mana,” which is non-dharmic or the created form. As in Samkhyadarshan -</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">“adhyavasayo buddhih” - no. 13 “tatkaryam dharmah” - no. 14 “mahaduparagadviparitam” - no. 15 - ity pradhana karyadhyayah “mahadadyam karyam tanmanah” - no. 69 - ity vishayadhyayah</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When material-Prakriti becomes imbued with Consciousness and is thus transformed into the aforementioned form of mahattattva, a type of self-consciousness - “I am a separate thing” - arises. The saintly scriptural scholars call this extreme type of self-conscious vanity or such transformation of material-Prakriti as “ahamkar.” As in Samkhyadarshan -</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">“charamohamkarah” - no. 70 - ity vishayadhyayah “abhimanohhamkarah” - no. 16 - ity pradhana karyadhyah</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Translator’s note: In the next paragraph, as well as throughout the body of the book, there are differently written variations of the gunas commonly written as “rajas” and “tamas” and their extensions such as “rajaguna” or “rajoguna.” These variations have been transliterated as they have appeared in their various forms, including their expressions as multiple words or as one compound word.]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">In this way, from a state in which the three gunas are in a neutralized* condition, Prakriti becomes polarized,* and transformed into the dharmic- and non-dharmic-elements-embodying ahamkar, and because of this, sattva (neuter), raja (positive) and tamah (negative) - these three gunas arise; and this rajoguna is endowed with the capacity of action and is mixed with sattva and tama gunas. In this way, the one polarized Prakriti, transformed into the dharmic- and non-dharmic-elements-embodying form of ahamkar, is imbued with sattva, rajasic sattva, raja, rajasictama and tama, and because of the imbuing by these five types of gunas, the saintly scriptural scholars refer to each guna-embodying part with individual and separate names; meaning: the tamaguna-embodying part is called “kshiti” or “bhumi” [earth]; the rajasic tamaguna-embodying part is “ap” [water or liquid]; the rajaguna-embodying part is called “teja” or “anel” [energy/fire]; the rajasic sattvaguna-embodying part is called “marut” [air]; and the sattvaguna-embodying part is called “vyom,” “akash” or “kha” [ether or space]. They have delineated [these parts] by these five names. In Vedantadarshan, these have been expressed as the five elements.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[*Translator’s note: The words “neutralized” and “polarized” are in English in the original, but are enclosed in parentheses, indicating them to be definitions of their Bengali counterparts. The parenthetical occurrences - ( ) - in the previous paragraph of this translation are in the original and the words within them are in English in the original. The bracketed words in the previous paragraph - [ ] - are the translator’s, and they are explanations of the Sanskrit words appearing before them.]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This Universe is built from this permutation of ahamkar, or the five elements which have themselves been converted into the five subtle elements. Beyond the aggregate of the five sattvic parts of these five subtle elements is the eleventh sense - mind; and everyone’s five sattvaguna parts spawn the five organs of perception, and the five rajoguna parts create the five organs of action; and in everyone, the five tamaguna parts create the five matters, or just the five working in five ways with each other, manifesting as the physical elements in the form of that which can be partaken of for the purpose of the aforementioned eleventh sense’s partaking, and thus, these [together] make up the construction of the Cosmos in its many different forms. As in -</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">In this way, from the state of the neutralized condition of the three gunas, the one material-Prakriti itself, having become enjoined with Consciousness, is endowed with an effort/energy quality by which it becomes the dharmic “buddhi,” then the manifestation-oriented [adharmic] “mana,” and thereafter the combination dharma and adharma - “ahamkar”; and due to the permutation of the three gunas mentioned, and the active capacity of the energy of rajoguna, “kshiti” [earth or solid], “ap” [water or liquid], “teja” [fire or heat], “marut” [air or gaseous] and “vyom” [ether or space] - these eight forms [including “buddhi,” “mana,” and “ahamkar”] are imbued with the gunas, and by their manifested work has this world-Brahmanda been constructed. But it is because of the presence of the aforementioned Consciousness-Power [Chaitanyashakti] that all of creation, even atomic particles, are alive, and thus continue to properly sustain this Universe. A momentary lack of this Chaitanyashakti results in all atomic particles in the world-Brahmanda to become devoid of power, whereupon this vast Brahmanda contracts and the Cosmos becomes completely non-existent. Therefore, this infinite Cosmos with Brahmanda has only been constructed by the previously-mentioned permutation of the physical-Shakti enjoined with the eight qualities, but it is existing in living form upon having taken recourse in this Consciousness-Power. The way that Maharshi Vyasdev has expressed the above-mentioned spiritual essence in these two slokas is being explained below.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Earth, water, fire, air, and space, and mana [mind], buddhi [intellect] and ahamkar [ego] - these eight-essence-enjoined material-Prakriti, by whose permutated substance this world-Brahmanda is comprised - that is only a small physical-Shakti of Infinite Consciousness; but there is another Consciousness-Power - Chaitanyashakti - because of taking recourse in which this Cosmos is existing in a living form - that is what is known as the Supreme Power of the Universe-pervading Infinite Consciousness. - 4 and 5-</span> </p>

Therefore, nothing in this Cosmos is greater than this all-pervading Infinite Consciousness. Like jewels strung to thread, this immense Cosmos with Brahmanda is existing because of the Presence of that Infinite Consciousness. - 6 and 7-</span> </p>

This Kutasthachaitanya is present as the life-force in all living creatures, as austerity in the ascetic with the capacity to withstand cold, heat, conflict etc., as wisdom in the intelligent, as brilliance in the brilliant ones, and even as the Cause of the reemergence of this Cosmos after its dissolution - even in that, It Is. - 8, 9 and 10-</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">In this way, when the minds of jivas, to obtain the fruits of each one’s own desire, wish to manifest some senses-ruled bodily joy, or wish to manifest happiness through devotion to some part of Consciousness, meaning - when the mind’s sattvic condition (neutralized state) is transformed and becomes active (polarized) with a guna such as rajas, by Kutasthachaitanya, the proper reverence appears in jivas’ minds, and upon having the enjoyment of that miniscule part of Consciousness, jivas are bestowed capability. In this way, having obtained some capability from Kutasthachaitanya, the rich rewards that jivas receive from having executed such work are also for the purpose of satisfying jivas’ minds, meaning - for the purpose of establishing the mind again in its natural state, and such happens also by Kutasthachaitanya. The extensive description of this appears in the commentary to the 70th sloka of the second chapter of this book. - 21 and 22-</span> </p>

But the desireless sadhakas established in Atman-Consciousness, because of the revelation of the Eternal, Bliss-of-Knowledge-filled Infinite Consciousness, harmoniously fulfill the totality of all joys of all senses of the body and other demi-god consciousnesses situated in other areas, and reside eternally in Endless Bliss; there is no possibility that remains of destroying this Bliss. -23-</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">SUMMARIZED DESCRIPTION OF CHAPTER 7</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If mind is absorbed in Kutashta in the previously mentioned way, it is known that there are very few people in the world who take care to attain the revelation of Consciousness-Self; rarely is there one who is able to do that. How that person comes to know that Glorious Infinite Consciousness and thereby becomes aware of all things in the Universe is being explained [1-3]. Creation, samsara - all - having been constructed by a small, material-Prakriti aspect - these eight types of essences: earth, water, fire, air, ether, mana, buddhi and ahamkar - of that Infinite Consciousness, are existing as alive because of being imbued with another Supremely High Prakriti of Consciousness. Both of these Prakritis have emerged from that Infinite Consciousness, and they also dissolve in That; there is nothing greater in the Cosmos beyond That; like jewels strung on thread, this Cosmos is existing on That [4-7]. This Kutasthachaitanya makes all physical elements appear in creation. It is present in that as sound, as radiance in the presiding lords of the subtle world, such as the sun and moon, as life in living creatures, as might in the mighty, as the wish for jivas to create bodies, meaning the life-force, as the humanhood in human beings, and as OM, the revealer of Self-Knowledge; even at the culmination of dissolution, it is That who exists as the Seed for the reemergence of the Cosmos. This cause of creation, preservation and dissolution - the sattva, raja and tamagunas - is also emanating from Kutasthachaitanya, but It is gracefully residing as Eternal and Immutable [8-12]. Ignorant human beings, being entranced by the Mayic three gunas, remain bound, with demonic nature, in the experience of ego-self-consciousness. Even though this three-guna-filled Maya is difficult to traverse, by the performance of Sadguru-initiated Kriya, it can be easily crossed [13-15]. The sick, those who crave material enjoyments, the seekers of Truth and the wise - these four types of human beings are of the highest; they take up the path of Consciousness. Among them, the wise ones are the highest of all; this type of birth is priceless in this world. After many lifetimes of accumulating good samskaras, by always remaining absorbed in Consciousness-Self with complete love and devotion, they easily attain the realization of Infinite Consciousness [16-19]. Being infatuated with each one’s own samskara-bound desires and in order to fulfill them, jivas accomplish the very temporal enjoyment of bodily pleasure ruled by some sense, or some other small part of Consciousness through reverence to ego-self-consciousness, and because of that, they experience the joy of that. In that, the inner power of the body becomes scattered and soon, one has to be immersed in the ocean of sorrow. But, upon the revelation of Atman-Consciousness, all enjoyment of the body, senses and all parts of Consciousness are fulfilled in their totality, and the Bliss of Knowledge manifests as Eternal and Endless [20-23]. Being with a body made by the Maya-united created-substances, human beings become stupefied by the favorable and unfavorable matters - like and dislike - concerning that body, and because of that, unable to experience that Immutable Infinite Consciousness upon which all elements of the present, past and future appear and disappear, they deem it to be unmanifested and manifested [24-27]. Those Kriyavan sadhakas whose Consciousness-covering veil has been torn off - they, in order to be liberated from the sufferings of samsara such as old age, death, etc., take refuge in Atman-Consciousness with one-pointed and fully engrossed mind, and going above the physical aspect, the subtle aspect, and yajna, they come to know that Brahman-Consciousness, all spiritual things, and all the workings of the Cosmos by meditating upon them, and thus they discard their bodies while being merged in the Eternal, Bliss of Knowledge [28-30].</span> </p>
