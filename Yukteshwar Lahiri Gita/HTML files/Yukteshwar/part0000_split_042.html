   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Commentary:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">What are the aspects of Kriya yoga in these four slokas?  How does one practice them, and in what ways can one be careful about the obstacles associated with these?  These have been subtly indicated here.  Thus:  what is known is yoga; what are known as its aspects; and which are its obstacles as well as how can one save oneself from those obstacles - understanding all of these makes it easier to clearly comprehend these slokas.  For that reason, before explaining these sllokas, I present below in a condensed manner what is written about those subjects in the supremely high yogic treatise, Patanjal Yogasutra, as well as in other primary and important scriptures.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Shiksha, Kalpa, Vyakarana, Nirukta, Cchanda, Jyotish - having studied these six Vedic aspects and thereby having become prepared to recite the Vedas, when one analyzes the profound statements made in them such as “tattvamasi,” “sohham,” “ekamevadvitiyam,” “sarvakhalvidam brahman” etc., one comes to know that, just as the one water element in the creation, meaning liquid substances, by being mixed with complementary qualities mutate and appear as oil and many such types of substances, in the same way, only the one Brahman-Consciousness, meaning Paramatman, mutates through Maya and appears as this whole creation with its beings that are of the land, of the air, of the water etc. along with streams and rivers, oceans, mountains etc. - as this infinite Universe.  And just the same as when those oil-like substances mix with water, instead of permeating the water remain separate, similarly the Maya-enjoined creation-substances are always in the Infinite Brahman-Consciousness, although mixed with It, they cannot permeate the entire Universe, and thus, discerning themselves to be a tiny part of creation, they remain as separate things in creation.  Just as by applying some appropriate method to medicine such as liquor potass, or other such substance, the compound liquid can be broken up and immediately it will permeate all of the water, similarly, if by some technique, among all things in this infinite Universe, the fluctuations of consciousness is stopped and the influence of Maya is destroyed, then, mixing with this Infinite Consciousness, one pervades the entire Cosmos, becoming omniscient and omnipotent, and attaining Kaivalya or Brahman.  In this way, the cessation of Maya-caused fluctuations of consciousness, meaning ordinary actions, like the union of the oil-like substance with water like liquor potass etc, is for the union of all things in the Universe with that Infinite Consciousness, meaning the reason for yoga, which is why the great scriptural saints call the cessation of the fluctuations in consciousness “yoga” [union], and the techniques/methods that one needs to apply to stop those fluctuations in consciousness are called the “anga” - body, limbs or parts - of yoga.  As in -</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Although the above-mentioned limbs or parts of yoga to be practiced in order to stop the fluctuations in consciousness are of many types, in the Patanjal philosophical treatises those have been divided into eight parts and given these eight names: yama, niyama, asana, pranayam, pratyahar, dharana, dhyan and samadhi.  Among these, the last - dharana, dhyan and samadhi - having nothing to do with external sadhana, are called internal parts.  As in -</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Now, I present below the manner in which the above-mentioned parts of yoga are written about in the book named “Yogasutra” by Maharshi Patanjal:</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Renouncing envy, greed, taking things of others and such things that cause mental restlessness, being on the path of truth in chastity, and thereby extinguishing the perturbations in consciousness is called “yama.”  By this method, all destructive tendencies are eradicated.  This matter has been explained in the fourth, fifth and sixth slokas of the first chapter of this book.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If, after experiencing Consciousness-Self, the human consciousness is unable to attain the Bliss of Atman, then, as the joys of bhoga are now scattered about, it adopts many types of tendencies.  This condition produces physical ailments, “styan” - meaning mental problems, confusion/doubt - meaning the inability to discern between good and bad, inadvertence - meaning the non-caring aloofness of mind and the lack of enthusiasm, laziness - meaning the lack of activity, incessant worry over this or that happening, envisioning imaginary things - meaning delusion, a scenario of not being able to attain - meaning a type of insufferable condition that says “something seems to be obviously available but I can’t seem to get it,” unsettledness - meaning the lack of stability - many types of sufferings such as these become present.  In the book named “Yogasutra” by Maharshi Patanjal, these have been called obstacles, meaning impediments.  It is also written in the aforementioned book that the threefold suffering - meaning the physical suffering caused by the shock or attack from humans or animals or some other physical thing, the suffering of the subtle level caused by the corruption of the subtle body due to lapse in proper discipline, and spiritual suffering associated with the experience of [not fully attaining] the Bliss of Atman - causes depression, meaning despondency associated with unfulfilled desire, “angamejayatva,” meaning the shakiness of body and limb, along with inhalation and exhalation, and by these things the human consciousness remains in a disturbed state.  Thus, to eradicate all of these, one should practice “ektattva” [one unified thing].  As in - </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Now, what is this which is called “ektattva,” and how one can practice it, is being explained.  To speak about this, first it is necessary to speak about the nature of mind, meaning its character.  By nature, the mind cannot just reside in a condition of emptiness without holding on to something, and it loves bliss so much that it does not hold on to anything that does not give it any joy.  If for some reason it has to hold on to such a thing, that is for only a short while.  As quickly as it can, it will abandon it and run after another thing that will be joyful.  Knowing these two characteristics, it can clearly understood that if it is possible to keep the mind happy in something, something from which there can be no fear of unhappiness, then it remains in that thing in bliss, and no longer does it try to go after other things.  As soon as the mind is no longer restlessly going from one thing to another thing, and is steadily holding on to one thing by which it is happily residing, ektattva is being practiced.  For the practice of this ektattva, two slokas about keeping the mind happy and five slokas about keeping the mind steadfast - these seven sutras are written in the Patanjal philosophical treatises.  As in - </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">maitrikarunamuditopekshanam sukhaduhkhapunyapunyavishayanambhavanashchittaprasadanam -  Samadhipada - no. 33 </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The human consciousness of the jiva is happy at merriment in pleasure, pathos in sorrow, enthusiasm for beneficent work, and rejection of maleficent work, but these external joys remain only for a very short time.  The reason for this is that because of being attached to previous samskaras [acquired tendencies],  the consciousness, immediately afterwards, again gradually becomes unhappy.  Therefore, in order to make the happiness just mentioned long-lasting, one must practice a kriya [technique/work] that purifies samskaras and creates inner happiness.  When, by Sadguru’s instructions, the flinging out, meaning shooting out, of prana-air, and again its drawing back, meaning attraction - by the Kriya of this rechak and purak, there is samskara-purification, and happiness remains for a long time.  This subjectt has been explained in the eighth sloka of the fourth chapter.  These sutras teach on the way of keeping the mind happy, while the latter five slokas teach on how to keep the mind from going after things and thereby cast off restlessness, and thus remain in steadfastness.  As in - </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Keeping the mind happy by the above-mentioned type of technique, the all-pervading Sound of Space, the touch of the prana-air within, the sight of the inexhaustible Light, the Nectarous Ambrosia flowing from the Sahasrara, inner divine scent etc. - when any such type of inner experience arises in consciousness, the mind no longer goes after external things and remains steadily in that.  Among these, one of the highest methods is this:  coming to the place of ahamkara through the door of sushumna by Sadguru’s instruction, here one experiences:  from the plane of the sun - an incredibly powerful, and from the plane of the moon - an incredibly lovely, and together - a Light of such sublime beauty that experiencing it casts away all types of suffering and grief from the mind.  For this reason, this has been called by great saints as “vishokajyoti” [the Light that ends grief].  If this vishokajyoti is revealed and consciousness is surrendered in it, then the mind becomes completely steadfast and still. Having explained in these two sutras [Samadhipada - no. 35 and 36] about the method by which the mind can be tied to a certain thing and thereby gain steadiness, it is being instructed in the next two sutras [Samadhipada - no. 37 and 38] on how one can disengage the mind from things and keep it still.  By determining between imperishable and perishable things and allowing non-attachment to arise in relation to things of sound, touch, sight, taste, smell etc., and disengaging the mind from all those things, the mind naturally becomes still by itself.  The way to make this condition more permanent is this:  by the aforementioned technique received from Sadguru, the mind becomes happy and wisdom is established revealing: “there is no existence of anything in this Universe other than Infinite Consciousness, but because jivas are covered in ignorance and are living as if asleep, it is being imagined that there are many kinds of things that have subsistence and are being experienced.”  Realizing this experience with certainty, the mind becomes unwaveringly still.  Having instructed these four sutras to the Sadguru-graced sadhakas, in the fifth sutra [Samadhipada - no. 39], teaching is being given on what to do to attain stillness of mind in sadhana if it is not possible to acquire the grace of Sadguru or the aforementioned method.  If one is not successful at being able to have the aforementioned type of technique, then enjoining the mind’s focus on any one thing which can deemed appropriate according to one’s country, time and personal condition will also make the mind still.  In this way, stilling the mind by some method and practicing keeping it in equipoise is called “practicing ektattva” in yogic scriptures.  It has been expressed as “doing sadhana with a unified mind” in the Srimad Bhagavad Gita. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Now, if one reads these four slokas [Gita 6:11 through 6:14] intently, it can be clearly understood that He has instructed to practice all of the aforementioned parts of yoga altogether at the same time in the manner of ektattva which is antidote to the obstacles to yoga.  The aforementioned four slokas are being explained below. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">By practicing ektattva, the counteraction to the obstacles to yoga - such as physical and mental problems, confusion etc. - unifying the mind, renouncing envy, fear etc., eliminating restlessness of mind through chastity, devoting oneself to God with a tranquil mind, disciplining oneself in cleanliness and such other niyamas, seating oneself in a sanctified place on a seat which has kusha grass as its base, on top of which there is skin of deer or such animal, and on top of which there is some good quality cloth, sitting not too high and not too low, using a method of sitting that will keep the body, head and neck without movement and balanced as well as in comfort, withdrawing sight from all sides and putting it at the root of the nose, extinguishing all restlessness of the senses, preparing the mind for concentration by purifying oneself, practicing the yogic technique of pranayam for the elimination of ignorance which covers Consciousness, concentrating the mind in Kutasthachaitanya and intently remaining enjoined in Its meditation, consciousness becomes one with It.  When by this type of absorption wisdom is realized, sadhakas experience the Consciousness-Self as the Supreme Being, and live in Total Awakenedness united with that Atman-Consciousness. - 11, 12, 13 and 14- </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It is necessary to clearly explain the matters of practice [abhyas] and non-attachment [vairagya] which are mentioned in this sloka, because these two are the primary aspects of yogic methods, or it can be said that all yogic methods are only the body and limbs of these two. Therefore, some of what has been said about these two subjects by the most esteemed sages is being explained below.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Maharshi Patanjali has written about this subject in the book named “Yogasutra” in this way: that just as when a certain type of substance is mixed with a different type of substance, a change occurs in the natural condition of the original substance and thereby that substance transforms to a mutated state, in the same way, when consciousness mingles with external matters of sound, touch, sight, taste and sound etc., it becomes attached to them and a change of its natural condition occurs, because of which it then exists in a distorted condition. Thus, if it is not able to abstain from all those things, consciousness can never reside in its natural state.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If consciousness is able to abstain from things in order to remain in its natural state, then gradually, four states of being, one after another, arise in consciousness. First, by discerning the transitory nature of things and becoming aware of its own corrupted condition, an effortful state emerges within consciousness, with consciousness wanting to attain its natural state of being. The scriptural saints call this effortful condition the “yataman avastha” of consciousness. After this, consciousness gradually continues to discard the causes of its distortions. This type condition of consciousness in the scriptures is called “vyatirek avastha.” Then, the distorted conditions in consciousness that still occur because of attachment to previous tendencies [samskaras] from time to time even after having eradicated all causes [of corruption] are brought into awareness, and the state attained by consciousness from wanting to achieve peace from that is called in the scriptures as “ekindriyavastha.” After that, when all distortions and even their samskaras are eliminated, a type of peaceful state of being is obtained where any types of matters relating to visible things or supernatural intimations - no kinds of desires for anything can arise. Always, consciousness remains in its natural state. This is what the scripturral saints have called as the “vashikar avastha” of consciousness. Maharshi Patanjali has called this vashikar avastha as having the same meaning as “vairagya” [non-attachment]. As in -</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Just as when many children recite loudly and in unison, the recitations of those whose voices are more physically strong are able to be heard, and those whose voices are subtle, meaning mellow, are not able to be heard at all, in the same way, because mind experiences many types of physical things and remains engaged in their momentary and miniscule happiness, it is unable to experience that extremely subtle and internal, Eternal Knowledge and Bliss.  Thus, not attaining purity because of the mind totally being in the experience of happiness from all kinds of material and physical things, that extremely subtle, Infinite Knowledge and Consciousness-Self in the Form of Bliss is not experienced.  Therefore, not being immersed in the corruption-causing external things and remaining in its natural state, consciousness is able to experience that infinite and eternal knowledge and the Consciousness-Self in the Form of Bliss.  In this way, practicing residing in the state of that Eternal and Infinite Form of Knowledge-Bliss of the Atman-Consciousness is what is referred to in the Patanjal Yoga Sutra as “abhyas” [practice].  As in -</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">“tatra sthitau yatnohabhyasah” -  Samadhipada - no. 13</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">In this way, experiencing Atman-Consciousness, and continuously practicing residing in the Bliss of Self-Knowledge, the desire for happiness connected with the enjoyment of physical things is gradually eliminated, and consciousness resides in a state of “vashikar” [independent/sovereign], which is the emergence of what is synonymously known as vairagya [non-attachment].  And if one can become devoid of the desire for happiness connected with the enjoyment of physical things, meaning if the aforementioned state of “vashikar”, or the emergence of what is synonymously known as vairagya, occurs, then that Infinite Consciousness is experienced.  Thus, without the practice of experiencing Atman-Consciousness for a while, the emergence of vairagya is impossible, and without such vairagya, the experience of Atman-Consciousness is also impossible; therefore, both are unattainable.   To resolve this unattainable condition it is essential to take refuge in the Lotus Feet of Sadguru.  With regular and disciplined practice of their directives, as instructed in the 10th through the 14th slokas of this chapter, and engaging in the performance of yogakriya, in the state at the end of Kriya, more or less, little by little, Atman-Consciousness is experienced for moments at a time.  In this way, experiencing Atman-Consciousness, mind attains stillness in the Bliss of Self-Knowledge.   When mind is filled with the Bliss of Atman in such moments, it recognizes the momentary enjoyment of happiness connected with physical things as extremely trivial.  If one can practice this experience of Atman-Consciousness ceaselessly for a long time while being fully disciplined, chaste, reverent, devoted and doing good works with non-attachment, then the state of the Bliss of Self-Knowledge becomes eternally present.  Maharshi Patanjali has also written on this matter.  As in -</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">With the aforementioned Atman-Bliss-filled state at the end of the yogakriya acquired through the grace of Sadguru, having left behind the happiness connected with the enjoyment of physical things, by which a type of care arises whereby the “yatamanavastha” is attained - the thread of vairagya appears in consciousness.  If one does not attempt to corrupt consciousness again by thoughts of things associated with sound, touch, sight, taste, smell, etc., and many such types of associations with bad company such as these, then by this type of practice, the second level of vairagya gradually arises in consciousness in the form of “vyatirekavastha,” and progressively, after the third level in the form of “ekendriyavastha” emerges, consciousness attains the ultimate end of vairagya - the “vashikaravastha.”  It is written in the Patanjal Yoga Sutra that it is in this “vashikaravastha” that the knowledge of Purusha, meaning the incisive vision of Purusha-Prakriti, is born in the jiva, and from the understanding of that Prakriti-Purusha, the spoken and the unspoken, meaning creation and destruction, or even the desire to be embodied are extinguished, the jiva attains that Eternal, filled with the Bliss of Knowledge, Brahman-ness.  As in -</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Now, the meaning of this sloka is this:  even if mind is brought into stillness momentarily by yogakriya, the always-restless consciousness of the matter-oriented mind again assumes its former condition; therefore, to quell the mind, meaning destroying this restless nature of mind, establishing stillness and experiencing the omnipresence of Total Brahman is tremendously difficult - there is no doubt about this.  But by attaining the stillness at the end of the yogakriya acquired by Sadguru’s grace, and continuously practicing the experience of Atman-Consciousness with reverence and pure work, the state of Bliss of Self-Knowledge is realized, and the enjoyment of happiness connected with physical things is understood as extremely trivial, and as the ultimate end of vairagya -”vashikaravastha” - becomes present, one becomes effortlessly aware that all of the Cosmos is filled with Total Brahman-Consciousness. - 35-</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Commentary:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It has been clearly explained in the commentary to the previous sloka that if one wants to control oneself, four states of being gradually arise in consciousness which are named, “yataman,” “vyatirek,” “ekindriya” and “vashikar.”  Among these states mentioned, Maharshi Patanjali has referred to the state named “vashikar” as being synonymous in meaning to “vairagya” [non-attachment].  Now, in this sloka, the matters on that which have been expressed as “vashyatma” or “samyatma” - which have been stated in regards to the sadhakas whose consciousnesses are absorbed the condition of “vashikaravastha” - are being explained below.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">In the state of the Self-revealed Consciousness, it can be known that those who are immersed in vairagya, meaning those whose consciousnesses have attained “vashikaravastha” -  by performing with great care the Sadguru-given way of yogakriya, they realize the Self-revealed Consciousness state and are able to live filled with the form of the Eternal Bliss of Knowledge.  But those who are not adjoined in vairagya, meaning those whose consciousnesses are inclined towards material things - for them the aforementioned state of being is ever unattainable. - 36-</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Commentary:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It has concluded in sloka no. 70 of the second chapter of this book that:  being bound to desire and in order to enjoy the fulfillment of the matters of desire, jivas take birth again and again; and in this chapter this type of essence has been expressed which says that when Atman-Consciousness is experienced by the reverent performance of Sadguru-instructed yogakriya, mind becomes filled with the Bliss of Self-Knowledge and wants to leave behind the pleasures connected with the enjoyment of external things.  Upon this, this type of doubt arises in the fire element that:  there are those who acquired the Bliss of Atman by the Sadguru-graced yogakriya, and by being enjoined in reverence of Atman-Consciousness, they wished to leave behind the paltry, momentary happiness connected with the enjoyment external things; but because of the state of vairagya in the mind becoming disrupted repeatedly, not being able to remain in Atman-Consciousness, they became faulty in their taking care, lackadaisical in their practice and never were they able to reside in the state of the Bliss-filled Eternal Knowledge.  O Kutasthachaitanya!  What will be the way for them?  Will these types of sadhakas who could not realize that Supreme Brahman-Substance and who, by having desisted sense-enjoyment, cannot take birth in the desire-oriented creation be eternally in a delusion-drenched state, like broken clouds floating in space until they are destroyed at the time of Final Dissolution? - 37 and 38-</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If the mind stays immersed in Kutasthachaitanya in the aforementioned manner, then even more is experienced, such that:  when the cessation of the fluctuations of consciousness is experienced via the practice of yogakriya, the very practice that yogis should do is to prevent the reemergence of that [the fluctuations] and rest in that state [of tranquility].  In this perspective, yoga and sannyas are not different.  Those who are not attracted to the sense-oriented things of sound, touch etc. or sense-oriented acts, who have renounced the desire for their fruits and who have fulfilled only what needs to be dutifully done, those who have renounced all desire and doubt of body, mind and even up to speech -   they are the ones who are yogis, and they are the ones who are sannyasis or renunciates.  Without this kind of renunciatioon there is no becoming a yogi or a sannyasi by just renouncing according to the methods of the Vedas or society [1 - 4].  In this world, one is one’s own friend and one is one’s own enemy.  When one can remain enjoined in Kutasthachaitanya, one can rescue oneself as one’s own friend from all sorrows of the world; this is what the jiva should do; the jiva should not instead break off from Consciousness and become enveloped by the sorrows of the world [5 - 6].   Kutasthachaitanya sadhakas, who are victorious over their senses, experience in this way the Substance beyond scriptural knowledge, become fully content, and residing completely and in profound Tranquility in union with the Supreme Substance, know gold, earth, stone etc. as undifferentiated Consciousness, and thereby are unperturbed by [the seeming differentiations of] friend, enemy, saint, wicked, cold, heat, pleasure, sorrow, honor, shame etc. [7 - 9].  With one-pointed focus of mind, alone in a solitary place, following the practices of not taking from anyone, chastity, continence, cleanliness etc., sitting on a seat of grass, skin and cloth, keeping body, neck and head still and steadfastly concentrating by techniques such as focusing at the root of the nose, and thereby withdrawing all senses and their associations, fastening consciousness in Kutasthachaitanya, and continuously remaining engaged in Its meditation, become one with that Supreme Nirvana-Form in the Abode of Tranquility, the Infinite Consciousness [10 -15].  This type of yogakriya is not within the capacity of those who overeat or fast, or those who oversleep or do not sleep at all.  If one can perform this while maintaining eating, recreation, sleeping, waking, work, effort etc. with regularity, then all sorrow is eradicated [16 - 17].</span><span class="calibre72"> </span><span class="calibre3">Thus ends the sixth chapter of the yogashastra upanishad Srimad Bhagavad Gita with analysis via various scriptures of this country and the West, along with spiritual commentary. </span> </p>
