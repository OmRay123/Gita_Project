   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Commentary:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">In these two slokas, the practice of “upasana” [commonly: worship], as has been understood by great knowledgeable saints, towards that Infinite Consciousness has been written about .. Therefore, what “upasana” is, who is decreed to be worshipped, and what is even the need for it - these matters should be addressed first. “Upasana” - this word is comprised of “up” and “aas.” “Up” means “nearness” and “aas” is used to mean “establishing.” Thus, the meaning of the word “upasana” can be understood to be: “being near.” Now, who should be worshipped and for what reason or its necessity etc. is being gradually explained.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The only necessity for the jiva, meaning the being, is the cessation of all types of sorrows from the adhibhautic [physical], adhidaivic [subtle] and adhyatmic [causal] essences. For this reason, the extinguishing of this threefold sorrow is what has been called in Samkhyadarshan as the purpose, or necessity, of the being. As in -</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">trividhaduhkhanivrittirartha purushanam - 1:1</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">To negate adhibhautic sorrow, the jiva again and again partakes in the usage of cuisine, haberdashery etc.; to end adhidaivic sorrow, it partakes again and again in the desirable things of sound, touch, sight, taste, smell etc.; and to stop adhyatmic sorrow, the jiva again and again engages in activities such as being in the company of the opposite sex. Because all these sorrows are temporarily ended by partaking in these desired things, these enjoyments are thought to be accomplishments necessary for the being’s life-purpose. But the wise have said that no type of sorrow born of desire is permanently extinguished through the partaking of things of desire; whatever [cessation] happens stays only momentarily; immediately afterwards, like the ghee oblation in fire, the sufferings burst afire again, this time with twice the force. As in -</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">“na jatu kamah kamanamupabhogena shamyati havisha krishnavartmaiva bhuya evabhivardhate”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If the jiva knew that by the partaking of these things of desire the force of the triumvirate of sorrows would increase twofold, then it would never be engaged in that. The jiva does not want this kind of way of being. The type of negation of the triumvirate of sorrows that it wants is such that they can never appear again. The jiva prays for the supreme substance of cessation, meaning the Supreme Nirvana. In Samkhyadarshan it has also been stated that the total ending of these three sorrows is the most important goal of the being or jiva. This supreme purpose of the being is the jiva’s prayer. As in -</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">tribidhaduhkhatyantanivritti paramapurusharthah - 1:2</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">In all types of philosophical scriptures, this has been concluded with certainty: that if one dies, then one must take birth, and if one takes birth, one will surely die. Therefore, the jiva, bound in this creation-samsara, cannot attain the Supreme Nirvana or the highest purpose of being while being enslaved by birth and death. To attain this, it is necessary to liberated from life and death. As in Samkhyadarshan -</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">na drishta drishtattat siddhih nivrittehpanurattidarshanat - 1:3 utkaryadapi mokshasya sarotkarshah shrute - 1:5</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It has also been concluded by all types philosophical scriptures that: if the jiva cannot abide in Kaivalyapada by not establishing himself in that Infinite Consciousness beyond creation, then he cannot ever attain that supreme purpose - meaning the complete cessation of all types of adhibhautic, adhidaivic and adhyatmic sorrows - that Supreme Nirvana. Therefore, to accomplish this highest purpose, it is extremely necessary to do upasana of Consciouness - meaning being near to Spirit. The eminent sages have decreed this upasana of Consciousness as the only process to attain the highest purpose. Maharshi Vedavyas, in the 35th sloka - pertaining to karmayoga - of the third chapter of this book, has also said this: that it is good to die during doing upasana of Consciousness; one should not do upasana to anything else; that is extremely dangerous.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It is by taking up the paths of devotion [bhakti] and wisdom/knowledge [jnana] that one can practice upasana of Atman-Consciousness. In these two slokas, Maharshi Vedavyas has taught us in one sloka the practice of upasana by the way of devotion, and in the other, the way of wisdom/knowledge.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The sadhakas on the path of bhakti, after having become devoid of restlessness, having become steadfast, with one-pointed devotion and heart completely engrossed, and always being engaged in the discussion of Spirit, stop being externalized and turn towards Atman, and thus always abide in that Consciousness-Self. - 14-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The sadhakas on the path of jnana, take their personal realizations - greater or lesser - revealed by yogic methods, where some experience the existence of Atman-Consciousness as separately residing in all the created things in the forms of Brahma, Rudra etc., some experience the existence of the only worshippable thing as Infinite Consciousness and oneself as the worshipper, and some experience even oneself to be a part of that All-pervading Consciousness, and thereby knowing all things of creation to be unsubstantial and experiencing that only Atman-Consciousness exists, do upasana to that Infinite Consciousness. - 15-</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">SUMMARIZED DESCRIPTION OF CHAPTER 9</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Keeping the mind absorbed in Kutastha in this way and becoming empty of hatred and condemnation, this supreme happiness-giving, directly obtained, highest of all, extremely secret, and greatest wisdom which is Spirit is experienced. Jivas are liberated by It from the sufferings of samsara. And lacking It, the irreverent ones are repeatedly enslaved by life and death [1 - 3]. Like air in the sky, Infinite Consciousness unabsorbedly pervades created things and thus sustains and governs them. But the strange mystery is this: even though it is existing in Consciousness, the phenomenal world is abiding un-Consciously [4 -6]. The Consciousness-imbued Prakriti keeps this three-guna-entranced phenomenal world under the power of ever-repeating creation and dissolution; but Infinite Consciousness, being aloof and detached from the works of creation, is not enmeshed in that [7 -10]. Stupefied by the hope of useless pleasure, or useless enjoyments of indulgences, or useless argumentative scriptural knowledge, the ignorant ones acquire demonic characteristics, and not being able to comprehend the Supremeness of Infinite Consciousness, perceive It in the form of created things [11 - 12]. But the ones of wisdom, knowing Infinite Consciousness as being before creation and Imperishable, take refuge in the subtle nature and do upasana - some in the dvaita [dualistic] form, some in the advaita [monistic] form, and some in many different ways. And devotees remain steadfast and engrossed, humbly worship That and do upasana while singing Its praises [13 -15]. Infinite Consciousness Itself is the fulfilling wealth for this realm, the fulfilling funerals for the realm of the ancestors, and the fulfilling oblations and the articles of ritual for the realm of the gods; It is the mother, father, grandfather and Lord of this world; It is the Knowledge of Pranava, and It is the three Vedas providing the way to that Knowledge, and It is That Which is to be Known. It is in Him that this world’s creation, preservation and destruction take place, and He is the Primordial Seed of all. It is He Who is the giver of heat and the creator of cold; and it is He Who is residing as the Creator and as the created things [16 - 19]. The brahmins who perform Vedic rites perform yajna with the desire to attain the realm of heaven; attaining which, they partake in enjoyments in the manner of the gods, and after the benefits of good works end, they again acquire a physical body. In this way, they are trapped over and over in samsara [20 - 22]. Infinite Consciousness is the Lord of all rites and It is their enjoyer. No matter what god is worshipped by one, beyond the rules, he is actually worshipping that Infinite Consciousness. Whatever aspect to which one does upasana, whether gods, subtle aspects, physical aspects, ghosts etc. - one attains that state of being. One who with one-pointed heart does upasana of Consciousness - his finds his Spirit Self-revealed and is bestowed that state of being. It is because jivas do not know this that they are repeatedly bound by samsara [23 - 25]. Whoever uses whatever for the sake of Consciousness, by that itself Spirit is pleased; therefore, if one can submit all works of the world to Spirit, then by that Spirit is pleased and one can attain the Beingness of Consciousness. Thus, one no longer has to be trapped by the fruits of good and bad karma [26 -27]. Even persons of the most vile character, by doing upasana to Consciousness, within a short time become righteous in Atman and attain Infinite Peace; in this type of condition, they should be considered as the highest of sages, because by them abiding in Consciousness, even though Infinite Consciousness is Omnipresent, It reveals Itself to them [28 - 31]. What to say of the sanctified souls of brahmins and devoted royal sages, even the greatly downtrodden uneducated and farm laborers attain that Supreme Substance by taking up refuge in Consciousness. Therefore, one should know Infinite Consciousness as the Supreme Substance, and with one-pointed mind and devotion, humbly bowing to It and doing upasana to It, attain that Infinite Consciousness-filled Brahman [32 - 34].</span> </p>
