   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">By researching the science of creation one can know that from the gods to mobile and immobile matter, all things are following their own nature and are being created accordingly in new and different forms. And being bound to such nature, one form is being discarded and again a new one is being created. But Atman-Consciousness is eternal and immutable, and is present in the same way everywhere. This has been clearly explained in previous slokas of this book. Now, it is being revealed in sloka that the beneficent or maleficent works by the Prakriti-deviation-culture of body, mind, intellect and sensory functions are affecting in their various ways only the nature of jivas. No diminution or expansion happens to the Atman-Consciousness by this. It is eternal and immutable. Ignorance, meaning Prakriti, is not in Consciousness and is engaged in acquiring externally. From such deviation many types of things have arisen and they are keeping the Consciousness in the form of Knowledge in jivas covered in stupor. Because of this, jivas have become deluded, and unable to realize this, they are bound to this worldly life. - 15-</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Commentary:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">What attachment to partaking/enjoyment [bhoga] and salvation, meaning liberation, are - if they are not clearly explained, then there is a significant possibility of confusion arising in trying to understand sevveral circuitous slokas of this chapter. Therefore, what is written in Patanjal Darshan about the aforementioned bhoga and salvation from it are being explained below.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Purusha, meaning jivatman, is the immutable Consciousness-Substance. Prakriti, being in the presence of this Consciousness and being Its mirror, creates a new type of substance, as iron is energized in the presence of a magnet, and by this manifests as the numerous elemental and sensory objects and their workings. All of these elemental and all internal and external sensory matter - up until the Absolute - are imbued with the three gunas: revelatory sattva, active rajas, and veiling and inertia-producing tamas. These comprise what is called “drishya” [scene, or that which is seen/perceived]. In this way, Prakriti, a reflection of Consciousness manifesting as the innumerable things, is experienced in the jiva-consciousness. This is why the jiva-consciousness is usually called “drashta” [perceiver/witness]. When in order to perceive these perceptible things [drishya padartha] the jiva-consciousness joins Prakriti-Shakti, sound, touch, sight, taste, scent, pleasure and pain etc. manifest as the innumerable things and are experienced by the jiva. This is what is called the jiva’s “bhoga.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">In this way, all of these perceptible things or the matters of bhoga are only mutations of Consciousness by the Prakriti-Shakti union. Thus, this Consciousness is the Soul-Self of these innumerable perceptible things. Just as the intoxicated state of mind caused by drinking liquor seems to be pleasure to the drinker of liquor, in the same way, the state caused by partaking [bhoga] in sensory matters seems to be pleasure for the undiscriminating. But if one does a little thoughtful analysis, one can see that it is because of being under the power of this need to partake/enjoy [bhoga] that jivas are unable to have peace. Just as throwing clarified butter in fire causes the fire to burn more instead of extinguishing it, in the same way, instead of peace, the partaking/enjoying causes desire and cravings to grow, and by that jivas become intensely engaged in fulfilling desires, incurring great suffering. (“na jatu kamah kamanamupabhogena samyati. habishakrishnavartmaiva bhuya evabhivardhate.”) Thus, sorrow is the end result of all bhoga. One suffers greatly by constantly thinking about and trying to maintain and protect the things to be enjoyed [matters of bhoga]. Thus, this bhoga is accompanied by sorrow, or suffering. The samskaras [tendencies] that are born of this bhoga are also full of suffering. For example, the samskara arising from becoming attached to the bhoga of seating in a plush velvet seat in a beautifully perfumed place causes displeasure at sitting in any other condition in the world. Staying even a moment at any place causes great suffering. Because these momentary and fleeting enjoyments are imbued with the sattva, rajas and tamas gunas, they are often at odds with each other and this also brings tremendous suffering to the jiva. Knowing all bhoga to be filled with sorrow because of these reasons, the discriminating ones take care to renounce all partaking/enjoyment of sense objects.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">By delusion, ignorance and unawareness, the five kleshas [afflictions] with affinity, hate etc. arise in the perceptible matters of the jiva, and in order to fulfill the experiences of partaking accordingly, the jiva-consciousness remains in a distorted state, bound to the power of Prakriti. Stilling the fluctuations of consciousness by yogakriya and thereby being the perceiver/witness, the source of the five kleshas, meaning the field of ignorance, delusion or Prakriti, from which all bhoga has arisen, is revealed, and experiencing the Substance hidden within all bhoga, or that Consciousness as the Self in them, jivas are no longer bound to Prakriti for the purpose of bhoga. In this way, when ignorance is destroyed and attachment is no more, all distortion vanishes, and the entire Cosmos is revealed as the Jiva-Consciousness-Self. This is what is called salvation or liberation in the scriptural treatises.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Therefore, those who can understand the secret matter of these things that are perceptible - which act as the provider of bhoga for the undiscriminating ones - those discriminating ones are prepared for the gift of liberation. In this way, jivas experience themselves as the Self in all things in the world-Brahmanda and realize themselves as pervading all things in the Universe. Therefore, in the Cosmos, there is no experience of a second anything separate from the Self. This type of state is called the Purusha’s or jiva’s “kevalatva” or “Kaivalya” state of existence. When this state is attained, then all bhoga and desires are devoid, and jivas do not ever again have to take birth in this samsara.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre20">“prakashakriyasthitishilam bhutendriyatmakam bhogapavargartham drishyam” -  2-18 “drashadrishimatrah shuddhohpi pratyanupashyah” -  2-20 “swaswamishaktyah swarupopalabdhihetuh samyogah” -  2-23 “tadartha eva drishyatma” -  2-21 “parinama tapasamskara duhkaigurnavrittivirodhaccha sarvameva duhkham vivekakinah” -  2-15 “tasya heturavidyah” -  2-24 “yogashchittavritti nirodhah” -  1-2 “tadadrashtuh svarupehvasthanam” -  1-3 “avidyakshetramuttaresham prasupta tanuvicchinnodayanam” -  2-4 “anityashuchiduhkhanatmasu nityashuchi sukhatma khyatirvidya” -  2-5 “tadabhavat samyogabhabvohanam tadvasheh kaivalam” -  2-25</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Now, it can be clearly understood in these two slokas that as jivas gradually realize Atman-Consciousness by the Sadguru-instructed Kriya and thereby eradicate the manifestation of this greatly destructive unawareness, meaning ignorance, that all-revealing Knowledge like the sun reveals this infinite Universe and the entire Cosmos, and thus they gradually experience that Supreme Substance Infinite Consciousness. In this way, having eliminated the presence and effect of ignorance, when by doubt-free and steady perception that Infinite Consciousness is experienced, the wise and discriminating sadhakas, remaining self-disciplined and keeping the consciousness engaged in Atman and apart from all bhoga, take refuge in that Infinite Consciousness and become liberated from this horrific, destructive suffering of samsara. These types of “jivanmukta” [liberated while alive in the body] sadhakas never again have to be bound to take birth in the world. - 16 and 17-</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">All of the bhoga-oriented pleasures that arise from the union with sensory things are the source of all of the types of suffering. They manifest as sorrow; even at the time of enjoyment there is sorrow and misery; even the samskaras [tendencies] because of these are filled with suffering. And because the minutely manifesting sattva, rajas and tamas guna-connected characteristics are fighting with each other, these pleasures remain only for a minute amount of time. It is for this reason that the discriminating wise ones never are attracted to these. It is expressed in this way in the Patanjal philosophical treatise: as in -</span> </p>

Thus, they have the Universe-pervading experience that there is nothing other than Atman-Consciousness in the Universe. This is what the great sages have called “Kevalatva” or “Kaivalyapada.” - 29-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">SUMMARIZED DESCRIPTION OF CHAPTER 5</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When sadhakas are in the state of absorption in the Kutastha, many wonderful facets of the yoga of performing Kriya and the yoga of renouncing all action, as expressed in previous chapters, are experienced; then a desire to know which is the greater of these occurs in the energy of the rajoguna. At this, an experience happens by Kutasthachaitanya that performing yogakriya and renouncing all karma by residing in a state of non-doing - when either is practiced with complete focus - one can attain Kaivalyapada. The wise see both as of the same stature; only the immature and ignorant think that these two are different. Even if the organs of perception - sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, the organs of action - speech, receiving, motion, excretion and urination, the inner organs - mind, observation, understanding, intellect and dreams are all engaged in their respective work, Kriyavan sadhakas as Atman-Consciousness reside separately from the sense-body in tranquil non-attachment. This is because they are devoid of conflicts brought about by affinity and dislike etc., and they are not attached to those works. Therefore, even though they work, they are renunciates of all work and ever the sannyasis. In this way, the condition of sannyas can be attained with ease. But trying to attain this state without yogakriya leads only to suffering. Therefore, although either the performance of Kriya or the renunciation of all action are both liberation-endowing, the performance of Kriya is better. Atman-Consciousness, the Lord of this miniature Cosmos of the body is not involved in any work. It does not cause any other to be involved, nor does It have any craving to enjoy any karmic bhoga. Therefore, no diminution or expansion happens to Atman-Consciousness due to the routine workings of the body; only the prakriti of the jiva is affected. Atman-Consciousness is eternally immaculate and eternally immutable. All worldly work is being done by Its natural law through Maya. Other than partaking due to one’s own desire, no one has to be a recipient of its fruits. By ignorance or unawareness, wisdom is veiled, and because jivas are connected to that and enraptured by that, they cannot understand this. By yogakriya this ignorance is destroyed and when the all-exposing sun-like Knowledge of Atman-Consciousness is revealed, all of these things are understood. Then sadkakas, by having worn away prarabdha, for the sake of self-purification having renounced all desires to partake/enjoy, being united and immersed in Atman-Consciousness, residing in Supreme Happiness in the city of nine gates or the body, not being enmeshed as the Self during all works of the world nor causing anyone to be enmeshed in such, having renounced all karma, and accomplishing all work at hand by the body, mind, intellect and the senses alone, live liberated from the sufferings of samsara. But jivas without Kriya, being under the stupor of ignorance, see themselves as doing all the works by the body etc., and thereby desiring to enjoy the fruits of such work, remain bound to this samsara. When Self-Knowledge is revealed, the differences in a cow, an elephant, a dog and such classes of nature, or the differences between a highly educated and humble Kriyavan brahmin or a low-kriya [disrespectful action] oriented base person and the differences even within one class with the innumerable permutations of Prakriti manifesting - despite the differences, the sadhakas experience the Self in all things as the unalloyed and immutable Brahman-Consciousnesss existing everywhere equally. Thus, they are not overly elated at gaining something desirable, nor are they despondent over having gotten something undesirable. In this way, having destroyed all distortions and ideas of dissimilarity in the mind, with steadiness of perception, sadhakas are freed from all delusions in the world, and having eradicated and become victorious over birth and death, they attain that immutable and all-pervading state of equanimity of the Brahman-State. The wise know that all of these fleeting and momentary pleasures of bhoga, which are of the sense-objects, are the wellspring of all suffering, and they are not attracted by them. If attachment to all these lust- and anger-force-produced desires of bhoga can be checked and ended, then jivas can gain happiness within, and being immersed in Atman-Consciousness, in the end, having become one with that Infinite Consciousness, attain the indestructible happiness of Tranquility. Understanding all this, Kriyavans and sadhakas who know the Self eliminate all conflict and doubt, renounce all partaking/enjoyment associated with sense-objects, discipline the mind, intellect and the senses, become free from the forces of lust, anger etc. by having attained liberation, with a consciousness devoid of desire, fear and anger, focus wholly within where the eyebrows unite and where Consciousness in the form of Light is revealed, equally still prana and apana, gain complete steadfastness within, attain the highest samadhi of asamprajnata state, eradicate the greatly destructive ignorance and all samskaras, and realizing oneself to be that Infinite Consciousness in all elements as the Self who is enjoyer of all spiritual work, they become one with all things, pervading all in the Cosmos and attain the indestructible Supreme Happiness of Kaivalyapada.</span> </p>
