   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">Sri Bhagavan said:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">abhayam satvasamshuddhirjnanayogavyavasthitih danam damashcha yajnashcha svadyhyayantapa arjavam - 1-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">1) It is being experienced via Kutastha - the fear of death - that gradually goes away upon abiding in the par avastha of Kriya - abiding always in the sushumna, by the pure intelligence in all types of things and ways, all is seen; “jnana” [Divine Knowledge] - abiding in Yonimudra; doing dharana, dhyan, samadhi - after doing, there is complete Stillness; the offering of Kriya, the vanquishing of senses and such, and performing Kriya, and Tranquilly residing in the Supreme Intelligence beyond intelligence, residing in Kutastha - being simple - as long as there is desire for any sense objects, there is never simplicity, and envy/aggression cannot be stopped as well - which should happen - if oneself does not see OneSelf, how can one see another; one who will see Himself - he will see everyone as the same.  If one resides in the par avastha of Kriya, because of all becoming one, oneself is completely content in OneSelf, which Kriyanvita persons are witnessing.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">ahimsa satyamakrodhantyagah shantirapaishunam daya bhutesvaloluptam mardavam hrirachapalam - 2-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">2) If there is no envy/aggression, desire does not remain - if one does not reside in the par avastha of Kriya, desire is not destroyed - all of the things that you are seeing - absolutely all are false, because you are seeing verily everything; in the par avastha of Kriya, nothing at all can be seen - therefore, Truth is that Brahman; in the par avastha of Kriya, this type of feeling: I exist - is not felt; when oneself is not, then the other is also not; in what way can anger remain and for whom?  In the par avastha of Kriya, no desire for sense objects remain; therefore if there is no desire itself, then what of its fruits?  In the par avastha of Kriya - neither am I anything, nor is anything mine - I myself am not; with whom will I do malice - I will be immersed in joy, and I will let others be immersed in joy - this is what is called mercy.  There is no other thing besides Brahman - in what shall I have greed - trumped above the words of everyone - wisdom words soaked and heavy - meaning words and wisdom of value which should be applied - does not come out of the mouth of anyone at all, that which happens in the par avastha of Kriya - then, no restlessness remains.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">tejah kshama dhritih shouchamadroho natimanita bhavanti sampadam daivimabhijatasya bharata - 3-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">3) Power - meaning the power of mind, by which all is seen and done - not paying attention to any sense objects, bestows mercy - remains Tranquil in OneSelf; always resides in Brahman - does not knowingly cause harm to others - does not have lust for great honor; what little [honor] there is, is natural and appropriate - all these - continuously abiding in the par avastha of Kriya, residing always in Brahman, all of these states of being are attained equally.  This is what is known as “daivi sampad” [Divine Qualities/Possessions].</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">dambhodarpohbhimanashcha krodhah parushyameva cha ajnanam chabhijatasya partha sampadamasurim - 4-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">4) Internally boasting as one of high caste/class - going about puffing out one’s chest [throwing around one’s weight] because one has strength - praying for more honor than what is natural and appropriate - remaining angry all the time - saying cruel words - and not abiding in Atman - meaning not performing Kriya - these are all “asuri sampad” [demonic qualities/possessions] - meaning, those who do not perform Kriya - for them, this type of character and behavior happen automatically.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">daivi sampadvimokshaya nibandhayasuri mata ma shuchah sampadam daivimabhijatohsi pandava - 5-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">5) Daivi sampad, about which I have spoken above - these are especially of liberation, upon abiding in the par avastha of Kriya; and the demonic mode of being - meaning, the suffocating bondage because of not performing Kriya - putting attachment-filled attention on other things, one becomes owned by those things.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">dvou bhutasargou lokesmindaiva asura eva cha daivo vistarahah prokta asuram partha me shrinu - 6-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">6) Two types of people, one divine, one demonic - I have spoken much about the subject of the divine person; now I am speaking about those who do not perform Kriya and who keep their minds on other things.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">pravrittim cha nivrittim cha jana na vidurasurah na shoucham napi chacharo na satyam teshu vidyate - 7-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">7) Thinking one time “I will do” and then again thinking “I will not do” - those who do not perform this Kriya, they get these kinds of feelings - they do not remain in Brahman - meaning, there is no certainty in any matter - do not remain in any one character of behavior - lying only, cannot speak the truth - Truth is not with them at all.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">asatyamapratishtham te jagadahuranishvaram aparasparasmbhutamkimanyat kamahetukam - 8-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">8) It is falsehood that they have set upon [established] - in this world, they say that there is no one as God; it has happened on its own - their minds are comparable to prostitutes, and there is nothing else.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">etam drishtimavashtabhya nashtatmanohlpabuddhayah prabhavantyugrakarmanah kshayaya jagatohhitah - 9-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">9) Keeping attention in this way - those who do not themselves abide in the Self - meaning, do not perform Kriya - they cannot keep their intellect steadfast on anything - despicable deeds, killing etc. - for this reason the world is destroyed - that which causes malice to others - that they do.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">kamamashritya dushpuram dambhamanamadanvitah mohadgrihitvasadgrahan pravartantehshuchivratah - 10-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">10) Having sexual intercourse is what is good - they boast about this itself - chest puffed up with delusion, do not take up the things of Truth - meaning, they have totally eradicated Truth.  The things other than Brahman - they are engaged [involved] with those very things - OM OM.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">chintamaparimeyam cha pralayantamupashritah kamopabhogaparama etavaditi nishchitah - 11-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">11) There is no end to worry - the type of thought at the time of the Great Dissolution, that type - they know eating and having sexual intercourse - nothing else at all is good, this is certain.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">ashapashashatairbaddhah kamakrodhaparayanah ihante kamabhogarthamanyaenarthasanchayan - 12-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">12) Bound by many types of hopes - they earn money through hundreds and hundreds of wrongdoings - meaning, they even kill someone and take money - locked in only lust and anger - taking that money, they have sexual intercourse and eat.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">idamadya maya labdhamimam prapsye manoratham idamantidamapi me bhavishyati punardhanam - 13-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">13) Today, I got 25 [rupee or other money]; I will get another 50 if I kill a person - here is now 75 - I will get another 25; won’t I get another 25?  If that happens then there will be 100.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">14) This time I really killed the enemy - any more buggers that come, I will kill them too - I am the one who is God; I am the one who is the enjoyer; I am the one who is realized; I am the one who is mighty, happy.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">adhyohbhijanavanasmi kohnyohsti sadrisho maya yakshye dasyamimodishya ityajnanavimohitah - 15-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">15) I am greater than everyone; I have plenty of people; there is no one who can be compared to me - being deluded in this kind of ignorance.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">anekachittavibhranta mohajalasamavritah prasaktah kamabhogeshu patanti narakehshuchou - 16-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre17">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">16) Being covered by the net of delusion and all kinds of afflictions of the heart [chitta] - being addicted to lust and worldly enjoyment [bhoga] - falls and remains in hell - meaning, becomes one who is in misery.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre17">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">17) Boasting about whatever one owns; lounging pridefully on a dais - does some one or other type of puja for the sake of name, without the mind being steady at all.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre17">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">18) Ego, might, arrogance, lust, anger - taking recourse in these, is aggressive and envious towards other people.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">19) I throw these types of vicious people into those demonic births, those who among humans are “adham” [basest] - the “m” sound is for the jeweled Kutastha; whoever resides below that - meaning, one who does not reside in Kutastha - it is he who is “adham”!!!</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">21) Lust, anger and greed - it is by staying in these three that one is not able to abide in Atman; therefore, these should be renounced [tyaga] - the meaning of “tyaga” is - being without the desire for results.</span> </p>
