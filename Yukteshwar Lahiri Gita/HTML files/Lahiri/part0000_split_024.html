How can I can carry on in this samsara,” and uselessly pass through time in this way.  People think, “I am eating from having earned it.”  But one is obviously and clearly seeing - which people do not see even after looking - that a dead person does not eat - He is residing in me, and thus it is He who is eating; and that the One who is eating is also the One who is eating all things in all places, having taken the form of jiva - there is a bug in the teeth of even the exemplary [even seers do not see/no set precedents show perfection]; He is the One Brahman in all phenomena and in jivas, and is spoken about as Maheshvara, Jaganmay, Jagannath, Brahmamay in all scriptures.  If one abides in Him, one becomes He Himself - that, which even though known in the par avastha of Kriya, cannot be found by anyone - therefore: Avyakta [undefinable, unspeakable].  Only - after 1728 pranayams, yogis are on the way of dhyan.  It is He Who is the Kutastha after Self.  It is in this very body that one can see One Supreme Person after Kutastha, via knowing Kriya through the teachings of Guru (in this body).*</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">32) In the way that space moves in subtle form throughout all in the immense Universe - meaning, stillness - its function is stillness and movement both!!  In the path of the subtle is Stillness, in the path of the physical is movement!!!  But subtleness is functioning as non-enmeshed [nirlipta].  In that way, the microcosm, in atomic form, is in all bodies - Brahman is pervading but in Stillness.  In that way, the Self in the body - which is the microcosmic Brahman - is residing in all places.  Movement is happening, yet there is Stillness!!  As soon as there is Stillness there is Nirlipta Brahman - That Stillness is the par avastha of Kriya - one who does not have It is residing in the world - meaning, from the time of birth onward, is only living in movement.  The way to stop the movement of the Universe is just this Kriya - which is transmitted via Guru and can be done with ease.  Only having a bit of priority to keeping attention in this direction [is needed] and “one will be pulled along by the current only”* - grab hold of a pillar [post] which is within you.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">33) Just as one sun illuminates the entire earth, in the same way the Embodied One illuminates this body - (Note)* - as long as there is darkness - meaning, oneself’s attention, filled with attachment, is elsewhere, and the Atman’s sun-like illumination via Kutastha is not being revealed.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">34) The field and the knower of the field - meaning, the body and the embodied - are known as soon as the Knowledge-Eye Kutastha is revealed - meaning, Yonimudra - mind does not go in other directions and stays only in that Divine Sight - which is transmitted via Guru’s teaching!  The five elements - Muladhar, Svadhisthan, Manipura, Anahata, Vishuddhakhya - these five elements - the Self-linga - intercourse is done by the linga in the linga - when mind is stilled, there will be intelligence - after intelligence is Parabuddhi [Intelligence which is Beyond] - meaning, the Purusha after Prakriti - that is Itself Me-Brahman!!  It functions like - Prakriti, in the Mighty Form of Kali - mounted on top of Maheshvara is slaying everyone in Her own maya.  Mahadeva takes Her back in His very own Form.  Once taken, attention is no longer in other directions - the Self remains in the Self - that is the par avastha of Kriya, and beyond all - merging in that - this is what is known as Moksha [liberation].  This itself is the Supreme Thing, this itself is the Supreme Thing.</span> </p>
