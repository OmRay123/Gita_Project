   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">5) Sattva, rajah, tamah, the forms of ida, pingala, sushumna - mounted on the machine, they, with the five elements, mind, intellect and ego, looking with attachment-filled attention in directions other than Atman [or] Brahman, have [seemingly] bound the embodied - the Indestructible Atman, Kutastha Brahman!!  It is upon the liberation from that bondage that He is the Pure Free Buddha Being - the Form of Stillness after Kriya - the drum-stick will fall with a bang.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">6) There - meaning in the par avastha of Kriya – the five elements, mind, intellect, ego - it is in these that there is impurity - being without these and abiding in Atman is Purity.  Kutastha Brahman!!  When any thing becomes pure, Light is attained - the sword that has become rusted, if one cleans that via Kriya- which is transmitted via the teachings of Guru - such a Light manifests on that sword that one is able to see one’s own face. It is this that Patanjal has called in the Sutras as “Svarupa Darshanam” (meaning, in the natural mirror, the Self can see OneSelf)* - when the Self sees OneSelf and OneSelf becomes Brahman, then All is Brahman! And one sees All; thus the Light Itself is the Form - of Brahman! It is this that is spoken about in Vedanta as “Svaprakashasvarupa” [Light of Self-Revelation]. When all have become one thing, then how can there be any kind of destruction and another thing with an end - therefore - “avinashi” [indestructible] - devoid of mutation - if desiring attachment-filled pleasure from other things, He resides suffocated and bound in that.  Leaving that and residing as the Self in Atman - meaning, performing Kriya - there is liberation - meaning the par avastha of Kriya.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">7) “Rajah” - meaning ida; attachment-filled desire in some other thing - if it happens via Atman, it happens - if one prays for, wishes for and looks at that thing for a long time, one has the desire to have that thing with great expectation, which, when one does not get it, causes one to become extremely desperate.  That is what is known as “trishna” [thirst]; that thirst has bound you up quite well and is making you stand with hands joined together [in the form of prayer].   Because, by that thing, “my mind will have the fruit of satisfaction for a little while.”  In this way, that standing form is fulfilling karma in desire - within this body in the Form of Kutastha - meaning, Mahadeva’s - like some person standing in front of a confectioner’s shop.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">8) Not residing in Atman - putting attachment-filled attention in other things is called “tamoguna” - meaning, pingala - all embodied ones - meaning, Mahadeva - have been kept mesmerized; otherwise the jiva itself is Shiva - meaning, performance of Kriya, which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru.  All of these acts by which He is being bound - with complete attachment in those, with chitta gone in that direction, full of expectation, like a drunken fool, what He says to whomever - false, and cannot pursue things - not being able to do so, He is agitated by His own heat [madness] and thus is madly dancing in many forms, and is passing through time in this way.  And He says “I have no time for anything” - and what He does, that He also does not know, because He is drunk!!!!  When opportunity for some good karma [action] comes in front of Him, to that He says, “I will do it later” - that “later” becomes later and later, and after that is sleep!!!!!!! OM.  As much as there is no priority, it is even more than that - meaning - even after having gone to bed in the early evening, rising late in the first part of the day - laziness - how many days like this?  Without a [physical] jail - even if it is said, it will not be heeded - what strange bondage without any binding - meaning, oneself is bound by oneself - meaning, no one even says “you should go to sleep” - “prostitute yourself” and such things.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">9) If one always abides in Atman - meaning, performs Kriya, happiness arises in all ways - abiding automatically and naturally in happiness, one attains the Supreme Bliss of the par avastha of Kriya.  The Bliss about which no one has the ability to speak - the reason why It is “avyakta” [unspoken] - known by oneself - later cannot make anyone know.  The temporary fruits which come about through rajoguna with its desire for results - meaning, “this land is mine for a hundred years and there is no assurance as to whose it will be after that - the land is ten hands long, three and one-half hands wide, for which ten people will be murdered and how much will be the profit?”  The one who, by berating over and over about this becomes poor - this type of hobbyist-poor is the worker of rajoguna.  It is in this type of karma [action] that so many people are caught up - and who is this “I”?  And what is Atman?  That, even by mistake, does not come to mind from the time of birth until death - yet there is the sound of “gyan-gyan, ghan-ghan” [noisy bleating of pseudo-knowldege]; telling people “because I am rich, I will be wise,” and being like this.  Thus, filled with attachment, he pretty much spends all of his time on other things and discussions and such.  Whatever is left - that is lost in the snores of sleep, hidden every day in undisciplined state, and he lays fallen in deep darkness - therefore, it is because there is no Light that one has to live in darkness.  The Light which one must search for with self-effort.  Even knowing and hearing about that, he says things like, “I love to stay in that darkness” - “I have money, I’m eating, enjoying, shitting fluidly, I’m quite fine.”  Living in this type of indulgent darkness of falsehood and being intoxicated in this for a short time, death comes and grabs him like a bug.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">10) First, one kills a person - having killed, he begins to grieve; in this way, covered by rajah and tamoguna, he takes up sattva guna - meaning, he comes to Benares [Varanasi] and becomes a Brahmachari [celibate monk] - because he has killed, he wails “oh! oh!” - from rajo guna, he comes to sattva guna, and then again he begins to say, “What will wailing do? I killed. So - fine. I did” - he comes to tamoguna from sattva guna; later he thinks that “What I did was not very good” - and again he comes to sattva guna from tamoguna.  Now, the one whom he had killed - people come again to fight on that person’s behalf - thus, from sattva guna, again he comes to rajoguna - death takes away these types of “palm-leaf soldiers” with the blow of one breath. </span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">11) If attention is there, then the Light of Atman can take birth in all of the senses [gates] of this body.  That Knowledge of Kriya is happening, which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru.  That “vidya” [knowledge] is truly vidya; all else is “avidya” [ignorance/not-knowledge] - meaning, knowing that is truly knowing, and all else is not-knowing.  When that Kriya expands is when one resides in sattva guna.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">12) The preliminary state of the condition in which one’s heart goes in the direction of one’s desire-filled, thoroughly attachment-filled attention on some sense-object is called “lobha” [greed].  “Pravritti” - to completely keep mind on that thing constantly and always, becoming like that thing is called “pravritti” [engagement]; thoroughly eyeing something with attachment and suddenly taking action for it is called “arambha” [starting]; performing action with the craving for its fruits is called “karma.”  Not stopping desire in all ways - meaning, “I lost at this door; I’ll go to another door” - meaning, the lowest court of justice, small court of justice, superior court of justice etc. - these are all acts of rajoguna, the acts from the expansion of rajoguna.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">13) Putting attachment-filled attention in directions other than Atman, residing in tamoguna, and pravritti - when the heart, filled with attachment, completely goes in that direction - meaning becoming that itself - being thoroughly drunk with that, entering that and being enraptured with that - these are all acts from the expansion of tamoguna.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">14) True expansion in sattva guna will occur when one abides in the par avastha of Kriya and merge there - then, that which is called “supreme” - meaning, Kutastha Brahman of the Cosmos, traveling to the Plane of Brahman - residing there - where there is no impurity of any kind - meaning, residing in the Pure Brahman.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">15) When one goes and becomes thoroughly merged in rajoguna, then one performs actions with the craving for results - and when one becomes thoroughly merged in tamoguna, then one attains a state which is like that of an ignorant person - like an idiot!!!!  Awakened idiot (Brahman)* - is wanton in Brahman.  That is - he knows everything, yet he does not know.  Unconscious idiot (Brahman)** - is wanton with prostitutes - “does not know anything at all, yet says I know everything.”***</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">16) That act, which mind takes up without the desire for results - that is this Kriya, which is acquired through the teachings of Guru - this virtuous work of Truth, this sattvic karma [action] - its pure fruit is Brahman, which happens in the par avastha of Kriya.  The fruit of rajoguna - meaning, doing action with the desire for results itself causes sorrow - keeping attachment-filled attention elsewhere and residing in tamoguna - who is this “I” - that thing one cannot know - thus, he is unconscious - the result of tamoguna - like when some gentleman goes to a house of ill-repute and he himself forgets who he is.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">27) When, from the continuous performance of Kriya, there is True Stillness in that Brahman, then one attains Immortality, and Nectar falls - meaning, one becomes the One Brahman - then of course, One is the Immortal Indestructible - because, when all becomes Brahman, that which will be destroyed is also Brahman; if it [all] is One Substance without end, how can there be destruction?  If one always stays in that state - meaning, resides in that state in all parts of the day and night - he also becomes Brahman - this is what is known as “dharma” - performing Kriya without the desire for results is called “dharma,” which is transmitted via the teachings of Guru - residing where, there is one Happiness - meaning, one eternally resides in that One State of Supreme Bliss; which is experienced in the par avastha of Kriya by all those who perform Kriya, more or less - and it is for this Happiness that everyone is slaving for others, and murdering while “mahasaya, mahasaya” [respected sir] is said!!  But that rare Mahasaya - about whom Ashtavakra has spoken - meaning, the one who is always, constantly and totally lodged in Kutastha by Divine perception and with the Power of Self, and who does not see anything other than That Substance - it is he who is “Mahat” [great] or “Mahasaya” - that is who is a great person - whatever is given, there is happiness for a little while after having that; but the Happiness which has no end - no one at all wishes to attain that kind of Happiness - all people of all kinds must desire this Happiness!!!</span> </p>
