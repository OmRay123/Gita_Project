   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">4) The ignorant say that “Samkhya” and “Yoga” are different; [but] abiding in either one of the two begets the results of both - because pranayam is spoken about in both.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">6) If there is no yoga, then there is sorrow in the practice of renunciation [sannyas] - being united in yoga, one goes quickly to Brahman - because when one casts off one thing from the mind, another thing appears.  Through yoga, the mind is stilled, and thus that [appearance of endless things to renounce] cannot again happen.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">7) Remaining entrenched in yoga - oneself becomes pure and completely embedded in Atman, and vanquishing all senses, one sees that the Self in all things is One’s Self - he is not enmeshed in anything, even while performing all karma [actions].</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">8 - 9) I do not do anything at all - I remain always stuck in Brahman - in the par avastha of Kriya, I see, hear, touch, sleep, inhale and exhale, shout crazy things, take, smell, blink and unblink - the senses do the work of the senses - this kind of state.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">10) Meditating upon Brahman, I perform all karma [actions] without desiring results; thus, I am not bound by any sins - as the essence of Brahman is extremely subtle, likened to the essence of the lotus leaf, know this.  And the essence of water is likened to worldly existence. Thus, just as water floats on top of the lotus leaf*, in the same way, all karma floats around on top of the essence of Brahman - even while doing all worldly karma is not bound.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[*Translator’s note:  Normally, the analogy given is one of the lotus (flower or leaf) floating on top of the water, but in this case, Yogiraj’s comments are about water on top of the leaf.

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">11) By the body, by the mind and intellect, by only the eye - yogis perform karma - meaning - perform Kriya while being devoid of desire, for the sake of keeping oneself in Brahman.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">12) Remaining still in the par avastha of Kriya - being without the fruits of actions - neither am I anything, nor is anything mine - remaining in this type of consciousness, one attains an extraordinary type of Tranquility.  Whoever is not stuck in Brahman and performs karma with the craving for results - he becomes suffocated in bondage.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">13) Renouncing all karma from mind -(here karma means unnecessary/meaningless action)*- residing in happiness - bring everything under [your] power.  Kutastha is in the body; its [the body’s] nine doors are open - neither does He [Kutastha] do anything nor does He cause any doing.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">14) “I am doing” - Kutastha does not say this type of thing - neither does He perform any action with the desire for results - but He is creating everything - and He is manifesting as the Highest - He has no connection with the fruits of actions - He is residing in Himself in His own “Bhava.”  “Bhava” - meaning the Tranquil Stillness beyond the three gunas - after Kriya.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">15) He did not bestow sin or beneficence on anyone at all - one becomes crystallized with sin and beneficence by not staying in the Self and looking elsewhere with attachment; thus one remains mesmerized in that - Self-awareness does not happen.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">16) Abiding in Atman causes the end of being in non-Atman, meaning looking elsewhere.  After that, continuing to remain in Atman one sees Kutastha like the sun, and His Radiant Self-Revealed True Form is manifested - this is experienced.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">17) Keeps intellect stilled in Kutastha, keeps oneself also there, in breathless stillness just lays there in That Itself - if this happens, there is no rebirth - if one always remains in Atman, one is absolved from all sins incurred by looking elsewhere.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">18) The rice of the good, educated and humble brahmin holding his container of holy water and holy grass - and the food of one who has killed a dog for his meal - seeing who these two pandits [knowledgeable ones] are as the same - meaning, for him [the sage] both are same, because, like a drunkard, no analyzing of any thing in the world remains in the par avastha of Kriya.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">19) Happiness is in this samsara itself - for one who has found equanimity/oneness - this type of consciousness is Brahman - he has no blame - same in all - his tranquil abidance is always in the Brahman-Yoni.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">20) Intellect is steadfast - is not stupid in anything - meaning from time to time attention goes in other directions - knowing Brahman, sees Brahman in all things; thus no thing is either dear or undesirable - thus there is also no mirth or anxiety.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">bahyasparsheshvasaktatma vindatyatmani yat sukham</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">sa brahmayogayuktatma sukhamakshyayamashnuhte - 21-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">21) The air from outside remains outside - it is this kind of victorious Soul who experiences such great happiness - One Bliss of Brahman - it is in That that one is embedded, with dharana, dhyan and samadhi - and goes on through time in such happiness - a happiness which has no diminution or end [indestructible] - other pleasures have certain demise.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">22) Because of “bhoga” [partaking or enjoyment of sense-matters] - that momentary bhoga that happens from engaging the mind in a direction other than vital air - before and after that bhoga is sorrow - as in sexual intercourse - birth, death - at the beginning and at the end - in both there is sorrow - wise ones do not indulge these types of karmas [partakings].</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">23) The person who can withstand [contain] the force of lust and anger before it flows out of the body - know that that is the person who is embedded in Brahman and because of that, is supremely happy.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">24) One who in his heart has attained stillness through always performing Kriya, and in whom there is a kind of Light [Jyoti] - One which is neither darkness nor light - where all manifestations are revealed (Yonimudra)* - this type of yogi, abiding in Brahman, attains Nirvana, meaning the Everlasting - continuously abiding in Brahman, mind becomes stilled in Brahman Itself.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">25) This Nirvana - sages become free of sin - meaning attention does not go in directions other than Brahman - therefore, the differentiation of “two things” does not remain - Atman becomes the One Guru - because of this happening, this kind of wish comes:  that all beings become benefited by this, meaning receive this Kriya.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">26) Not abiding in anger and lust - that sage - meaning always immersed in Brahman Itself - He remains Tranquil - in Brahman.  Knowing all to be in Atman, meaning performs Kriya.  Addicted to pranayam - disposed to Kriya.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">27) The air from outside will remain outside - eye[s] will stay amidst the eyebrows (will not blink)* - prana (pulling)** and apana (dropping)*** - both will remain equal - vayu will move in the nose.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">28) During all work, senses will remain controlled - mind and intellect - they will also be controlled - those people who are like this - they are united to liberation and are non-doers - this is what is called “jivanmukti” - liberation while alive in the body.  One who lives devoid of desire, devoid of fear and anger - he is ever free.</span> </p>
