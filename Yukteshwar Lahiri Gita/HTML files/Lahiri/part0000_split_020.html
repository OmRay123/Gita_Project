   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">2) The Royal Knowledge - secret; Great Knowledge - greatly secret; going where the mind, abiding in Brahman, becomes pure [sanctified] - fixing Kutastha in front of the eye, easy realization of dharma is happening without desire. Meaning - Kriya, which is transmitted via Guru and in wonderful ease and happiness - can be done in Kali.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">ashraddadhanah purusha dharmasyasya parantapa aprapya mam nivartante mrityusamsaravartmani - 3-</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">3) The person who does not abide in Brahman and does not perform this Kriya - thus does not attain me - not attaining, becoming disengaged from Atman, putting attachment-filled attention on other things, for the sake of the enjoyment of sensory objects - meaning, performing action with the craving for results and doing such business of give and take - for the fulfillment of such enjoyment, birth and death happens to him.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">4) Then he cannot comprehend anything at all of this world - at that time, I am in all - it is in Me that they reside - I do not reside in all - meaning, they are in Me, but I am not in them.  In the way that [it is true that] all reside in Atman, for sure - but not seeing Atman, they are not in It.  Because attention is on other things - not on the breath.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">5) My Form is Ishvar - looking elsewhere instead of towards Him - put your sight above this itself - so that this type of thing does not happen - meaning, do not look elsewhere - even while residing in the midst of all - in all conditions and circumstances - all phenomena are presently existing, yet not in Me - the restless mind is engaged in looking elsewhere instead of toward Atman.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">7) All phenomena go via the eight aspects - as soon as any karma is completed, they again become engaged in other karma.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">8) Caught in those aspects - again and again, meaning - desire happens - for this reason, birth and death occur again and again - but the sense organs of the five elements - those elements are bound by those sense organs - in the case of all of the sense organs - Prakriti, meaning - while residing in the body, it is extremely difficult to keep under control that which keeps the body itself completely bound - therefore, all the sense organs from that very house - they also do not remain under control - but if Kriya is performed, they do [remain under control].</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">9) All karma of Prakriti is also happening under the control held by the sense organs - but I am apart from all such karma - all such karma cannot bind Me - because I am residing in My Self Itself - sitting on top of the head - or - sitting there and not having attention in other directions like everyone else, there is no attachment to other things - I am residing in Atman Itself - thus, attached to Atman.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">10) I, with intelligence - in this body - meaning - with attention on Prakriti, am in the mobile and the immobile - thus, the world is moving in the road going in the opposite direction - the cause of such is this:  the branches and leaves are below - the root is on top of the head.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">avajananti mam mudha manushim tanumashritam param bhavamajananto mama bhutamaheshvaram - 11-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">11) The ignorant ones have absolutely concluded that I am human, [without knowing] My Supreme Essence - meaning, without knowing the Stillness of Kriya - I am the Supreme Substance, Brahman Itself.  There is no destruction of Me and neither do I have birth!!!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">moghasha moghakarmano moghajnana vichetasah rakshasimasurim chaiva prakritim mohinim shritah - 12-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">12) He is the one who wastes action - whoever does not abide in Atman and does not witness Kutastha - seeing a very little bit, is greedy after other things - does not perform Kriya and goes on being obstinate.  (Kutastha is Itself - Purusha; the Manifest Light).*</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">13) One to whom this type of Knowledge has happened - that all creation is filled with Brahman and that Prakriti is within Brahman - meaning, the work of the five elements - it is to This that they keep refuge.  At the beginning of all phenomena - meaning, the six chakras - is Brahman- knowing the Indestructible.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">satatam kirtayanto mam yatantashcha dhriravratah namasyantashcha mam bhaktya nityayukta upasate - 14-</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">14) Devotional songs which are verily Mine [alt.: verily to Me] - meaning Kriya - shutting eyes and ears, being totally absorbed, prostrating to me by Omkar Kriya, having faith in the teachings of Guru and always remaining ensconced - sitting above.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">jnanayajnena chapyanye yajanto mamupasate ekatvena prithaktvena bahudha vishvatomukham - 15-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">15) Some perform both Yonimudra and Kriya - both are one - many types of Kriya - the purpose of all of them is one.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">16) (Aham krtu and aham yajna)* verily, I am the doer - the doer of yajna - to do yajna - the act of yajna is also verily Me - I am also the par avastha of Kriya - I am medicine also, because in that there is Brahman - there is no other medicine besides abiding in Brahman.  I am mantra - meaning, it is when oneself remains in the Self that the mind finds life - that possibility comes through transmission via Guru.  The ghee for oblation is Me - I am fire - It is to Me that oblation is done.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">17) I am the Grandfather Brahman - the world’s - meaning, all active things - all of those have emerged from Me and I am sustaining them, and I am everyone’s Grandpa, [the knowledge of] which is transmitted via Guru - I am that which is to be known - on the earth there is nothing comparable that is as pure as Me - It is with Me that Omkar is the form of this body.  Rik, Sama, Yaju - the three becoming together make Atharva. These four directions are My Form.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">gatirbharta prabhuh sakshi nivasah sharanam suhrit prabhavah pralayah sthanam nidhanam bijamavyayam - 18-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">18) I am the Way - I am the Lord of life maintenance - I have become a single person in My small part - It is in Me that everyone resides - I am the one that everyone is to remember - meaning, everyone should meditate upon Me - when the body is beautifully proper, there is revelation - It from Me that everyone is manifesting completely - meaning, arising is from My Mind and complete dissolution is in That Itself - “nidhanam” = the place for everyone to be in their Tranquil True Self - the place of emergence for all - meaning, the Seed Brahman.  That has no destruction.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">tapamyahamaham varsham nigrihnamyutsrijami cha amritam chaiva mrityushcha sadasacchahamarjuna - 19-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">19) [Not] by desire - meaning not doing it continuously in the mind, creation happens - when persons come upon this kind of ability - then the sight is upon Immortality.  That is Itself Brahman!!! Dying is My form - because there is no liberation unless there is dying while being alive.  I am the good, and I am the bad as well.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">traividya mam somapah putapapa yajnairishtva svargatim prarthayante te punyamasadya surendraloka mashnanti divyandivi devabhogan - 20-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">20) In this body - the form of Omkar - the three “vidyas” [wisdoms or sciences] - knowing - the Form is Mine.  The tongue-knot, heart-knot - Muladhar knot - piercing [breaking or cutting] and the vision of the full moon - that is also My Form - the place where if one goes, one is purified - this yajna is [true] yajna - going here is the Path of Truth - in that sanctity - performing the good karma of oneself, the sense - meaning the eye, who [which] is premier among all - it is He who is Kutastha - becoming oneself, witnesses the star in Himself, by which many kinds of Divine Revelations and enjoyment of Bliss are happening in this body.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">te tam bhuktva svargalokam vishalam kshine punye martalokam vishanti evam trayidharmamanuprapanna gatagatam kamakama labhante - 21-</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">21) After the rewards of good are used up, they again return from the heavenly plane to the earthly plane - in this way, practicing the give-and-take dharma of religion, material wealth and physical pleasure, whatever is desired by whoever, they acquire such.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">ananyashchintayanto mam ye janah paryupasate tesham nityabhiyuktanam yogakshemam vahamyaham - 22-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">22) Whoever remains in Atman without putting attention in other directions - remaining lodged every day - that which will bring about beneficence from their samadhi - I make that arise spontaneously within.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">23) Whoever meditates reverently upon other gods besides Atman - without completely stilling oneself - it is upon Me that he meditates - because the attention of his mind is for a while upon that god itself - but does not completely still his mind and remain - “vidhi” - meaning, perfectly remaining in intelligence is called “vidhi.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">aham hi sarvayajnanam bhokta cha prabhureva cha na tu mamabhijananti tatvenatashchyavanti te - 24-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">24) I am the enjoyer of all yajnas - “yajna” meaning karma [actions].  It is I who am truly manifesting - those who do not perform Kriya - meaning - not being in the five elements and not abiding in the sixth chakra - they cannot completely know Me.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">25) If one meditates upon gods, one attains gods - if one meditates upon the subtle plane, one attains the subtle plane - if one meditates upon the phenomenal plane, one attains the phenomenal plane - if one meditates upon Me, one attains Me.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">patram pushpam phalam toyam yo me bhaktya prayacchati tadaham bhaktyupahritamashnami prayatatmanah - 26-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">26) The leaf of the “bel” tree - flowers, fruits, water - whosoever offers such to Me with faith in Guru’s words, I receive all of that - but offering while completely in samadhi - knowing the false as true - as when trying to get rid of an ailment one says, “say it is not there,” and again, “say it is not there” - but the one who is saying such is saying so knowing that it is false, but with the intention of making it true - in that way, knowing all of the works of this world (worship, almanacs)* to be false, they call it true and do such.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">27) Whatever you are consuming, whatever you are giving and the rites that you are performing, offer all of it to Me - meaning, Brahman is Itself doing the acts of Brahman - I am not doing it - this is what is known as offering [“arpan”].  Not knowing all of the time that I am that Brahman - meaning, if Knowledge of this type which comes about spontaneously from continuous performance of Kriya is not there - then offering of this type does not happen - who - offers to whom - Brahman offers to Brahman Itself - meaning, Eternal Stillness Manifested.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">shubhashubhaphalairevam mokshase karmabandhanaih sannyasayogayuktatma vimukto mamupaishyasi - 28-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">28) Doing so in this way, one becomes liberated from the results of good and bad - meaning - one is no longer in the bondage of performing actions with the desire for results - not desiring any thing when attention falls upon it, being in samadhi - remaining lodged - being completely liberated - meaning, being Still, worships Me - meaning, abides on top of the head.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">samohham sarbhuteshu na me dveshyohsti na priyah ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya mayi te teshu chapyaham - 29-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">29) I preside in all phenomena equally - the way that the thread is the same throughout the garlanded bunch - neither do I hate anything, nor do I love anything - one who meditates upon Me with devotion - meaning, performs Kriya - I also meditate upon him - meaning, abiding within him, I also perform Kriya.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">30) Not abiding in the Infinite Brahman - one who performs evil practices - if he abides in Atman with one pointed mind - he should be regarded as a sadhu - thoroughly persevering - meaning, even if he performs acts with the craving for results.</span> </p>
