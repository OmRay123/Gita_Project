   <p class="calibre57"> <span class="calibre3">1) Dharma kshetre = Meaning, dharma is compassion towards the elements, through which the jiva is saved. This karma [work] is called “Akarmokarma” [action by non-doing] - proof - “karmanyakarma yah. sa buddhiman manushyeshu sa yuktah kritsna karmakrit.” Meaning, the action that is done without desire for results, that work which is received from Guru; because of this, life is lengthened and therefore the body is saved; this is called compassion. By first saving one’s own body, one gets the ability to save others’ bodies. This form is Dharmakshetra. Kshetra = the body - the proof of this is in this Gita itself (idam shariram kaunteya kshetramityabhidhiyate). Meaning, this body which is for doing Kriya, where the jivatman (individual soul) and the Paramatman (Supreme Soul ) manifesting in full Grace and Glory and the five elements are on one side - meaning the five Pandavas - Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva - meaning space, air, fire, water, earth. Yudhisthira, being space, for this reason merged this ether into the beyond-ether, meaning, went to heaven while in the body. Bhima is air. The proof is in the Mahabharata (khacharasya sutasya sutah khacharah,...khachari pariroditi ha khachar). Arjuna is Indra’s son. “i” = power. “ndra” = fire. The one whose power is like fire. This is why lightning is called Indrayudh. [Nakul =] Na kul [banks] shores - shores cannot be found in water. Sahadeva is the son of Earth. For this reason, he is aged in the Vedic scriptures - this is mentioned in the Mahabharata.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre57"> <span class="calibre3">Kurukshetre - In the field of this body are five senses of perception and five senses of action. These ten senses going in ten directions are the mind’s one hundred children. Their names are explained extensively in the first section and written within the body, in the line of battle. The meanings of their names and their related activities represent that they are all working towards things of wicked propensity. From below the navel to the Muladhar is descent. The inert, hence Kuru = on the wicked side - what is my group - Maya, the five elements as Pandavas - doing? Sanjaya - the definition of Sanjaya is - subtle inner sight - meaning, what is the experience from meditating on Brahman - this the mind wants to know. Whatever is being revealed by subtle inner sight, he is stating that in stillness. </span> </p>

Alambusha - in the right eye; in the left eye - Pushpanasha. On the right Pingala, in the middle Sushumna, on the left Ida, in the tongue Saraswati, in the lingam = Baruni in the Muladhar, Kuhu at the door of the anus - the currents of all these nadis are the forms of soldiers - if there is no river, what kind of current is possible; their names as mentioned in the scriptures and such - I am writing sequentially. 1: Ida - Ganga - 2: Pingala - Yamuna - 3: Gandhari - Kaveri - 4: Hastini - Sindhu - 5: Pusha - Tamraparni - 6: Alambusha - Gautami - 7-8: Sushumna - Saraswati - 9: Kuhu - Narmada - 10-11: Baruni - Gomati - 12: Payasvini - Punpuna.

In some popular versions, the asterisked point marks the completion of the 26th sloka. In this version of the Gita, the sloka is not completed until the next line. Therefore, in some Gitas, the total number of slokas in the first chapter is 47, whereas in this version of the Gita, the total number of slokas is 46. However, the total text in either type of the Gita is the same. There are no omissions. The apparent unevenness of this sloka 26 is balanced out in sloka number 36, being another three-line sloka.
