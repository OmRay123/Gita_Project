   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">1) The experience continued through the subtle perception: Then the energy of the body, feeling and expressing sympathy towards himself, remained in his mind and went on analyzing [about the merit of] slaying the long-standing relatives and family [which are] sense-activities and such, through whom oneself has enjoyed so much so thoroughly. Because of this, he became sorrowful within and his eyes became filled with tears, by which - in shambles from melancholy - he began to express himself internally to Kutastha Brahman, the destroyer of this kind of demon of Maya.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">2) It is being revealed via Kutastha: By looking at things everywhere else and being attached to that, this tremendous sin that has come upon you - this is not the work of those who abide in Brahman, and there is no happiness in this [attachment to senses etc.] either. Not abiding in Kutastha will cause whatever malevolent things to happen.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">3) Like a eunuch, neither on this side nor on that side, meaning not even being only covered in samsara, because from time to time even extreme evil-doers think about God, and neither being in Atman all the time - not being like that also, because from time to time the attention goes out to worldly attachment - for you this is not appropriate action - those who are of low character and those who have no desire to anything good - they are the ones who act in this way - therefore renounce this - renouncing it, remain above - when that happens, that is when you will always abide in Kutastha.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">6) I do not see good in either victory or defeat - all those that are alive in front of me - I do not wish to kill them and live.

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">7) I am very miserly, because I crave results from every action. I do not give one penny to anyone without expectation of something, thus, the actualization of craving results - which is the mind being attentive elsewhere, meaning that I have destroyed the absorption in Atman, meaning Stillness, thus I cannot know what type of thing dharma is - for this reason I am asking - similar to a stupid (good)* person - stupid because of this: I cannot keep the mind steady in the chitta within - what is good amongst these, meaning remaining with the senses or vanquishing them - tell me that which is good, meaning make me experience it, because I am a disciple, meaning that I always perform Kriya, and I lay always at Your Feet, meaning Kriya itself.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">9) It is being experienced by the subtle perception: The energy of the body expressed this feeling to Kutastha and sat down, saying, “I will not perform Kriya.”</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">10) Kutastha ecstatically spoke out. During this time before the commencement of Kriya with the thought occurring - should I do or should I not, both of them were in the midst of the two sides.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">11) No one should not grieve over matters which are not worthy of grief - this is what the wise ones have said. Knowledgeable ones do not grieve over that which is gone, neither do those who see with clarity and impartiality.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">12) Neither is there death for you, nor is there death for me - meaning that Kutastha is as He is, because He is Eternal. Matter and Nature are also Him, and He is that Brahman Being; He also has no birth or death. Therefore, all these royalty (senses and such)* that you see - they are also Brahman and without birth and death. What you are seeing is not what it is - this is only bubbles forming in water. Water is like Brahman; the bubble also exists from that water as a mutation caused by a quality called air. In this way know all beings - nothing is happening - beyond this all things are Brahman.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">13) Who is the Dweller in the body but Kutastha - The One Who is Kutastha Brahman, as He is, so He is. The body is going through childhood, adulthood and old age - similar to a water-bubble’s beginning condition, middle condition, and destruction at the final condition. Those who are abiding with still minds in that water-illustrated Brahman - they do not become deluded by such mutations.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">14) The quintelemental body, meaning, earth, water, fire, air, ether, Muladhar, Svadhishthan, Manipur, Anahata, Vishuddhakhya, the “A” , the “U”, the “M”, Nada, Bindu. Touch, meaning experiencing these by vayu - and being in existence and dissolution, beyond these is Kutastha Brahman - where the Ajna Chakra is - when vayu is stilled - boundless - sound stopped - Bindu, Nada, quarter-moon-zodiac-time-all aspects of things, future and the Beyond is known - it is He about Whom the scriptures such as the Vedas speak. There is a kind of Bliss there [Supreme Bliss] which is called Paramananda, immersing in which there is profound intoxication - thus, when one does not contact the limited [sense-world etc.], one is without pleasure and pain; when one contacts the limited, one is with pleasure and pain. It is by this contact one experiences; observe this (titikshu = look).</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">yam hi na vyathayantyete purusham purusharshabha samaduhkhasukham dhiram sohmritatvaya kalpate - 15-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">15) That is the “rishi”, meaning the Supreme Person Brahman - He is beyond all - the vayu is still there - one who has attained the Still Vayu, meaning dead body - no pain happens to that. In that way, no pain happens to that Kutastha at all - and a dead body has no pleasure or sorrow, is lying still - in that way, Kutastha also has no pleasure or pain - Still!!! but Immortal!!! Those who have attained this are called “gods.” Thus, gods are immortal. One whose third eye, meaning Divine Eye, has merged in Kutastha - they are the ones who are “jivanmukta” while in this body, and therefore immortal.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">nasato vidyate bhavo nabhavo vidyate satah ubhayorapi drishtohntastvanayostatvadarshibhih - 16-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">16) If, in the body - which is the manifestation of Omkar, one does not perform pulling and dropping, he is not able to know Stillness. One who does not have this condition - he does not stay in his own body; thus whether at home or abroad, there is trouble (you can plainly see it). The state beyond these two - then there are no words - going beyond matter one becomes the witness of the Supreme Substance, meaning - one becomes a knower of Brahman.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">17) Tat is but Kutastha - He is Indestructible - no one is capable of destroying Him, because He is Omnipresent - who will destroy whom - because of Whom this entire existence is.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">antavantaime deha nityasyoktah sharirinah anashinohprameyasya tasmad yudhyasva bharata - 18-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">18) The body has its demise just as a bubble also has its demise. As long as there is air, there is existence - then death - but the water-exemplifying Brahman has no death because He is Indestructible - and there is no comparison to Him either. If there were some substance other than Brahman, then there could be comparison, isn’t it? Thus, that which is your work to perform, go on doing it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">ya enam vetti hantaram yashchainam manyate hatam ubhou tou na vijanito nayam hanti na hanyate - 19-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">19) The One that you are perceiving as the slayer - He is Kutastha Brahman! The One you are imagining to be slain - He is also Brahman!! You do not know these two things - no one slaying at all, no one is being slain at all.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">na jayate mriyate va kadachin- nayam bhutva bhavita va na bhuyah ajo nityah shvashvatohyam purano na hanyate hanyamane sharire - 20-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">20) He has no birth because he is Eternal, all-pervading - where is there any place to be born - where is death for Eternal Substance? All is Brahman!! Then how can one thing be changed [mutated or affected] by another thing? This can never happen - that which you are seeing as happening - that is just a image-form which is false - that will also dissolve into Brahman. Being and not being for that are the same; when being and not being are the same, and even has not been, then how can it be? Nothing has happened from anything. Because the Unborn/Self-Born Brahman is the Eternal Primordial Person - He Himself does not slay - because by what shall He slay? That by which He will slay - in that is also Brahman - the One He will slay - He is also Brahman - therefore, how will Brahman kill Brahman? This body - its destruction is continuously happening, but how can the destroyable destroy the Indestructible?</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">21) Veda, meaning that by which one can know; they have said - the Indestructible, meaning that the one who has known, has known the Indestructible and has gone to the Eternal Substance - Brahman. He has no birth, nor death - how can one kill Him - by saying “I will kill”?</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">22) The Supreme Person discards old clothes in the form of this body and puts on new clothes in the form of [another] body.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">23) There is no possibility of cutting Kutastha with a weapon, because the Void that emerges from That - nothing is cut by flailing a sword at that - in that way, vayu becomes still in the body - Kutastha - how can He be cut? That Kutastha cannot be burned by fire, cannot be wetted and soiled by water, cannot be dried by air; this is clear - the realization of this can come about by taking initiation in Kriya! (It can be known by the Grace of Guru.)</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">24) Thus It is impenetrable, inflammable, cannot be wetted and soiled, cannot be dried, Eternal, lying within all, meaning - is residing in the form of the essence - unmoving - the Universal Form.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">25) One cannot speak about Him by the mouth - can only realize by oneself. There is no way of thinking [about That] because if that happens, then there is two - there is no possibility of change [mutation] because He is in all - knowing this, there is no need to grieve over anything.</span> </p>
