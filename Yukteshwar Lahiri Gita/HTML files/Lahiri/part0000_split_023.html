   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">Arjuna said:</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">1) The energy of the body is saying - those who are always locked [stuck] in this way - having performed Kriya and having had faith in Guru’s teaching - and those who worship Kutastha, meaning perform Yonimudra - what that is, there is no way of saying - among them, who is the superior yogi?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">Sri Bhagavan said:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">mayyaveshya mano ye mam nityayukta upasate</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">shraddhaya parayopetaste me yuktatama matah - 2-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">2) It is being experienced via Kutastha - the mind becomes enraptured after Kriya - by being always lodged in Tranquility - worships - one who remains lodged - it is he who is good.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">3) Those who abide in Kutastha - wherever he goes, he sees Kutastha in that very place, and in all matters, contemplates the Inconceivable Brahman in the form of Kutastha - being still and with complete certainty.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">4) Controlling all senses by extinguishing, and keeping everything in equilibrium - sees - keeping intellect stilled - he certainly attains Me, and he does that which benefits all beings - meaning teaches Kriya - it is in this that his mind always dwells.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">5) One who does not abide in Kutastha - he becomes very afflicted - because the Unmanifest Brahman is attained by embodied beings through struggle.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">ye tu sarvani karmani mayi sannyasya matparah</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">ananyenaiva yogena mam dhyayanta upasate - 6-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">6) Those who have extinguished all actions and the desire for their fruits in Me - it is My Kriya, verily - knowing via the transmission of Guru, abides in Me - not putting attention elsewhere, becoming immersed in samadhi, does My Kriya - meaning, doing pranayam 1728 times, worships.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">7) I take him from the death-samsara and, with Tranquility, I lift him up on top of the head - quickly, he becomes “I” - those who abide in the par avastha of Kriya and remain lodged.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">8) It is Me where the mind should be kept - meaning, having stilled the intellect in the par avastha of Kriya, enter it with extinguished silence - after penetrating with extinguished silence in this way he will definitely become “I” - with infallible certainty - and will go above - meaning, he will abide sitting on top of the head - there is no doubt about this.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">atha chittam samadhatum na shaknoshi mayi sthiram</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">abhyasayogena tato mamicchaptum dhananjaya - 9-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">9) If not able to still the mind in Me, then you should desire to practice - meaning, increase Kriya.</span> </p>

   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">10) If you do not have the strength or time to practice, then perform My karma [act] - meaning, action without the desire for its fruits - meaning, as one continues with the performance of Kriya, desire for all things will end - that is what is known as the attainment of “siddhi.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">athaitadapyashaktohsi kartum madyogamashritah</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">sarvakarmaphalatyagam tatah kuru yatatmavan - 11-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">11) If you cannot become immersed and do even this, then perform all of the different kinds of actions - but without the desire for results, and enjoined with Atman - meaning, being in dharana, dhyan and samadhi.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">shreyo hi jnanamabhyasajjnanaddhvyanam vishishyate</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">dhyanam karmaphalatyagastyagacchantiranantaram - 12-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">12) Besides Yonimudra, doing pranayam 1728 times is good; other than that, always performing Kriya without the desire for results is good; and beyond that, neither am I anything, and nor is anything mine - that which happens in the par avastha of Kriya - good.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">adveshta sarvabhutanam maitrah karuna eva cha</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">nirmamo nirahamkarah samaduhkhasukhah kshami - 13-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">13) Do not hate anyone - what is enmity for drunkards? See everyone as yourself in the form of the Kutastha and do that which will elevate Kriya - I am nothing, nothing is mine - just by the work of staying in the par avastha of Kriya, the ego is not there at that time - sorrow and happiness are known as the same in intoxication - if someone says something, he is forgiven by stating “let him say it” - meaning, does not care about it, like a door squeaking “k(n)yatch k(n)oatch.”*</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[*Translator’s note: The “n”s in the last two words indicate the nasal quality of the squeaking door, and these words are transliterations from the original.]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">santushtah satatam yogi yatatma dridhanishchayah</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">mayarpitamanobuddhiryo me bhaktah sa me priyah - 14-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">14) Always - content at heart - spontaneously by itself in the abidance in the par avastha of Kriya - because oneself is lodged completely and securely - whoever has stilled his mind after Kriya and has surrendered it to Me - meaning, does not put attachment-filled attention on other things - that state, which happens by itself - where he stills and surrenders the intellect - which also happens by itself - one whose faith in the teachings of Guru has become like this - he is dear to Me - meaning, besides this, he absolutely knows nothing else at all.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">yasmannodvijate loko lokannodvijate cha yah</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">harshamarshabhayodvegairmukto yah sa cha me priyah - 15-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">15) The one from whom no harm comes to any person - and the one by whose work people are not disturbed - sorrow and pleasure, fear and anxiety - which never at all happens to drunkards - in that way, the “jivanmukta” person who resides in the par avastha of Kriya - the one who remains as the Self in the bliss of the Self is the Self who is dear to the Self.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">anapekshah shuchirdaksha udasino gatavyathah</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">sarvarambhaparityagi yo madbhaktah sa me priyah - 16-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">16) Does not look in any other direction - does not have desire for that either - always remains in Brahman - abiding in the paravastha of Kriya, sees Kutastha in all and as the expert in every kind of work - sitting on top of the head and abiding there, remains devoid of any kind of affliction.  When there is desire for non-essential karma [action] - at the very beginning of that desire, because of abiding in Brahman - via the absolute intoxication - [the desire] is discarded by itself [automatically], because those pleasures are momentary, after which there is no happiness - abiding in the par avastha of Kriya - is partaking - one who has attained the state of being at this kind of level via the teaching of Guru - he is the Self through whose own actions is dear to the Self.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">yo na hrishyati na dveshti na shochati na kankshati</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">shubhashubhaparityagi bhaktiman yah sa me priyah - 17-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">17) The one who, abiding in the par avastha of Kriya, is not pleased at anything - is not hateful about anything - does not desire - renouncing both good and bad - which happens automatically to drunkards - having received this type of Kriya via the teaching of Guru - in the work of the Self Itself - the Self is dear to Itself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">samah shatrou cha mitre cha tatha manapamanayoh</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">shitoshnasukhaduhkheshu samah sangavivarjitah - 18-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">18) Like a drunkard residing in the par avastha of Kriya, is not aware of anyone being an enemy or friend - honor and dishonor is also not there for him - cold, heat, pleasure, sorrow - all are just the same; desire does not go to any matters of the senses.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">tulyanindastutinmouni santushto yena kenachit</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">aniketah sthiramatirbhaktimanme priyo narah - 19-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">19) Condemnation and praise - both of these do not happen without petitioning - therefore, knowing both as the most trivial and lowest, does not desire to say any words at all - whatever has happened or been received - is content with just that - does not reside in his own home - meaning, resides in Brahman - inclinations become Tranquil automatically in the par avastha of Kriya - having received this type of Kriya via the teaching of Guru, completely becoming Still by itself [automatically], is dear to Brahman.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre16">ye tu dharmyamritamidam yathoktam paryupasate</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre16">shraddadhana matparama bhaktastehtiva me priyah - 20-</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">[Commentary:]</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">20) This dharma - meaning Kriya without desire - it is in this that you will receive Immortal Substance - the one who performs Kriya in this way and resides above - abiding in Brahman - only Atman Itself is beyond everything - knowing this very thing - meaning having been initiated in Kriya via the teaching of Guru, and doing it [practicing] with faith - the one who comes to know this Supreme Substance automatically by himself, resides in secure Tranquility in the Bliss of Brahman.  Thus, the one who wishes to attain the Knowledge of Brahman - he should perform this Kriya.</span> </p>
