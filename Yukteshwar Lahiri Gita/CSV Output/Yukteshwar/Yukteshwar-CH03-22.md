Commentary: There is nothing in these physical, subtle and causal bodies that Consciousness does not possess nor is anything unattainable for It; therefore, It does not even need to perform any type of action in order to acquire anything.  Thus, Consciousness-Shakti is present in all karma [work]. - 22-
