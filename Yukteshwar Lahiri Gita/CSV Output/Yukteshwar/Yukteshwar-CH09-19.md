Commentary: That Infinite Consciousness Itself cools the world by rain from clouds, and it is He Who magnetizes as the sun and heats the world; it is He Who is the life and death, Lord of creation and Lord of destruction of this world; more than that, it is only He Who is residing in this unsubstantial, temporary and insignificant created matter which has emerged from that Beginingless, Eternal Substance. - 19-
