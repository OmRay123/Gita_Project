### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: In previous commentaries it has been explained that sadhakas call the upper part of this body as “north” and the lower part of this body as “south”; and in the 69th sloka of the second chapter it has been stated that because at the time of the awakened state of the phenomenal world - meaning the day-part of Brahma - Atman-Consciousness is covered by a corrupted state, the sadhakas of Self-Knowledge perceive that time to be “night”; and at the time which is the night-part of Brahma - because at this time the entire phenomenal world is dissolved and Atman-Consciousness is revealed in Totality, the sadhakas of Self-Knowledge perceive this time as “day.” Now the meaning of this sloka is this: the time when Consciousness-Self, as Fiery Energy and as Radiant Light, having annihilated the elemental aggregates, pierces through the six chakras and rises above - that is the time which is the most excellent. It is at that time that Brahman-realized sadhakas discard their bodies and become the Beingness of Infinite Consciousness. All those sadhakas who, being attached to the fulfillment of desire, have been unable to dissolve the aggregate of elements and thus have been unable to realize Atman-Consciousness - they become covered with the darkness of illusion, and at the time of leaving the body, unconsciously descend through the six chakras, because of which thoughts of sense-objects arise, and they again take birth in samsara. - 24 and 25-
