### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Those who by Sadguru’s instructions take refuge in the immovable, this Brahman-embodied-in-all elements, Universe-pervading Consciousness and reside in that, they, no matter where they are in whatever way they are, are always residing in the Consciousness-State. Nothing of creation is able to make them unconscious. - 31-
