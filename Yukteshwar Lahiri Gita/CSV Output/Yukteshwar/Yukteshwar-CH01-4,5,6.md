### Commentary

[no poetical version in the original] Commentary: It is written in the Patanjal shastra that those who, through the power of discrimination, see the world as an illusion and keep themselves in only Soul-Consciousness, and those who, experiencing the Universe as the Brahman-Itself, experience themselves as pervading the Universe - the sages in these states attain Kaivalya by themselves, without the aid of anyone or anything.  But for the ordinary rest, in order to attain that state it is necessary to have the help of reverence, vigor, memory, absorption, inner knowledge and such methods, and by using speedy force to manifest these, the work is accomplished rapidly. As in - In the Patanjal Yogasutra Samadhipada: bhavapratyayo videhaprakritilayanam - no. 19 sraddhaviryasmritisamadhiprajnapurvakamitaresham - no. 20 tivrasambeganamasannah - no. 21 Along with these:  yama, niyama, asana, pranayam, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, samadhi - when the impurity-dispelling knowledge is illuminated through the technique of this eight-limbed yoga, discrimination is established and the cause of all harm - ignorance - is destroyed, and by this Kaivalya is attained.  As in - In Patanjal Yogasutra Sadhanapada: tasya heturvidya - no. 24 tadbhavat samyogobhavo hanantaddrishyeh kaivalyam - no. 25 vivekakhyatirviplava hanopaya - no. 26 yoganganushthanajashuddhikshaye jnanadiptiravivaka khyateh - no. 28 yamaniyamasana-pranayama-pratyahara-dharana-dhyana-samadhayorshtavangani -no.29 Now, if we leave the outer form, the method mentioned by Patanjal is revealed in these three slokas.  As in - yuyudhan (in the battle, meaning the desire to do the Consciousness-revealing Kriya) reverence. uttamouja (excellent vigor, meaning fire-endowed) vigor. chekitan (consciousness, the substance of which is knowing) memory. birat (to prevail in the Soul, meaning becoming immersed) absorption. kashiraj (the one who is revealed after having revealed the world) inner knowledge. drupada (endowed with fast motion) speedy force. dhrishtaketu (technique to destroy harm) yama. ahimsasatyasteya brahmacharyaparigrahah yamah. - Patanjal Sadhanapada - no. 5 When ahimsa [physical and mental non-meanness or non-violence (mental and physical)] is manifested, meaning when no meanness ever arises in ones mind, then these types of people have no enmity with anyone.  Violent and aggressive animals such as tigers and bears remain docile towards these beings.  When meanness and aggression are forgotten for life, a beautiful radiance arises whose qualities of trustworthiness and deep contentment are seen in the eyes of and experienced by even violent and aggressive animals.  Thus, not even a hint of aggression arises in their minds.  This is written in the Mahabharata.  As in - abhayam sarvabhutebhyo datva yashchayate munih na tasya sarvabhutetya bhayamutpadyate kvachit shaiva (the beneficent) niyama. shouchasantoshatapah svadhyayeshvana pranidhanani niyamah kuntibhoja (the state in which one can attract divine powers) asana. yudhamanyu (battle, meaning the one whose Kriya is the revelation of Consciousness) pranayam. purujit (meaning the one who is victorious over the god of the senses) pratyahara. soubhadra abhimanyu (the revealer of all divine manifestations) the union of dharana, dhyana and samadhi, meaning samyama. trayamekatra samyama -  Patanjal Bibhutipada - no. 4 And the kulakundalini shakti, united with the five elements manifests the five points, by which the mind becomes absorbed.  These extremely powerful faculties, as in the air element, fire element and such, in steadfast faith are presiding with great might. -  4, 5, and 6 -
