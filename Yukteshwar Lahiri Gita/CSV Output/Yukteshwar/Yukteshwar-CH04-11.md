### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: In accordance with the reverence and devotion with which one performs Kriya will be the quality of the revelation of Consciousness. The great Sadguru-initiated sadhaka Tulsidas’ couplets also contain this statement. As in - [Hindi] Ram jharokhe bayeth kar savko majura ley jaysa jako chakri taysa tako dey [Lord Ram sits at the window receiving all workers As one’s work is, so is the remuneration is given] The all-pervading Consciousness resides within everyone as the Witness and bestows realization according to the work done. Surrendering life and mind to the Kutasthachaitanya and keeping in mind this understanding of Atman-Consciousness, the sadhakas take refuge in this Consciousness-revealing Kriya yoga. - 11-
