### Commentary

Commentary: Those who offer oblations, give charity and perform austerities without reverence - they [and their works] are called “asat” [with no basis on Truth or goodness]. - 28- Thus ends the seventeenth chapter named “Shraddhatrayayoga.”* *[Translator’s note: The author has used a less compounded form of the title at the beginning of the chapter.]
