### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: According to the prarabdha acquired because of seeking different kinds of happiness, human beings become imbued with sattva, raja etc. and many qualities and are thereby separated into the four varnas [forms] of “brahmin,” “kshatriya,” “vaishya,” and “sudra.” As in - human beings dominated by sattva guna and living in the state of Eternal Consciousness are called “brahmin”; sattvic-rajoguna-predominant human beings who are engaged in battle of performing the evil-tendency-destroying, Consciousness-revealing Kriya are called “kshatriya”; tamasic-rajoguna-predominant human beings, who are concerned with the upliftment of the bodily field and thus are involved in scriptural study and following rituals, are called “vaishya”; and tamoguna-predominant human beings, the ignorant ones always in the service of the senses, are called “sudras.” Although it is because of the quest of Consciousness-ecstasy that such conditions occur, Consciousness does not preside more or less over any such states. Consciousness is Eternal-Substance and is present the same in every place and condition. And neither is the Supreme Consciousness the Creator of these small sovereignties - it is only because of the fluctuations of the external dressing that make it seem as if the Consciousness is manifesting moore or less and thus giving emergence to the many different varnas. Just as the phantasmagoric shadow play [cinema] from the increase and decrease of light seems to cause many kinds of events, the light or lamp is not involved in any of the action and cannot be called as their creator - the many different, changing conditions of the covering in front of the light is making the events seem to happen - in the same way, although these varnas have come about because of the gradation of Consciousness-realization, that Eternal Consciousness is not their Creator. This is happening because of the fluctuations in the covering over Consciousness in the form of ignorance and unawareness. - 13-
