### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: By researching the science of creation one can know that from the gods to mobile and immobile matter, all things are following their own nature and are being created accordingly in new and different forms. And being bound to such nature, one form is being discarded and again a new one is being created. But Atman-Consciousness is eternal and immutable, and is present in the same way everywhere. This has been clearly explained in previous slokas of this book. Now, it is being revealed in sloka that the beneficent or maleficent works by the Prakriti-deviation-culture of body, mind, intellect and sensory functions are affecting in their various ways only the nature of jivas. No diminution or expansion happens to the Atman-Consciousness by this. It is eternal and immutable. Ignorance, meaning Prakriti, is not in Consciousness and is engaged in acquiring externally. From such deviation many types of things have arisen and they are keeping the Consciousness in the form of Knowledge in jivas covered in stupor. Because of this, jivas have become deluded, and unable to realize this, they are bound to this worldly life. - 15-
