Commentary: In this way, those who are able to experience that Eternal Bliss-of-Knowledge-filled Infinite Consciousness as the Lord of the quintelemental physical body, the subtle body and all works - they are the ones who, because of always residing in Atman-Consciousness, experience that Infinite Consciousness at the time of leaving the body and remain filled with Eternal Bliss. - 30- SUMMARIZED DESCRIPTION OF CHAPTER 7 If mind is absorbed in Kutashta in the previously mentioned way, it is known that there are very few people in the world who take care to attain the revelation of Consciousness-Self; rarely is there one who is able to do that. How that person comes to know that Glorious Infinite Consciousness and thereby becomes aware of all things in the Universe is being explained [1-3]. Creation, samsara - all - having been constructed by a small, material-Prakriti aspect - these eight types of essences: earth, water, fire, air, ether, mana, buddhi and ahamkar - of that Infinite Consciousness, are existing as alive because of being imbued with another Supremely High Prakriti of Consciousness. Both of these Prakritis have emerged from that Infinite Consciousness, and they also dissolve in That; there is nothing greater in the Cosmos beyond That; like jewels strung on thread, this Cosmos is existing on That [4-7]. This Kutasthachaitanya makes all physical elements appear in creation. It is present in that as sound, as radiance in the presiding lords of the subtle world, such as the sun and moon, as life in living creatures, as might in the mighty, as the wish for jivas to create bodies, meaning the life-force, as the humanhood in human beings, and as OM, the revealer of Self-Knowledge; even at the culmination of dissolution, it is That who exists as the Seed for the reemergence of the Cosmos. This cause of creation, preservation and dissolution - the sattva, raja and tamagunas - is also emanating from Kutasthachaitanya, but It is gracefully residing as Eternal and Immutable [8-12]. Ignorant human beings, being entranced by the Mayic three gunas, remain bound, with demonic nature, in the experience of ego-self-consciousness. Even though this three-guna-filled Maya is difficult to traverse, by the performance of Sadguru-initiated Kriya, it can be easily crossed [13-15]. The sick, those who crave material enjoyments, the seekers of Truth and the wise - these four types of human beings are of the highest; they take up the path of Consciousness. Among them, the wise ones are the highest of all; this type of birth is priceless in this world. After many lifetimes of accumulating good samskaras, by always remaining absorbed in Consciousness-Self with complete love and devotion, they easily attain the realization of Infinite Consciousness [16-19]. Being infatuated with each one’s own samskara-bound desires and in order to fulfill them, jivas accomplish the very temporal enjoyment of bodily pleasure ruled by some sense, or some other small part of Consciousness through reverence to ego-self-consciousness, and because of that, they experience the joy of that. In that, the inner power of the body becomes scattered and soon, one has to be immersed in the ocean of sorrow. But, upon the revelation of Atman-Consciousness, all enjoyment of the body, senses and all parts of Consciousness are fulfilled in their totality, and the Bliss of Knowledge manifests as Eternal and Endless [20-23]. Being with a body made by the Maya-united created-substances, human beings become stupefied by the favorable and unfavorable matters - like and dislike - concerning that body, and because of that, unable to experience that Immutable Infinite Consciousness upon which all elements of the present, past and future appear and disappear, they deem it to be unmanifested and manifested [24-27]. Those Kriyavan sadhakas whose Consciousness-covering veil has been torn off - they, in order to be liberated from the sufferings of samsara such as old age, death, etc., take refuge in Atman-Consciousness with one-pointed and fully engrossed mind, and going above the physical aspect, the subtle aspect, and yajna, they come to know that Brahman-Consciousness, all spiritual things, and all the workings of the Cosmos by meditating upon them, and thus they discard their bodies while being merged in the Eternal, Bliss of Knowledge [28-30]. Thus ends the seventh chapter of the yogashastra upanishad Srimad Bhagavad Gita with analysis via various scriptures of this country and the West, along with spiritual commentary.
