### Translation 
 --- 
Listening to Vedas for gain - like a poisonous vine In the end is of no good, for the moment satisfying Ignorant persons are captivated by those words Saying realization comes from studying that And they say that there is nothing else beside this Filled with desires, their craving minds Heaven, the land of gods, they deem as the highest And are reborn according to the karma they followed The karma that keeps them in greed and pleasures of senses The teachings for the attainment of such, they call the best - 42 and 43- Those whose minds are on karmakanda [rituals] and words of the Vedas Only addicted to pleasure, always, they are The Face of the Lord is All They certainly do not realize that by this - 44-

### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The ignorant persons who cannot even conceive of  the existence of higher work other than the acquisition of pleasure - as taught by flowery words, through which they aim to fulfill all kinds of desires and wish to acquire heavenly enjoyments as mentioned in the Vedas; those who have succumbed to desire and perceive as the highest thing the attainment of heaven through the good karmas of birth and work, as well as perform all kinds of actions in order to get many kinds of pleasures and wealth - the minds of those addicted to enjoyments and riches are always pulled by such things; because of which, their minds cannott become resolutely steady in the absorption of Soul-Consciousness, and they are not able to attain samadhi. - 42, 43 and 44-
