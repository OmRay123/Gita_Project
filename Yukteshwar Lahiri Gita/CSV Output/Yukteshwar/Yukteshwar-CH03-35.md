### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Therefore, although the Consciousness-revealing Atman-Kriya is formless, it is supreme, as opposed to all work that has beautiful form and desired results.  Because action with desire is a tremendous horror; it is by this that the jiva remains bound to this mundane world and experiences this immense suffering. - 35-
