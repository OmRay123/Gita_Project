### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Divinity, creative energy, glory, beauty, knowledge and non-attachment - together these six are called “bhaga.”  As in – aishvarya samagrasya viryasya yashasah shriyah jnanavairagyayoshchaiva yannam bhaga ity smritam From the Divine Kutasthachaitanya endowed with these six qualities, this type of experience happens:  that being a wise and discriminating person, it is not proper to grieve over unworthy things, because scientifically knowledgeable beings are not remorseful over the presence or absence of anything in this ever-changing world. -11-
