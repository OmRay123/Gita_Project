### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Just as the embodied souls naturally and gradually change physical states of childhood, youth, old age etc. yet the consciousness remains the same, in the same way, also naturally, one body is discarded after death and another body is taken.  The Soul is not destroyed by that.  The wise ones are not deluded in any way by all of these changes. - 13-
