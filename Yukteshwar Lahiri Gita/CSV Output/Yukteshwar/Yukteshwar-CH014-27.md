### Commentary

Commentary: Being completely established in Brahman, knowing the Eternal, Nectarous Knowledge, devoted to Brahman-Dharma, one becomes Brahman by such absorbed single-mindedness. - 27- Thus ends Gunatraya Vijnana Yoga* - the fourteenth chapter.** *[Translator’s note: In the statement of conclusion to this Chapter 14, the author has used a variation of the title of the Chapter. The title of Chapter 14 at the beginning is “Gunatrayavibhagayoga” which means: “the yoga of distinguishing the distinction between the three gunas.” The concluding statement uses the title “Gunatraya Vijnana Yoga,” which means: “the yoga of the science of the three gunas.”] **[Translator’s note: The author has used a different format for the concluding statement of Chapter 14 than the one followed from Chapter 10 through 13.]
