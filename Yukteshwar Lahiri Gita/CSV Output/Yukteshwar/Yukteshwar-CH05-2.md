Commentary: When the mind is fixed in the Kutasthachaitanya, an experience occurs that eradicating karma equally, and the performance of karma [action] in order to stop the fluctuations of consciousness are both great and will bestow liberation. In that, the consciousness-fluctuation-stopping performance of karma [action] in the form of Kriya yoga is the greatest. - 2-
