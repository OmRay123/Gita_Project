### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Kriyavan sadhakas perform Kriya desirelessly, and by the erosion of prarabdha they are purified in consciousness and thus they attain Tranquility. Those who are unconnected - “ayukta” - meaning those without Kriya - see themselves as the doers of all the work done by mind, intellect, body and senses. Being bound to the dream and desire of acquiring their fruits, they again take birth in this worldly life. - 12-
