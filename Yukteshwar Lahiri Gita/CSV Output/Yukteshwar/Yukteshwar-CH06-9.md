### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The good-hearted [suhrida], meaning naturally well-wishing, the boon companion [mitra], meaning well-wishing because of affection, “ari”, meaning enemy, the non-caring [udasina], meaning one who is not either in good or non-good, the centrist [madhyastha], meaning one who is in the middle of both good and bad, the hateful [dveshya], meaning one who is habitually wishes malefaction, the friend [bandhu], meaning one who wishes beneficence through relationship, the sage [sadhu], meaning one who is a virtuous Kriyavan of scriptural edicts, and the sinner [papi], meaning one who indulges in depravity - the one to whom all of the many such types of human beings are known as the same, meaning the one in whom not even the slightest affinity or repulsion arises in regards to all these - he is the supremely great master yogi. The matter written about in the aforementioned three slokas are expressed by Vaishnavas as “the net of illusory magic [kuhakjal],”  and they say that the beings of Self-knowledge whose minds are profoundly deep and steadfast, whose selves are immersed in the Self and who are wandering about in the Unfathomable Infinite Consciousness cannot even be touched by this kuhakjal.  But the human beings of limited understanding who are under the power of like- and dislike-joined greed, and who are immersed in the ocean of desire-fulfillment become caught in the hooks and webbings of this net of Maya and have to partake in the endless suffering of samsara.  To show how the Vaishnavas of the Baul sect express this, part of a song of theirs is presented below. “In the waters of the world, so terrifying is the kuhakjal O brother, the big fish with teeth Not for it is it so In the waters of the world, so terrifying is the kuhakjal O brother, the fish that moves in the unfathomable waters Does it die by this? Once it finds small fish, Maya’s hooks Immediately bind it In the waters of the world, so terrifying is the kuhakjal O brother, the bait of greed in the ocean of bhoga The one who lusts for it He is pierced by the fish-hook, caught in the webbings Strung up in humiliation In the waters of the world, so terrifying is the kuhakjal” -9-
