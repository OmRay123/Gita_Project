### Translation 
 --- 
If one is the worst of all sinners By the boat of Knowledge he can cross to the other shore - 36- The way blazing fire burns wood to ashes The fire of Knowledge burns away the body of sin in the same way - 37-

### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Even the worst sinners can be easily liberated from imprisonment of earthly existence by establishing prajna through the Guru-instructed yogakriya. Just as the blaze of fire burns all wood to ashes, in the same way, by the revelation of Knowledge, through which one experiences the world-Brahmanda in oneself and all creation of Brahman as if in the palm of one’s hand, and because of the tranquility of consciousness and the state of desirelessness attained by that, like burned seeds, all karmas become devoid of all germinating power. Thus, because no fruits are born from those karmas to be fulfilled in the future, the jiva is no longer bound to take birth again and again in samsara. - 36 and 37-
