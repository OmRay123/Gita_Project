### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The one who after death, meaning that the one who is as a dead body even before death, meaning that the one who resides separately from the mind-, intellect- and sense-connected body and who is not perturbed by the lust- and anger-force-connected pleasures or sorrows of any type - he is said to be the one who is united with the Self, and he is the one who attains that indestructible-Peace-filled, Suprreme Happiness-filled Kaivalyapada. Maharshi Vashishthadeva has also expounded upon this. As in - prane gate yatha dehah sukha duhkham na bindati tatha chet prahayuktehpi sa kaivalyashrame baset As a dead body while alive, the ones who are unmoved by any pleasure or sorrow of the mind, intellect, body and the senses, are the ones who are said to be residing in the house of Kaivalya. - 23-
