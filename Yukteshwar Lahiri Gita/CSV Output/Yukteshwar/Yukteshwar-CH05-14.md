Commentary: Atman-Consciousness, the Lord of this miniature world of the body, as the Self does not perform any work. Also, It does not cause the body, mind, intellect and the senses etc. to be engaged in any work, nor does It desire to enjoy the fruits of any karma. All work is done by nature in ignorance. - 14-
