Commentary: The one whose mind and spirit are disciplined and desireless and, by which, has renounced all cravings, doing only the necessary karma for the maintenance of the body, there is no possibility of harm coming to him, because by non-doing, there is no relationship to the future fruits of those actions, and thus he is not bound to the fulfillment of results. - 21-
