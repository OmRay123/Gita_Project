### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: In the day of the elemental aggregates - meaning when the union is broken - there is action with external subjects; and when night arrives - meaning that when there is union - again everything dissolves into Prakriti. In this way, becoming active again and again, [manifestation] is never completely withdrawn. - 19-
