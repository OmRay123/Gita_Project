### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Upon trusting Kutasthachaitanya, this type of experience happens:  those who for their own beneficence, meaning for the revelation of Atman Consciousness, have become immersed in the Sadguru-given yogakriya and have been able to experience even a little experience of Consciousness - there is never condemnation for them.  That Consciousness-experience of theirs cannot - not in this body, nor after the body, nor by anything - be destroyed. - 40-
