### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Jnanayoga is the highest of all yogas of kriya [using technique], higher than yogas of kriya based on material things. It is so because all kinds of yogas of kriya are only necessary so that one may realize Knowledge. And when Knowledge is revealed in Its Highest Form, meaning when prajna [aggregate of faculties of inner wisdom] becomes still, no type of yogas of kriya are necessary. All kriyas [techniques/processes] end in that prajna and one attains the immortally nectarous Tranquility. - 33-
