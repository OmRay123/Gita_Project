### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Those who have stilled their minds in the aforementioned way, and who, by experiencing Consciousness as the same and immutable in all things in the Universe, have attained the Brahman-condition - they are liberated from the many types of delusionary kleshas such as affinity, hatred, etc. These types of jivanmukta saddhakas are not elated at gaining any pleasurable things, nor are they despondent over getting something that is unwanted. - 20-
