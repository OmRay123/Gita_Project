Worshipping gods, one goes to the realm of the gods Worshipping the ancestral realm, one goes to the realm of the ancestors Worshipping ghosts, one goes to the realm of ghosts Doing upasana on Me, one gets Me - 25- Commentary: Those who are devoted to ancestral rituals attain the subtle ancestral realm from which this elemental world of ancestors has emerged. Those who are attached to rituals of gods, attain the overlords of this Universe. But those who do upasana of Atman-Consciousness, become filled with Spirit, merge into that Infinite Consciousness and thereby attain Brahman. - 25-
