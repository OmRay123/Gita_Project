Commentary: One should do reverent service to those wise ones who are Self-realized and Brahman-realized, and humbly ask them questions in regards to Atman, meaning questions such as - “What is Atman? To what are we bound? And how can we be free of this imprisonment?” and other inquiries such as these; and they will teach the way of liberation in the form of all these yogas of kriya. - 34-
