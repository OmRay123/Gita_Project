### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: In this way, sensing the positions of the mental faculties, by the power of the fire element at the two-petaled lotus in the middle of the eyebrows which reveals the bow/lingam of Mahadeva, transcending the spinal column (gandiva - ganda iva - like a knot) by Kriya, this type of desire occurs - that “let me once see with full consciousness the evil-minded side of ego/vanity (otherwise, the need for Kriya is not there for the Eternally Awakened Jiva).”  Who have come here against the five elements, during the practice of his [the sadhaka’s] beloved work? - 20, 21, 22 and 23-
