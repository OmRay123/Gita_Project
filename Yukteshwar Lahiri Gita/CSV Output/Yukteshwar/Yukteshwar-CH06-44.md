Commentary: Having taken birth in these types of situations, fixing the mind to Consciousness because of yogic habits from the previous body, they again take care to ascend in the yoga of Consciousness; and some, without effort and by themselves, go beyond all Vedic rituals, and enquiring into the techniques of yoga in order to become united with the Eternal, Bliss of Knowledge-filled Brahman-Consciousness, become engaged in the performance of yogakriya as was practiced in the previous body. - 43 and 44-
