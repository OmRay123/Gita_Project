### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The ignorant, indiscriminating, evil-doing, sin-enmeshed and base human beings, having been stupefied by the sattva-, raja- and tamoguna-filled, supernatural-power-endowed Maya, acquire many types of demonic qualities such as egotism etc. and are thus bound by ego-self-consciousness. Although this three-guna-filled, supernatural-power-endowed Maya is extremely difficult to traverse, those who have taken up the path of Consciousness and who are performing the Sadguru-given Kriya are able to easily cross beyond this Maya and experience that Eternal, Bliss-of-Knowledge Form of Atman-Consciousness. - 14 and 15-
