### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: All things and even all aspects of those things - internal and external - of the aforementioned enormous Brahmanda-Cosmos and its miniscule part, the microcosmic form of the body, are existing as manifested because of the all-revealing Kutasthachaitanya. This Kutasthachaitanya is present as the all-pervading, Self-Knowledge-revealing Pranava [OM], as Life in all creatures including human beings, and as the Radiance of the lords and gods of the subtle world - sun, moon etc. In physical creation, this Kutasthachaitanya is present as the sound which is manifesting the very subtle (rarified) all-pervading space, as the energy/heat-essence which is manifesting the fire-like substances, and the pure fragrance which is the essence of the hard (solid) Earth. This Kutasthachaitanya is present as the life-force in all living creatures, as austerity in the ascetic with the capacity to withstand cold, heat, conflict etc., as wisdom in the intelligent, as brilliance in the brilliant ones, and even as the Cause of the reemergence of this Cosmos after its dissolution - even in that, It Is. - 8, 9 and 10-
