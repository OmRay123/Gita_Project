### Commentary

**[Translator’s note: In certain versions of the Gita, this sloka (13:1) is omitted; in certain other versions, this sloka is presented but left unnumbered, and the numbering begins with the next sloka. Thus, because of either the omission of the first sloka or not numbering it, some versions of the Chapter 13 in different Gitas have only 34 slokas (actual or numbered) instead of 35.] Commentary: Arjuna said, “O Keshava! What is the ‘field’ [kshetra]? Who is the knower of [or knowledgeable about] the ‘field’ [kshetrajna]? And what are ‘Prakriti,’ ‘Purusha,’ ‘Knowledge’ [jnana] and that which is to be ‘Known’ [jneya]? Tell me all of this. I will listen.” - 1-
