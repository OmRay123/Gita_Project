### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Trying to renounce all karma equally and thus trying to reside in non-attached tranquility without purifying consciousness by the consciousness-fluctuation-stopping Kriya only causes sorrow. But purifying consciousness by yogakriya and thereby achieving steadiness of mind, one can easily eradicate all karmic restlessness, and by experiencing Full Consciousness in oneself, one can attain Kaivalyapada. - 6-
