### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: It is written in the Patanjal philosophical treatise that when stillness manifests out of the openness of sadhakas, the Soul-Consciousness Itself becomes satisfied.  As in - nirvicharavaisharadyehadhyatmaprasadah -   Samadhipada - no. 4 When Soul-Consciousness becomes thus contented, then imaginary falsehoods disappear and the Truth, unmanufactured by imagination, is revealed to the faculty of inner sight.  As in - ritambhara tatra prajna -   Samadhipada - no. 48 By this, it can be known that when the fire element in the midst of the families of pravritti and nivritti becomes sullen, meaning when the rajoguna becomes low and is incapable of doing what needs to be done, then the sadhakas, having arrived at the navel-lotus, awaken the Kundalini Shakti by the Guru-instructed Kriya and become still and open.  In that, Kutasthachaitanya (Sri Krishna) becomes pleased and through the inner wisdom-sight, Truth, unmanufactured by imagination, is experienced in these ways. - 10-
