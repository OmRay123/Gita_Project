### Translation 
 --- 
Without karma [action] people cannot have knowledge Without knowledge one cannot attain liberation in sannyas - 4- Without action the jnani or the ignorant Cannot remain even for a moment, not even the wise Because of the natural impulse of affection and hatred Powerlessly are they doing karma - 5-

### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Without attaining Knowledge through the performance of Kriya yoga, just abandoning all types of karma [actions] and taking up sannyas will not bring that [Knowledge] without work, because the knowledgeable and ignorant alike cannot exist even for a moment without karma.  Thus, if one does not do the karma of the Purusha-guna that reveals Consciousness, one falls under the stupor of the Prakriti-qualities of sattva, raja and tamoguna, and being enslaved by affection, hatred, wants etc., one becomes involved in an unaware state with the workings of worldly life. - 4 and 5-
