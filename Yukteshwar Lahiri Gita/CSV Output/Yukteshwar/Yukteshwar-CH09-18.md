### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: That Infinite Consciousness is Itself the savior, supporter and Lord of goodness of all jivas up to the ultimate; It is He Who is the Witness of all fruits of good and bad karma and their fulfillment; it is He Who is the Cause of this Cosmos’ and samsara’s creation, preservation and destruction. More than that, it is He who is the profound Cause of this Cosmos’ appearance and its dissolution. - 18-
