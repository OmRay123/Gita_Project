### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The one who, upon experiencing himself as separate from the quintelemental body and seeing that he is uninvolved in the work being done by the body and the senses, observes himself to be a non-doer who is satisfied and detached to the action performed by the body and the senses, and who understands this non-doing and satisfied detachment as one’s true state of work in which he performs Kriya, he is the highest among human beings who truly understands the workings of things. He can live always united with Consciousness - meaning being in samadhi while awake - while performing all action and remaining uninvolved from all karma. - 18-
