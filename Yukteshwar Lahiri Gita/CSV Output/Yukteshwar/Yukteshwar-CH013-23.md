### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Witness,* patron, lord, enjoyer - all of these are Brahman. He is the One Who is called Paramatman, meaning [the One Who is] called Kutastha. In this body is Kutastha - Purusha is there after that. - 23- *[Translator’s note: The word “witness” is the translation of the word “upadrashta,” which is the first word of sloka 13:23. In the published Bengali print, there seems to have been a printing error and the word “upadeshta” is written in the commentary part, even though that is not the word in the sloka. If “upadeshta” were to be the word in the commentary section, it would be defined as “preceptor” instead of “witness.” Both definitions are thus given here for the sake of the reader.]
