### Translation 
 --- 
Killing kin will bring the death of all virtue Killing virtue leads all lineages to immoral ways - 39- The sin of family will corrupt the women of the line When the women are evil then half-breeds will be born, O Lord - 40- The family and those who slay kin For this, all, with their half-breeds, go to hell No more the offerings of food to them Their forefathers fall from grace - 41-

### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The slaying of kin brings about the destruction of the forever practiced universal codes of familial behavior, meaning the end of the enjoyment of physical things experienced by sight, touch, etc.  The presiding family will be overcome with that which is outside the codes and the physical experience will be nothing.  When the physical experience becomes nothing, those powers of sight and touch will become corrupt and many kinds of delusionary experiences will arise.  Because of these delusionary occurrences, the five elements who are responsible for the destruction of sensory experience face grave danger from mind, intellect, karma etc. having lost the things that kept them alive. - 39, 40 and 41-
