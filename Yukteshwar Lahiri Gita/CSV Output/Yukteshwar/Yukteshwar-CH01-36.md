### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Those who burn homes, poison people, take up weapons to kill, plunder and steal wealth, land or wives - they are called “atatayi.”  There is no justification needed to kill these types of people, because there is no wrong in kiilling atatayis.  As in - agnido garadashchaiva shastrapani dhanapahah kshetradarapahari cha shadete atatayinah atatayinamayantam hanyadeva vicharayan natatayi badhe dosho hanturbhavati kashchan It is true that scholars of the shastras have said this type of thing, but still, if we destroy the clans of mind and ego and the faculties who are their comrades, it will actually destroy us.   Because - in what way can we have the enjoyment of happiness if we eradicate these eternally revered faculties of mind?  Therefore, ddestroying these mental constructs cannot by justified as a good thing. - 36-
