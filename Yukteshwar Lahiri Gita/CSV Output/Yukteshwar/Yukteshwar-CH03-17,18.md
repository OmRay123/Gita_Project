The one whose pleasure is only in Atman In the experience of Atman whose heart is in bliss To the one in whose mind enjoyment of cravings never occurs Over that one karma has no right - 17- He is not sanctified by doing holy work If he does not work, no sin he incurs In the three worlds there is not for that Atman-residing one Any dependence on anything - 18-

### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Those who have renounced the thirst for all things and upon attaining the Bliss of Atman-experience have become satisfied; those whose passion and pleasure is in Atman alone, and who are content in Atman Itself - they do not need to perform any action.  Because what can these Atman-realized beings who have the Bliss of Brahman gain byy performing any karma [action]?  It means that there is nothing to gain.  And it is written in the Patanjal philosophical treatises that “vyadhi,” meaning physical incapability, “styan,” meaning mental incapability, “pramad,” meaning intoxication, “alasya,” meaning laziness, “avirati,” meaning lust, “bhrantidarshan,” meaning delusionary knowledge, “alabdhabhumikatva,” meaning incapability of getting results, and “anavasthitachittatva,” meaning restlessness - the Bliss of Brahman is prevented by these scattering the mind.  But the revelation of the Knowledge of Atman annihilates all of these things mentioned above.  As in - tatah pratyakchetanadhigamohapantarayabhavashcha -   no. 29 vyadhistyanasamshayapramadalasyaviratibhrantidarshanalabdha bhumikatvanavasthitatvani chittavikshepastehantarayam - -  no. 30 - Samadhipada Therefore, if the Atman-realized beings, because they always remain in Atman-Consciousness, do not perform the all-obstacle-free Kriya, there is no wrong.  And because they always reside in the Bliss of Brahman, they do not have to even think about taking the slightest refuge in Brahman in order to be protected from the enslaving desires of the sattva, raja and tamogunas of Prakriti. - 17 and 18-
