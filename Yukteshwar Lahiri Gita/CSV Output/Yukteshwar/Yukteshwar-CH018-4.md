### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The “tyagi” person is powerful like a tiger. Just as a tiger devours an animal when it gets near him, in the same way [the tyagi] destroys all unworthy desires. As [the tyagi] continues to destroy [desires] in this way, no desires come within his proximity in the future. That is of three types. - 4-
