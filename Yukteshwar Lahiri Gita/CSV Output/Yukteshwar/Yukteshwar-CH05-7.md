### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Those who by yogakriya become self-purified and bring the body and senses, etc. under complete control and reside separately from them as the Self, and those who realize the Consciousness pervading the Universe into Brahman Itself to be undifferentiated from the Atman-Consciousness in oneself - they, even though they perform all kinds of karma for the maintenance of physical life, are unattached to any of their resuults; they are not enmeshed in them. - 7-
