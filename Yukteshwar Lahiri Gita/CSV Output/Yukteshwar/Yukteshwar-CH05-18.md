Commentary: Although a cow, an elephant, a dog and such classes of nature, the highest brahmin of yogakriya with supreme knowledge, the humble and the wealthy, and low beings of inferior activities, have tremendous differences even in one race or class because of diverse tendencies, the wise understand that all these are only variants of Prakriti, and, experiencing that all-pervading Consciousness as the Soul-Self equally in all perceptible things, they consider all of them to be the same. - 18-
