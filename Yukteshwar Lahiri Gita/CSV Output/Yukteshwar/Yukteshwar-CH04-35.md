### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: When prajna is established by this yogakriya, one is never again under the stupor of ignorance. After understanding the nature of all things of creation, through this prajna, as being in the Self, the jiva realizes that the Self is the Infinite Consciousness, and the Creator and Sustainer of the Universe, and thus it attains liberation from being bound to earthly existence. - 35-
