### Translation 
 --- 
Those who always think of sense objects Become addicted to those objects, O Pandava With that comes much obsession When indulgence ends anger arises - 62- In anger and frustration is delusion born, and delusion kills memory If memory goes, so does reason, when reason goes all is lost - 63-

### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Continuously thinking about things of sense perception, one becomes obsessed with that, and from that a craving, meaning excessive obsession, for those objects manifests.  When such enjoyment is disrupted, anger emerges.  Anger gives rise to delusion.  Delusion destroys reason, and destruction of reason causes total stupor in ignorance and one becomes as if dead. - 62 and -63-
