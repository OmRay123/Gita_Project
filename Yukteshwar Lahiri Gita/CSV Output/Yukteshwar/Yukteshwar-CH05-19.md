### Commentary

Commentary: If Prakritic distortions do not arise in the mind, meaning that if jivas do not become corrupted by uniting with Prakriti-Shakti, then jivas experience all things in the Universe as equal, and attaining that unalloyed, equanimous, supreme condition of Brahman, they gain victory over birth and death even while in the body, meaning that birth and death come under their power and become slaves to their whim. This is called “jivanmuktavastha.” - 19-
