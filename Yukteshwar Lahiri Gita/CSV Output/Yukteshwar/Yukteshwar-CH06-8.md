### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Knowledge, meaning knowing about things in treatises by the proofs realized by others, and Science, meaning experiencing by oneself beyond all those attained proofs and knowing by oneself -   the one who has satisfied oneself by such, the one who has brought the five organs of perception, the five organs of actioon, mind and all of these senses under one’s own power, and the one to whose mind gold, a clod of earth, a stone etc. - all things to whom are the same - meaning discerning them as only permutations of manifesting Consciousness, and therefore, the one whose consciousness is not the slightest bit perturbed by all kinds of things happening in the present -   it is that sadhaka whose fluctuations of consciousness have ceased. - 8-
