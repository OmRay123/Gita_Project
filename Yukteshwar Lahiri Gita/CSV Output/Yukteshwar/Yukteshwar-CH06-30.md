### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Those who in this way experience the existence of all created things of the world as Atman-Consciousness’s and in Atman-Consciousness, those eternally merged sadhakas’ consciousnesses are always in an awakened state. They are never outside of Consciousness, meaning they are never “un-”conscious. They live ever-awakened. - 30-
