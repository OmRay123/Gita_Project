Commentary: When the mind by its nature is influenced by the restless aspect of rajoguna and is thereby unsettled, with wherever things it faces and becomes distracted, one should, by the Sadguru-instructed Kriya, withdraw the mind from those things and bring it under the control of the Self. - 26-
