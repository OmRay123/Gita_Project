### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Being a householder itself means that there will be great affinity towards sound, touch, form, taste, smell and such sense-oriented things, and because there is a lack of enjoyment of those things in the path of Knowledge, a great deal of anger towards that, and in order to be pacified, people of the world remain fearfully bound to the enjoyment of sense-objects. But sadhakas renounce the above-mentioned affinities, fear and anger, and remain one-pointedly in the Kutastha, discerning all these worldly enjoyments to be trivial; and by attaining Knowledge by the Consciousness-revealing Kriya, filled with Full-Consciousness, they are merged in Brahman-Consciousness. - 10-
