### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The one who, stills the mind from its movements by withdrawing the senses from their self-concerning things through the use of the Sadguru-bestowed yogic method, and who upon equalizing the prana-vayu between the eyebrows does tranquil japa of Omkar, and who thereby continuously meditating on the physical-subtle-causal-encompassing, all Cosmos-pervading Infinite Consciousness, leaves the body in this way - he attains that Supreme Nirvana. - 12 and 13-
