### Translation

Do not ever keep the mind in material things Half-closed eyes look at one point Prana and apana, above and below, the two are spread Bring them together in the middle of the nose - 27- Control yourself the senses, intellect and mind Renouncing the pleasure of heaven, leading to liberation The one who is ever without desire, fear, anger He is eternally free, know that he has attained - 28-

### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Those sadhakas, having taken up the path of liberation, who have renounced all sensory bhoga of sound, touch etc. and who by focusing on the connecting point of the eyebrows equalize prana and apana within the nose, who have immersed the senses, mind and intellect into the Atman, and who are devoid of all distortions of Consciousness, such as desire, fear and anger - they, at all times, attain liberation even in this alive state. Sadhakas call that type of state jivanmuktavastha. - 28-
