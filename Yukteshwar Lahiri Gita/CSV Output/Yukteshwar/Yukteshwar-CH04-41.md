### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Therefore, if the jiva can, by the Guru-instructed Knowledge of liberation as stated in the scriptures, tear up all doubt and, by the performance of yogakriya with certainty of mind, eliminate all karma - meaning all restlessness of the senses and pranic faculties - and reside contentedly in Atman-Consciousness, then the jiva is not bound to any type of karma of the body or of the senses. - 41-
