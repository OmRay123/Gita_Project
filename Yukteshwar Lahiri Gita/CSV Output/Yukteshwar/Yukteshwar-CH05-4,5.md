### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The sannyasyoga of the discipline of knowledgeable ones, meaning the yoga of non-doing, and the Kriya yoga of kriyavans - performing either one completely can lead to the attainment of Kaivalyapada and Tranquility. The knowledgeable ones ascerttain that both are the same. The childish and ignorant see them as different. By both - the performance of the consciousness-fluctuation-stopping Kriya yoga, or residing in the state of tranquil non-attachment from the renunciation of all karma - one can experience Full Consciousness and be liberated from enchainment of the world. Because they yield the same result, they are the same thing. The one who has understood this is a true jnani and judicious. - 4 and 5-
