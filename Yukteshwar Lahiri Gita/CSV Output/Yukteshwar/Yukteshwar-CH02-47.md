### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Everyone has the rightful authority to karma [action] only, but on the fruits of action no one has authority of control.  Therefore, it is inappropriate to be engaged in karma desiring its fruits, and should not abandon karma upon perceiving a delay in the manifestation of its fruits. - 47-
