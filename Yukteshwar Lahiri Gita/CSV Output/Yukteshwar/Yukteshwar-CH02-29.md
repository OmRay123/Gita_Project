Commentary: Some ( initiated by Sadguru) upon seeing this Eternal-Knowledge-Bliss Form become stupefied; some rapturously describe That; some listen in wonderment; and some, even after studying many types of shastras and receiving wisdom from sages and hearing about this Brahman-Consciousness again and again, still cannot understand the matter, being under the power of an opposing mind. - 29-
