### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: In this way, when the minds of jivas, to obtain the fruits of each one’s own desire, wish to manifest some senses-ruled bodily joy, or wish to manifest happiness through devotion to some part of Consciousness, meaning - when the mind’s sattvic condition (neutralized state) is transformed and becomes active (polarized) with a guna such as rajas, by Kutasthachaitanya, the proper reverence appears in jivas’ minds, and upon having the enjoyment of that miniscule part of Consciousness, jivas are bestowed capability. In this way, having obtained some capability from Kutasthachaitanya, the rich rewards that jivas receive from having executed such work are also for the purpose of satisfying jivas’ minds, meaning - for the purpose of establishing the mind again in its natural state, and such happens also by Kutasthachaitanya. The extensive description of this appears in the commentary to the 70th sloka of the second chapter of this book. - 21 and 22-
