### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: It has concluded in sloka no. 70 of the second chapter of this book that:  being bound to desire and in order to enjoy the fulfillment of the matters of desire, jivas take birth again and again; and in this chapter this type of essence has been expressed which says that when Atman-Consciousness is experienced by the reverent performance of Sadguru-instructed yogakriya, mind becomes filled with the Bliss of Self-Knowledge and wants to leave behind the pleasures connected with the enjoyment of external things.  Upon this, this type of doubt arises in the fire element that:  there are those who acquired the Bliss of Atman by the Sadguru-graced yogakriya, and by being enjoined in reverence of Atman-Consciousness, they wished to leave behind the paltry, momentary happiness connected with the enjoyment external things; but because of the state of vairagya in the mind becoming disrupted repeatedly, not being able to remain in Atman-Consciousness, they became faulty in their taking care, lackadaisical in their practice and never were they able to reside in the state of the Bliss-filled Eternal Knowledge.  O Kutasthachaitanya!  What will be the way for them?  Will these types of sadhakas who could not realize that Supreme Brahman-Substance and who, by having desisted sense-enjoyment, cannot take birth in the desire-oriented creation be eternally in a delusion-drenched state, like broken clouds floating in space until they are destroyed at the time of Final Dissolution? - 37 and 38-
