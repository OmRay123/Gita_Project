Commentary: For persons willing to fulfill desires, many kinds of rituals based on the three gunas - sattva, raja and tama - are described in the Vedas.  But one should go beyond these three gunas and endure pleasure, pain and conflicts, meaning - have profound patience, and renounce the desire to acquire what one does not have and the concern to protect what one does have, and be calm, meaning - be at peace. - 45-
