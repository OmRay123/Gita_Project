### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: It has been clearly explained in the commentary to the previous sloka that if one wants to control oneself, four states of being gradually arise in consciousness which are named, “yataman,” “vyatirek,” “ekindriya” and “vashikar.”  Among these states mentioned, Maharshi Patanjali has referred to the state named “vashikar” as being synonymous in meaning to “vairagya” [non-attachment].  Now, in this sloka, the matters on that which have been expressed as “vashyatma” or “samyatma” - which have been stated in regards to the sadhakas whose consciousnesses are absorbed the condition of “vashikaravastha” - are being explained below. In the state of the Self-revealed Consciousness, it can be known that those who are immersed in vairagya, meaning those whose consciousnesses have attained “vashikaravastha” -  by performing with great care the Sadguru-given way of yogakriya, they realize the Self-revealed Consciousness state and are able to live filled with the form of the Eternal Bliss of Knowledge.  But those who are not adjoined in vairagya, meaning those whose consciousnesses are inclined towards material things - for them the aforementioned state of being is ever unattainable. - 36-
