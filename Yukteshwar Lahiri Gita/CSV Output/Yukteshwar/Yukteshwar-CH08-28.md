Commentary: Whatever beneficence and joy can be obtained by studying all the Vedas, performing all types of yajnas, all types of austere penances, and all types of renunciation - the sadhakas established in Atman-Consciousness experience all that in the Supreme Atman-Bliss, which is beyond all those practices, and in the end, they even go beyond Prakriti and attain the Highest Nirvana and Brahman-ness. - 28- SUMMARIZED DESCRIPTION OF CHAPTER EIGHT After the previously-mentioned type of experience in Kutasthachaitanya, this type of question arises in the energy of the fire element: what are Brahman, adhyatma, adhidaiva, adhibhutkarma and adhiyajna? And in what way do they exist in this body? And how do sadhakas with absorbed minds, filled with the total realization of Brahman, leave their bodies? [1 - 2] Answering that, this type of experience happens in the Kutasthachaitanya of sadhakas: The Imperishable Infinite Consciousness which is beyond creation is what is known as Brahman; and within creation, His causal-body-based life-element without permutation is adhayatma; the ever-transforming form of this Cosmos is His physical essence adhibut; and His inner-residing, Lord of creation form as the subtle essence is called adhidaiva. The sum total of this phenomena, rising out of the Consciousness-Being - the Omkar Sound - is the only Self-Kriya; and the One, taking Whose recourse brings about the emergence of that Omkar Sound - that Kutasthachaitanya is the One Who is adhiyajna. He abides in this Cosmos as the Highest of All [3 - 4]. At the time oof leaving the body, the thoughts that become established in the mind of the jiva because of the united power of many types of samskaras - attached to and according to that conglomeration, the jiva takes birth in samsara. Therefore, if Brahman-realization is established at that time, then Brahman-ness is what is attained. There is absolutely no uncertainty about this. Therefore, one should always remain in Kriya with mind surrendered in Kutasthachaitanya [5 - 7]. The one who, by yogic practice, with devoted heart and by the Sadguru-bestowed method, holds prana between the eyebrows and abides in that Omniscient, Ruler of All, Lord of the Universe, beyond the buddhi and even the supremely subtle Prakriti, the Supreme, Beginningless, Perfect, Self-Revealed Infinite Consciousness, and leaves his body thus - he becomes Brahman [8 - 10]. The practitioners who are devoid of affinity etc., withdraw their senses, still the fluctuations of mind, merge prana into the Brahmarandhra with certain dharana methods, and by constantly meditating on the all-Cosmos-pervading, sum total of the physical, subtle, causal phenomena, the Ishwar-Consciousness Word of OM - they leave their bodies and attain that Abode of Kaivalya, the Immutable subject spoken of by the realized ones [11 - 13]. Even after attaining Brahmaloka, because of Supreme Contentment being still unsatisfied, such jivas again and again take birth in creation; but the sadhakas who with one-pointed mind remain engrossed in the meditation of Atman-Consciousness and thus attain that Beingness of Eternal Consciousness - they never again have to return to this samsara, the abode of sorrow [14 - 16]. The Cosmos manifests for millions of years in the day of Brahma and for millions of years it remains in a dissolved state in the Inexpressible Nature during the night of Brahma. The sadhakas who, having crossed over the Wheel of Maya through the sacrament of Sadguru and with one-pointed devotion, have experienced that All-pervading Supreme Substance of Atman Consciousness - the One Who is Immutable throughout the repeated creation and destruction of the phenomenal aggregate, and the Sustainer of the entire Cosmos - they never again have to become slaves to creation [17 - 22]. Because they are deluded with the fulfillment of desire, inferior jivas are unconscious, due to which they become attached to sense-objects and thereby have to come back to samsara; and elevated sadhakas, because they remain in the Fiery and Powerful, Radiantly Effulgent, Self-Revealed Atman Consciousness, they fully satisfy all sensory desire and having no need to come back to samsara, they abide in the Indestructible Peace. These two types of good and evil ways are always present in the world [23 - 26]. The little bit of joy that is obtained through the study of the Vedas, yajna, austere penance, charity etc. - because sadhakas by the Sadguru-graced method reside in that Atman Consciousness - the abode of the totality of all those joys, nothing is able to delude them [27 - 28]. Thus ends the eighth chapter of the yogashastra upanishad Srimad Bhagavad Gita with analysis via various scriptures of this country and the West, along with spiritual commentary.
