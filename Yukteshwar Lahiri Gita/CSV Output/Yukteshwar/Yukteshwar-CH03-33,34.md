### Translation 
 --- 
The samskara that is born of ancient karma According to nature it is say the shastras Following one’s nature as it is Helplessly even the wise do karma In meaningless karma all jiva’s are bound by their nature So what will you do by restraining the senses - 33- Getting that which the senses favor As satisfaction is born, turn away from it then In the same way, when unfavorable things one gets Turn away from the hatred arising because of them Do not be enslaved by like and dislike, Dhananjaya Cultivating these cause vices to rise - 34-

### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Not to even mention ordinary people, even knowledgeable persons habitually engage themselves in sense-oriented karma according to their personal nature, which is the result of previously created samskara from past actions.  Thus, it is in the nature of the senses to have affection for favorable things and repulsion for unfavorable things, which are both from previous samskara.  This like and dislike are the obstacles to liberation.  One should not be subjugated by them.  There is no need to restrain the senses; that is unnatural; because this entire world and Brahmanda is under the rule of samskaras; no one is beyond it. - 34-
