### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Those human beings who have become stupefied by the want of enjoyment because of their nature being permeated with affinity and repulsion etc., who are engrossed in the activities that bring about the useless hopes of happiness and useless partaking in samsara, and who have become unconscious by the useless arguments of scriptural knowledge - those unwise ones, not being able to experience the Supremeness of Atman-Consciousness - meaning that only Consciousness exists indivisibly as this entire Cosmos and the world-Brahmanda up to the ultimate, think that the abidance of Infinite Consciousness in the human body is insignificant and do not give that any attention. - 11 and 12-
