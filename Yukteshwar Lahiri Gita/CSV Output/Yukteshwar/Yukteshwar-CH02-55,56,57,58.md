The Lord to Arjuna said When in the Bliss of Atman one is absorbed All desires of mind will be discarded by him Then he will be called “sthitaprajna” - 55- The ones without anxiety and sorrow in mind Being in this bliss do not care about such In whose consciousness there is no infatuation, anger or fear All scriptures call that sage “sthitaprajna” - 56- He who has affection to nothing Does not coddle himself in excessive pleasure Receiving great suffering does not hate His mind is established [in Brahman] the scriptures say - 57- The way a tortoise with all its limbs The same way the senses from its objects Those who effortlessly draw them within Know that his mind is established [in Brahman] - 58-

### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: When the mind becomes concentrated in the Kutasthachaitanya, the experience happens that those who renounce all mental cravings and remain content in themselves; those who are devoid of enmity in suffering, devoid of envy in pleasure and free from all obsession, fear and anger; those who do not have particular affection for anything; those who do not experience satisfaction from propitious matters, and do not experience dissatisfaction from unpleasant matters; and those who, like the tortoise that withdraws its limbs, effortlessly withdraw their senses from their objects of sight, sound, touch etc. and reside in Atman - their prajna is established and they are called sthitaprajna. - 55, 56, 57 and 58-
