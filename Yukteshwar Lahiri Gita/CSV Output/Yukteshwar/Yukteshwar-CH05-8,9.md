### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Seeing, hearing, touching, smelling and tasting comprise the functions of the five organs of perception. Speaking, holding, moving, urinating and excreting comprise the functions of the five organs of action. Pranic work such as inspiration, expiration etc. comprise the functions of the five airs. Steadfastness, unfolding etc. are the functions of the inner senses of mind, and dreaming etc. are of the intellect. Because kriyavan sadhakas reside separately from the body and senses, they experience that the ten sense-organs of the body, the five pranas, mind and intellect are carrying out all the work mentioned above via the seventeen forms in the subtle body; the Self is not involved in any of this. - 8 and 9-
