### Translation 
 --- 
The organs of action, the organs of perception - that are in the body All of the numerous types of work are done by them One whose wisdom is tattered by ego In vanity, thinks of himself as the lord and doer - 27-

### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The material jiva is inert.  All work is executed by Prakriti’s sattva-, raja-, and tamoguna-based senses.  Entangled in ignorance, the jiva discerns the sense oriented ego-substance to be the Atman and being captivated by that, ascertains “I am the one who is doing.” - 27-
