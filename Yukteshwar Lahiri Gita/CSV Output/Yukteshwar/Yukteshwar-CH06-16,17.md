### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Those who either eat too much or constantly fast, as well as those who sleep excessively or generally remain without much sleep are not able to have the revelation of Consciousness.  Therefore, to unite with Consciousness, things such as eating, recreation, sleep, being awake, and all present work to be done, should be carried out in an orderly, moderate and balanced manner.  If one is in Self-Kriya being able live in this moderate and balanced way, then all suffering is destroyed and consciousness becomes one with Atman-Consciousness. - 16 and 17-
