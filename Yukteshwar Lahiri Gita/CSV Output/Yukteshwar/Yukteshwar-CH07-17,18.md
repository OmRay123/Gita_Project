### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Because they take up the path of Consciousness - the most excellent thing of life - these four types of sadhakas are the highest. But among them, the one who, upon having listened to, thought about, and intensely meditated upon the matters of Atman from the scriptures and the words of Sadguru, acquires non-experiential knowledge of the Self from others and thus takes up the path of Consciousness - he, knowing Atman-Consciousness as the only substance of devotion and the Supreme Way, offers all his affection to It with great love, and always taking refuge in It, residing with mind merged in It, attains the realization of that Infinite Consciousness. - 17 and 18-
