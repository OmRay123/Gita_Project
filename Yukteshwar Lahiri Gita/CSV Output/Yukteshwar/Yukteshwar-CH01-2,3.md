### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The events surrounding Dhrishtadyumna’s birth in the Mahabharata is written in this way:  Because of Drona humiliating the king Drupada through Drona’s disciples, the king Drupada invited several sages and performed a fire ritual to kill Drona.  From that, one son and one daughter came about.  The daughter’s name was Draupadi, and the son’s name was Dhrishtadyumna.  The spiritual significance of this is (krip’s sister’s husband is Drona; the substance of krip is imagination; with kin shakti the result is fire) that when one is enslaved by samskaras, and by the quickening force of the Consciousness-revealing Kriya (drupada) disrespect to the king is born in the jiva, then it is necessary to take the company of saints; because, by that, the speedy force again takes place and establishes Kriya in order to destroy samskaras.  By that, restlessness is subdued and a Consciousness-Light is revealed, and right alongside that the kundalini shakti is experienced.  This kundalini shakti is Draupadi and this Consciousness-Light is Dhrishtadyumna (dharshanena dyuh jyotih vidyate yasya).  Now, the meaning of the sloka is like this, as in: In this way, through divine sight, mind observes that:  the primary element of the pravritti side, vanity/egoism, upon seeing the happenings on the back part of the body, meaning, the happenings on the nivritti side by the power of Kriya with the six chakras, five elements and the rest of the company of nivritti, feels that without samskaras no one can ever do any work.  Methods or techniques are all learned via the particulars of living in the world.  This world-guru is samskara-educated (disciple of Drona).  After the subjugation of restlessness via the fast, quickening force of the Consciousness-revealing Kriya, by the Tranquil Light (the son of Drupada, Dhrishtadyumna) the six chakras are revealed, and the five elements with their company are in their places. - 2 and 3 -
