Commentary: When raja and tama gunas are absent, sattva guna is illuminated - sattva after raja, tama after sattva, sattva after tama - raja after sattva - that form - ida, sushumna, pingala before - ida again after sushumna - meaning after scuffling and fighting - after mercy and forgiveness - tama - meaning after the noisy aggressiveness - peacefulness - after peacefulness, again fighting. - 10-
