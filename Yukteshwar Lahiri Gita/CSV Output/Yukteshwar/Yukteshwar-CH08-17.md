### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: After one goes beyond the Wheel of Maya upon having taken up the Sadguru-bestowed Kriya, the way that the evolution of twelve thousand earth years - meaning one Daiva Yuga - can be completed in this elemental body, and the way that one day’s work - meaning the dissolution of mind, intellect and even ego has been clearly explained in the eighth sloka of the fourth chapter. Now, the significance of this sloka is this: those who, in the above-mentioned way by the Grace of Sadguru, have gone beyond the Wheel of Maya and completed one kalpa - meaning the Kriya of one day of Brahma - in their own elemental bodies, and thereby experienced the dissolution of each one’s mana, buddhi, chitta and ahamkar, and then inverting it, have been able to be again present in a body-form - they are the ones that the saintly scriptural scholars call “ahoratrajna” [knower of “aho ratri”]. - 17-
