### Commentary

[*Important note:  The numbering of the slokas in this chapter from this point on can differ in various renditions of the Gita.  In some popular versions, the asterisked point marks the completion of the 26th sloka.  In this version of the Gita, the sloka is not completed until the next line.  Therefore, in some Gitas, the total number of slokas in the first chapter is 47, whereas in this version of the Gita, the total number of slokas is 46.  However, the total text in either type of the Gita is the same.  There are no omissions.  The apparent unevenness of this sloka 26 is balanced out in sloka number 36, being another three-line sloka.  It is necessary to point this out since readers might be following this translation with either the Sanskrit or transliterations of other versions of the scripture and the numbers may not coincide. **In some Gitas, this line is the first line of sloka 27, as previously mentioned.] Poetically: Among those soldiers were many of the paternal side Grandfathers, teachers and maternal uncles Nephews, grandsons, companions, in-laws and others of one’s own In that place did Arjuna see - 26- Arjuna, observing his friends present there Said with much compassion and pathos - 27- I see all have come desiring war Paralyzed is my body and dry is my mouth - 28 My body trembles with hair standing on end The bow slips from my hand and my skin is burning - 29- I am unsteady, my mind feels this is a mistake Krishna, the reason for this I see as gravely contradictory - 30- Commentary: The cause of the endless appearances of births is represented by the father figure Bhurishrava/karma, along with the Abhaschaitanya as the grandfather, samskaras as guru, the maternal uncles being the faculties of attachment and obsession from Madraraj, vanity/ego being like brothers, race/class-consciousness as sons, grandsons being offsprings of that race/class-consciousness, the elders/Ashvatthama representing desires, Drupada, the father of the Kundalini Shakti Draupadi, as the father-in-law, meaning the speedy force, and many other benevolent faculties are present among this opposing side.  When this is experienced in the energy of the fire element, one succumbs to maya, becomes depressed and dry-mouthed while the body is rendered not wanting to do anything.  The body shakes and chills run through it leading to the feeling that the body is on fire.  The spinal column is not accessible.  Even the patience to sit still is shattered and the stability of mind is ruined.  These types of troublesome signs point to a lower state of being. - 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30-
