### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: When all this is experienced in Kutasthachaitanya, an experience happens in the energy of the fire element that: although it is true that in the momentary tranquility attained by the after-effect poise [par avastha] of different types of Sadguru-instructed Kriya one experiences the Universe as the form of that Infinite Consciousness, one cannot see the naturally restless mind, not being able to be still in one way for any length of time, as being steadfast for an extended period. Therefore, O Chaitanya!! [Consciousness] I consider the complete focusing of this sense-desirous, naturally restless, uncontrollable mind for an extended period of time as impossible as stopping inhalation and exhalation. - 33 and 34-
