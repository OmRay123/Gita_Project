### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Renouncing all human and physical karma and the craving for their fruits equally, no types of concern arise in the mind; therefore, there are no corruptions of consciousness.  That is what is called the cessation of fluctuations in consciousness [chittavritti nirodha].  As in - shlokarddhantu prakshyami yaduktam tatvadarshibhih sarvachinta parityage nishchinto yoga ucchyate -    Jnanasamkalinitantra -no. 61- “yogashchittavrittinirodhah” -    Patanjaladarshane Samadhipadah - no. 2- In the yogic scripture of Hara Gauri Samvad, to the Divine Goddess’ question of “What is yoga?” - the Lord Mahadeva has said that I am only speaking half of what the seers of essence and realized in this subject of yoga - listen.  Having abandoned all thought and being in the state of tranquility is called yoga.  It has also been stated in the Patanjal Darshan that yoga is the state of the cessation of the fluctuations in consciousness. Therefore, the renunciation of all karma, and yoga, or the cessation of the stopping of the fluctuations in consciousness, are both the same thing.  Not renouncing all types of karma enjoined with the craving of results and performing action with all kinds of strong desires cannot in any way bring about the cessation of the fluctuations in consciousness.  Therefore, it is not possible for these types of renunciation-less sadhakas to have yogic union, or to be in samadhi. - 2-
