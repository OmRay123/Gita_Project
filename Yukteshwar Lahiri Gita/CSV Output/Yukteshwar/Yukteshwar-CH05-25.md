Commentary: Those sadhakas, who by having eliminated all doubt, and by the aforementioned yogakriya have destroyed ignorance, or unawareness, and thereby who experience the Consciousness-Self, by which who are united with the Self and perceive the oneness of things - up to the Ultimate - and are always present for works of the good - they are the ones who are merged in that Brahman-Substance. - 25-
