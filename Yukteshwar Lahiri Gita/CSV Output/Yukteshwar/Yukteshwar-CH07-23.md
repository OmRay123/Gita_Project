### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: All these desire-addicted jivas attain heavenly abodes suited for each one according to one’s desires of pleasure, meaning - limited bodily merriment dominated by some sense, or finite pleasure from being in some other part of Consciousness; by completing such actions, when one becomes happy from partaking in such wished-for enjoyments, only a short while afterwards, all pleasures occupying the body, or the powers of gods, become disarrayed and again the jiva becomes immersed in the ocean of sorrow. But the desireless sadhakas established in Atman-Consciousness, because of the revelation of the Eternal, Bliss-of-Knowledge-filled Infinite Consciousness, harmoniously fulfill the totality of all joys of all senses of the body and other demi-god consciousnesses situated in other areas, and reside eternally in Endless Bliss; there is no possibility that remains of destroying this Bliss. -23-
