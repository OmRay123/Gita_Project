### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The manifestation of this visible world from that Infinite Consciousness, meaning the creation element mentioned in the seventh sloka of this chapter, and the method to realize this Consciousness, meaning the way to go beyond this vaishnavi chakra maya and attain Brahman as stated in the eighth sloka of this chapter - the one who has become aware of all of this perfectly by his own realization does not have to take another body upon discarrding the present one. He can maintain the body and be beyond all desire. Thus he is filled with Pure Consciousness and merges himself in this all-pervading Infinite Consciousness and attains Brahman. - 9-
