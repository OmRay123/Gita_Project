### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Because of that, I fully prostrate to You. You are the Supreme. [IMPORTANT NOTE: From this point in sloka 11:44 through sloka 11:49, there seems to have been an editing error in the published Bengali printing transcribed from the original handwritten text. The printed commentaries are displaced - they do not concord with the appropriate slokas from this point in 11:44 through 11:49. Upon examination, it can be found that by aligning the commentaries correctly with their respective slokas, there should have been no commentary for sloka 11:49 in the published Bengali print. This translation presents the material in the manner in which the commentaries correspond accurately to their respective slokas and indicates that there is in actuality no commentary for sloka 11:49 in the published Bengali print. No liberties have been taken with the actual translation of the Bengali. The commentaries have been merely lined up. The reader is asked to understand that this part of the Gita, through the conclusion of the book, was found as a set of handwritten notes by Swami Sriyukteshvar Giri Maharaj and was not intended for publishing, and mistakes such as these by the printer could have occurred due to the difficulty in transferring the original handwritten text to the printed medium.] You are father, son, friend, beloved, god. - 44-
