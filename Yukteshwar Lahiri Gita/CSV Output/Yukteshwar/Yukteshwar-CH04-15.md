### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: One can attain liberation by doing Kriya while being ego-less, meaning knowing oneself as Consciousness and being uninvolved in all karma. Having known this, sages such as Janaka who desired liberation performed karmayoga in that way and acquired the fruit desired-for. Therefore, one should perform karmayoga in the ego-less manner that sages such as Janaka have done, because by that, the jiva can be easily liberated from the sufferings of samsara and attain Kaivalyapada. - 15-
