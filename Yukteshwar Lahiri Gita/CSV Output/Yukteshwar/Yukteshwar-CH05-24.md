### Commentary

Commentary: Those who have received initiation from Sadguru and have renounced all enjoyment of material things and have experienced Atman-Consciousness in the form of Light within, and those who engage in the performance of Kriya with inner joy and practice poise at the end of Kriya - those Kriyavan sadhakas by this type of Kriya eradicate all samskaras and attain the state of asamprajnata samadhi. Havinng attained the highest state of samadhi in this way, finally they merge into that Brahman-Substance and realize Kaivalyapada. About this, it is written thus in Patanjal philosophy: as in - viramapratyayabhyasapurvah samskarasheshohanyah - Samadhipada -  no. 18 - By the practice of the mind/intellect-ceasing poise, all samskaras are eradicated and one can attain asamprajnatavastha, the highest state of samadhi. - 24-
