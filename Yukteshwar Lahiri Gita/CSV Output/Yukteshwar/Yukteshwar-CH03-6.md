### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Those who want to be free of work in worldly life and live without doing anything, for which purpose they forcefully subjugate all of the organs of action such as hands, feet, speech etc., and try to be mute and inanimate, they are very ignorant; because their minds, ever-bound to habit, is always involved in thinking about sense matters.  Therefore, due to their lack of inner stillness, all of their efforts are useless. - 6-
