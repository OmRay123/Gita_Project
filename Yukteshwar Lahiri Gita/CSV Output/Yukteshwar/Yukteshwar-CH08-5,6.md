### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Because of the united power (resultant force) of the sum total of the fluctuations of consciousness at the time of leaving this present physical body, whatever feelings arise in the consciousness of the jiva that are felt at that time, previously powerless, become powerful because of the adjoining lack and need of fulfillment, and therefore that jiva thinks of his state of being as that [particular] condition; thus, the jiva assumes another body also based upon that discernment. This subject has been explained in the 70th sloka of the second chapter. For this reason, one who, having stopped all fluctuations of mind, abides in Atman Consciousness - he, even though he discards the unreliable body, because there are no causes of permutation of creation left, attains with certainty that all-pervading Infinite Consciousness-Beingness. There is not a bit of doubt about that. - 5 and 6-
