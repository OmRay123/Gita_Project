Commentary: When the body of providence is felicitated by yajna, and by which, when all desired objects are acquired by the manifestation of miraculous Divinity, if one does not use them for further advancement of the body of providence and thereby for the reduction of prarabdha [resultant manifestations due to the past], and only use them for even more enjoyment of the senses, one actually destroys oneself. - 12-
