### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Having observed the world-Brahmanda as filled with Infinite Consciousness, meaning filled with Brahman, the all-perceiving sages discerned that elements of a yajna [fire sacrifice worship] - the clarified butter, the fire, the performer of the fire incantations, the offering and the act - are all Brahman. In this way, the ones who are performing action in the state of samadhi in Brahman have no desire for any kind of result, and experiencing Brahman in everything, by this itself they remain merged in the Supreme Substance of Brahman. - 24-
