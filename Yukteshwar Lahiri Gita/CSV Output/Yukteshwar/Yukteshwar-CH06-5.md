### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: In this Universe, one is one’s own friend, meaning benefactor, and one is one’s own enemy, meaning malefactor.  Without effort by oneself, no one can do good or harm to anyone.  Therefore, to save oneself from this endless, suffering-laden sorrow of life in the world, one has to make the effort oneself.  One should not in any way become weary in the matter of Atman-Consciousness. This matter is very clearly expressed in a song by the Baul sect of the Vaishnava side.  A section of it is presented below.  As in - “(Come brother) see one’s own form by oneself Oneself has to cross over by oneself being the boatman Oneself is the criminal, oneself is the lord, oneself is intelligence and might (If one can) oneself goes (if not) oneself is does not go (O brother) oneself is all (See brother) oneself is Brahman, oneself is Shambhu, oneself is Srihari (Come brother) see one’s own form by oneself” -5-
