### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: This Eternal Consciousness never has birth or death.  He neither manifests nor presides, nor is He non-existent and non-manifesting.  He is Eternal, without birth, immutable, from time immemorial He is ever-new, meaning forever existing as He is.  Even the destruction of this body cannot bring about His death. - 20-
