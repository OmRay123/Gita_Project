### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: In this Brahmanda, there is no one who has the capability to prevent the force of the accumulated desires, meaning the prarabdha-bound fulfillment of karma.  Without their completion, the mind can not be natural in any way.  The ignorant, liking some of those enjoyments at the time of the fulfillment of prarabdha, desire for more of the same in the future, and disliking some things in which they must also partake, desire to be freed of that, which is another desire.  In this way, again and again, by their own design, they continue to create prarabdha like a silkworm and remain enmeshed in samsara.  But the wise ones renounce these types of likes and dislikes and fulfill prarabdha karma desirelessly in order to bring the pravritti elements who have taken the wrong road on to the path of Atman, and thereby return the mind to its natural state. - 25-
