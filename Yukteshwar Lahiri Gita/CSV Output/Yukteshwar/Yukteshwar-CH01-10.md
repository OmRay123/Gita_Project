### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Even though powered and protected by the frightening Abhaschaitanya, it seems that the side of body/ego is not formidable enough against the side of the five elements.  It also seems that the Consciousness-revealing side of the elements, protected by the power of the tremendous air element, will be triumphant. - 10-
