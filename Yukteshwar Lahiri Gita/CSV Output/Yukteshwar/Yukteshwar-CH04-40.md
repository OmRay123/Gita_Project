### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: For the persons without Kriya who are always thinking of receiving initiation from Guru at some convenient time in the future, or the ones who have been initiated but are not reverent towards the practice, or the ones who are reverent but are doubtful of the possibility of success by the practice - for them all work is corrupted; no work is successful. The doubtful persons are not able to understand the matters of the physical and subtle bodies through the experience of Supreme Bliss of Brahman within. Those who are engaged in such doubtfulness remain bound to the pleasures of ordinary things such as food etc. - 40-
