### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: It is true that for the ignorant and body-obsessed persons the senses become weakened through fasting and for a while they are able to turn away from external things; but because the mind itself does not turn away from worldly desires, once the senses regain their strength, they again become engaged in their objects.  The sthitaprajna ones, being in the experience of the Supreme Substance, remain apart from these meaningless desires. - 59-
