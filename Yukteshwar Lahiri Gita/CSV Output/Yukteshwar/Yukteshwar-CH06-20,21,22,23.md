### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The state where consciousness, by the performance of yogakriya, arrests its own fluctuations and transcends all things; the state where sadhakas, experiencing their own Consciousness-Self, are content in That Itself, and thereby attain the Eternally Permanent Bliss of Brahman which is beyond the senses and even the intellect’s grasp; compared to Which any joy of the highest nature of the world cannot be considered as any kind of joy at all; the state, if attained, where no profound suffering that may be present can unnerve the mind, and no other sorrow can even appear - this state of being is what is called yoga.  To attain this state, one should, with an assured intellect and an unrelenting consciousness, perform Kriya as instructed by Sadguru. - 20, 21, 22 and 23-
