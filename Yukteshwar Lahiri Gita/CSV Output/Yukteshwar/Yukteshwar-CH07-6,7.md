### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The material-Prakriti [physical-Nature], by whose mutation all things of this Universe have arisen, and that which, having taken recourse in Consciousness-Nature [Chaitanyaprakriti], is existing filled with life - both are only the Power of that Infinite Consciousness; therefore, that Infinite Consciousness is that which is the place on which this world-Brahmanda emerges, and if this Prakriti-mutation is destroyed either because of the passage of the ages or by some other cause, then this world-Brahmanda dissolves in that very Infinite Consciousness; thus, this all-pervading Infinite Consciousness is also this vast Cosmos’ place of dissolution. Therefore, nothing in this Cosmos is greater than this all-pervading Infinite Consciousness. Like jewels strung to thread, this immense Cosmos with Brahmanda is existing because of the Presence of that Infinite Consciousness. - 6 and 7-
