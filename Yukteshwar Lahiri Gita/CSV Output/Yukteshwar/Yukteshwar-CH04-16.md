### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Even great pundits become confused trying to discriminate between which karma is dutiful and which is not dutiful, and are unable to so discern. Therefore, one should remain absorbed in the Kutastha with a still mind and become aware of the distinction between these dutiful and non-dutiful actions. Understanding the secret matter of this and practicing regularly, the jiva can be liberated from the bindings of this worldly life. - 16-
