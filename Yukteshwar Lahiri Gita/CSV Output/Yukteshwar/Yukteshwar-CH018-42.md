### Commentary

Commentary: Calmness, discipline, austerity, purity, tolerance, uprightness, knowledge, beyond knowledge, and faith in God - these are characteristics of Brahman*-action/work. - 42- *[Translator’s note: The author has used the term “Brahman” [Divine] here and not the term “brahmin” [name of caste], even though it refers to the work of “brahmins.” It is understood that a true “brahmin” is one who lives in “Brahman” - a philosophy that supersedes the system of familial lineage which is commonly followed in India.]
