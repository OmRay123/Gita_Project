### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Because of no desire or attachment arising in Atman-Consciousness, one cannot be bound by any karma in that state. The one who can perform all work while being aware of Atman, meaning knowing oneself to be Atman-Consciousness, can see that all work is being done by vaishnavi maya chakra or natural law; and knowing the Self to be uninvolved from all action [karma], he desirelessly performs Atman-Kriya. He does not again have to be reborn because of the bindings of karma. - 14-
