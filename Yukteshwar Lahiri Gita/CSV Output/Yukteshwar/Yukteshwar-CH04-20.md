### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The one who, having renounced karma and its fruits, remains in the contentment of Eternal Bliss and does not take refuge in any matter of the body or the senses - meaning that he is uninvolved in body-oriented subjects, even though his body or senses are engaged fully in all kinds of karma - does not perform action, meaning that because he is separate from all of those bodily senses, he resides in detachment and satisfaction. - 20-
