### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Being without Kriya and failure in Atman-dharma will be a tremendous disrespect to embodiment, meaning one will suffer much.  For one who is a part of the Omnipotent Brahman-Consciousness, it is better to die than fail at Atman-dharma and eternally suffer as a slave to the elemental substances. - 34-
