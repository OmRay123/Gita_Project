### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: All of the bhoga-oriented pleasures that arise from the union with sensory things are the source of all of the types of suffering. They manifest as sorrow; even at the time of enjoyment there is sorrow and misery; even the samskaras [tendencies] because of these are filled with suffering. And because the minutely manifesting sattva, rajas and tamas guna-connected characteristics are fighting with each other, these pleasures remain only for a minute amount of time. It is for this reason that the discriminating wise ones never are attracted to these. It is expressed in this way in the Patanjal philosophical treatise: as in - parinamatapa samskara duhkhairgunavrittibirodhaccha duhkhamevasarvavivekinah - Sadhanapada -  no. 15- This has been clearly explained in the commentary to slokas 16 and 17 of this chapter. It is unnecessary to mention it further here. Thus, only the sutra is being stated. - 22-
