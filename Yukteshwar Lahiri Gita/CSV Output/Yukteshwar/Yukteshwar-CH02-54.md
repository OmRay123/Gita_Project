### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Experiencing all of these things, questions arise in the energy of the fire element:  who are the sthitaprajna*; how do they hold themselves and even, how do they move? - 54- [*Translator’s note:  “Prajna” is the conglomeration of mind, consciousness, intellect, discrimination and wisdom.  “Sthitaprajna” is the merged and still “prajna.”  Because there is no adequate parallel in English, this definition is necessary.]
