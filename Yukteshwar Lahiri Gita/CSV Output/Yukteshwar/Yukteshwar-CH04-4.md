### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: When all this is revealed in the Kutasthachaitanya, the experience occurs in the fire element that - first, the sadhakas experience the sun through Kriya; then when there is stillness in the sun, the Kutasthachaitanya is revvealed.  Thus, how is it that I am seeing the sun before the revelation of the Kutasthachaitanya, and then the sun united with Consciousness in the Kutasthachaitanya. - 4-
