### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Because of not being able to practice residing for long periods of time in the Bliss of the Atman-Self and not being able to fully realize vairagya, meaning that because their consciousnesses were not yet able to renounce the tendencies and inclinations of external matter and thereby were not able to attain the vashikaravastha and were not able to eternally experience the infinite Bliss of Knowledge-filled Brahman-Consciousness all at once, according to each one’s greater or lesser experiences of Consciousness, some such sadhakas take birth in houses of high beings who are pure of mind, successful in living without lack, and are fit for the yoga of Consciousness; some take birth in the houses of Sadguru-graced Kriyavan sadhakas, and some take birth in the houses of those wise ones who are filled with Eternal Bliss and are absorbed in the yoga of Consciousness.  Such types of births in this physical world are extremely precious. - 41 and 42-
