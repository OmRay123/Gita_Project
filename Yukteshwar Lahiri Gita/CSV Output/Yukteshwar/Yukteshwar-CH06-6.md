### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The one who has saved himself from being enslaved by mind, intellect, senses etc., and who is free and established in Atman-Consciousness, meaning the one who has been able to be successful in maintaining one’s true identity - that one is the supreme benefactor of himself and his own friend, and the one who, by having broken away from Atman-Consciousness, is controlled by tendencies under the enslavement of  all types of desire-filled mind, intellect, senses etc. - these types of beings, who have resigned to make effort in the attainment of Atman-Consciousness, are themselves their own malefactors and their own supreme enemy. - 6-
