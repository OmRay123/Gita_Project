### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: With the Prakriti-guna-based senses being deluded in ego, ignorant persons think themselves to be the doer of all work actually being done by the senses.  Self-realized beings should not be distressed by such short-sighted mentality.  Otherwise, there will be disrespect for work, and lacking knowledge, very destructive and corrupted possibilities will arise. - 29-
