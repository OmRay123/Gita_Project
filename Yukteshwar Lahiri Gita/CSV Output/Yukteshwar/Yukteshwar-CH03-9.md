### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The action that is performed with the intention of the revelation of Consciousness is called yajna.  Besides that, performance of any karma of worldly desire causes one to remain bound to samsara for the fulfillment of its results.  Therefore, one should do work that is devoid of the desire for the enjoyment of its fruit, meaning only the desireless practice of yogakriya. - 9-
