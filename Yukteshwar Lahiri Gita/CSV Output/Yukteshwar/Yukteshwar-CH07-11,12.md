### Commentary

[*Translator’s note: The first line of sloka 7:11 in some renditions of the Bhagavad Gita is written as: “balam balavatam chaham kamaragavivarjitam”] Poetically: The strength of the strong that is beneficent I am the lust where there is nothing adulterous - 11- The essences - sattva, rajas and tamas From Me do all of them emanate I am not in them; I am beyond all gunas From Me do all things come into being - 12- Commentary: The desire and the pure, unattached, sattvic strength of the powerful ones, and the natural ways of all creatures which are necessary for the maintenance of the body, such as the desire for food etc., and even all of the sattvic, rajasic and tamasic qualities by which this Universe is appearing - all of these are existing as manifested because of having taken recourse in Kutasthachaitanya; but Kutasthachaitanya is eternally and gracefully existing by Itself, with no dependence on anything. - 11 and 12-
