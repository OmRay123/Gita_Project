### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Engaged in the Soul-Consciousness revealing Kriya, dying brings the heavenly pleasures of the highest samskara, and victory, meaning attaining perfection through Kriya, reduces this entire elemental world into a game of dolls.  Therefore, it is one’s duty to resolutely perform Kriya with all-out effort in the power of the fire element. - 37-
