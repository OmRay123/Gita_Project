### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Thus, as yogis are superior to the austerity performing ascetics, the scriptural scholars with knowledge from outside sources, or the fire-ceremony-performing Vedic ritualists, one should take refuge in the Lotus Feet of Sadguru and, with the aid of the fire element, perform yogakriya. - 46-
