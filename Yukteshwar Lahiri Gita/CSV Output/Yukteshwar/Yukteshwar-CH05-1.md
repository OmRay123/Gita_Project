### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: When all that is explained in the previous chapter is experienced via the Kutasthachaitanya, a question arises in the force of the fire element: “O Kutasthachaitanya! Once I see that all karma must be equally extinguished; then again I see that performing Kriya in order to stop the fluctuations of consciousness is the imperative duty. Therefore, please show me with certainty which is the best of the two.” - 1-
