### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The saints who are knowledgeable in yoga compare the consciousness of a sadhaka seated in yoga [yogarudha] to a lamp, the flame of which burns steadily and without perturbation in a place devoid of wind.  This means that as the lamp remains steady and without perturbation in a place devoid of wind, the consciousness of sadhakas seated in yoga and united with Atman-Consciousness also reside in that state of motionless steadiness. - 19-
