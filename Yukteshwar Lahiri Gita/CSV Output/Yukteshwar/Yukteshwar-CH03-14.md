### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Food, meaning the ever-sustaining nectarous thing that is the object of all desires - from that all of the elements in the body are nourished and content.  This nectar emerges from the Sahasrara, the spirituall cloud.  And that thousand-petaled lotus is revealed in full bloom by yajna.  This yajna happens by the Guru-given Kriya. - 14-
