Commentary: When the mind is stilled by Kriya, all work of heavenly pleasures and all work of hellish suffering are destroyed.  In this way, having eradicated all fruits of karma and being devoid of all sense enjoyments, Kriyavan sages are liberated from the chains of life and attain supreme peace.  Therefore, one should perform this Kriyayoga, the highest of all actions. - 50 and 51-
