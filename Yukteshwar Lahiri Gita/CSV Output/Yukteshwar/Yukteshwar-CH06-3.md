### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Sadhakas wishing to stop fluctuations in consciousness should perform the Sadguru-instructed yogakriya.  But when the cessation of fluctuations in consciousness has been attained, in order to extinguish all those causes of fluctuations in consciousness, they should remain in the highest unknowable samadhi and by that practice non-attachment again and again, and end all types of physical and human karma.  As in - “viramapratyayabhyaspurvah samskarasheshohanyah” -  Patanjaldarshane Samadhipadah -no.18- Practicing supreme non-attachment again and again, which is the form of the means of coming to rest and thereby ending all samskaras, that highest of all asamprajnata samadhi state becomes present. - 3-
