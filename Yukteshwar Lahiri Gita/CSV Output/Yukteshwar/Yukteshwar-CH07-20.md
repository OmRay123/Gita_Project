 --- 
Commentary: Because of being under the power of each one’s individual samskara [acquired inclinations]-bound character, the intellects of jivas become weakened by the many types of desires arising from such character, and to fulfill all those wants, they take up many types of practices with great care in order to manifest some miniscule merriment of the body as demanded by certain senses, or some small experience of a part of Consciousness. - 20-
