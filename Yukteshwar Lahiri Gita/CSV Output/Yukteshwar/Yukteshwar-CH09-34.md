Commentary: Enjoying that Infinite Consciousness Itself, being devoted to It and humbling themselves to It, sadhakas surrender as offerings their minds and lives to Spirit by the Consciousness-revealing Kriya and live filled with Atman-Consciousness. - 34- SUMMARIZED DESCRIPTION OF CHAPTER 9 Keeping the mind absorbed in Kutastha in this way and becoming empty of hatred and condemnation, this supreme happiness-giving, directly obtained, highest of all, extremely secret, and greatest wisdom which is Spirit is experienced. Jivas are liberated by It from the sufferings of samsara. And lacking It, the irreverent ones are repeatedly enslaved by life and death [1 - 3]. Like air in the sky, Infinite Consciousness unabsorbedly pervades created things and thus sustains and governs them. But the strange mystery is this: even though it is existing in Consciousness, the phenomenal world is abiding un-Consciously [4 -6]. The Consciousness-imbued Prakriti keeps this three-guna-entranced phenomenal world under the power of ever-repeating creation and dissolution; but Infinite Consciousness, being aloof and detached from the works of creation, is not enmeshed in that [7 -10]. Stupefied by the hope of useless pleasure, or useless enjoyments of indulgences, or useless argumentative scriptural knowledge, the ignorant ones acquire demonic characteristics, and not being able to comprehend the Supremeness of Infinite Consciousness, perceive It in the form of created things [11 - 12]. But the ones of wisdom, knowing Infinite Consciousness as being before creation and Imperishable, take refuge in the subtle nature and do upasana - some in the dvaita [dualistic] form, some in the advaita [monistic] form, and some in many different ways. And devotees remain steadfast and engrossed, humbly worship That and do upasana while singing Its praises [13 -15]. Infinite Consciousness Itself is the fulfilling wealth for this realm, the fulfilling funerals for the realm of the ancestors, and the fulfilling oblations and the articles of ritual for the realm of the gods; It is the mother, father, grandfather and Lord of this world; It is the Knowledge of Pranava, and It is the three Vedas providing the way to that Knowledge, and It is That Which is to be Known. It is in Him that this world’s creation, preservation and destruction take place, and He is the Primordial Seed of all. It is He Who is the giver of heat and the creator of cold; and it is He Who is residing as the Creator and as the created things [16 - 19]. The brahmins who perform Vedic rites perform yajna with the desire to attain the realm of heaven; attaining which, they partake in enjoyments in the manner of the gods, and after the benefits of good works end, they again acquire a physical body. In this way, they are trapped over and over in samsara [20 - 22]. Infinite Consciousness is the Lord of all rites and It is their enjoyer. No matter what god is worshipped by one, beyond the rules, he is actually worshipping that Infinite Consciousness. Whatever aspect to which one does upasana, whether gods, subtle aspects, physical aspects, ghosts etc. - one attains that state of being. One who with one-pointed heart does upasana of Consciousness - his finds his Spirit Self-revealed and is bestowed that state of being. It is because jivas do not know this that they are repeatedly bound by samsara [23 - 25]. Whoever uses whatever for the sake of Consciousness, by that itself Spirit is pleased; therefore, if one can submit all works of the world to Spirit, then by that Spirit is pleased and one can attain the Beingness of Consciousness. Thus, one no longer has to be trapped by the fruits of good and bad karma [26 -27]. Even persons of the most vile character, by doing upasana to Consciousness, within a short time become righteous in Atman and attain Infinite Peace; in this type of condition, they should be considered as the highest of sages, because by them abiding in Consciousness, even though Infinite Consciousness is Omnipresent, It reveals Itself to them [28 - 31]. What to say of the sanctified souls of brahmins and devoted royal sages, even the greatly downtrodden uneducated and farm laborers attain that Supreme Substance by taking up refuge in Consciousness. Therefore, one should know Infinite Consciousness as the Supreme Substance, and with one-pointed mind and devotion, humbly bowing to It and doing upasana to It, attain that Infinite Consciousness-filled Brahman [32 - 34]. Thus ends the ninth chapter of the yogashastra upanishad Srimad Bhagavad Gita with analysis via various scriptures of this country and the West, along with spiritual commentary.
