### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Being free of doubt and focused in the Kutastha in this way, when one wants to know about karma and akarma, one becomes aware of: the karma to perform which is according to the rules of the sadhana of liberation and what its form is; the action that is forbidden; and what is the renunciation of karma. One should be particularly aware of the secret of this. One should not base one’s discernment on popular theories prevalent, because the hidden truths of karma according to established rules, forbidden karma and the renunciation of karma are quite unknown. Not to speak of ordinary people, even great pundits are unable to understand these matters. This has been stated in the previous sloka. - 17-
