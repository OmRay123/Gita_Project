### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The mystery of creation is such that, even though that Infinite Consciousness is the Self in all created things and is manifesting them by holding them and ruling over them, It is not bound to the created things and is residing as not in them; and even though these created things are internally and externally soaked in Consciousness, they become un-Conscious and endlessly travel through samsara via birth and death. - 5-
