Commentary: By the practice of such withdrawal of the senses, when the mind attains tranquility and the purity of the sattvic condition by having become free of the scattered-ness arising from rajoguna and the sleepy, drowsy/laziness arising from tamoguna, sadhakas become able to live in Supreme Bliss. - 27-
