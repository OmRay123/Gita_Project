### Translation 
 --- 
Those who cannot remain, being under the control of the senses His mind cannot be in the Atman Who is not in the Soul has no peace How can the restless have the Bliss of Brahman - 66- In the middle of the senses is the mind Undisciplined, it roams about Its intellect easily becomes ineffective The way the wind tosses about a boat in the water - 67-

### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: It is written in the Patanjal philosophical treatises that the wisdom that becomes illuminated by the impurity-eroding performance of yoga is called “viveka.”  As in - yoganganushthanadashuddhikshaye jnanadiptiravivekakhyateh -   Sadhanapada - no. 28 Therefore, without the erosion of impurity by performing Kriya, viveka does not become manifest.  When viveka is not present in this way, there is no stillness in meditation.  And when there is no stillness in meditation, one cannot attain tranquility.  And without attaining tranquility by turning consciousness away from sensory objects, happiness can never be experienced.  Because, if the senses are restless, the mind follows them and like an incompetent sailor whose boat is at the mercy of the wind on the ocean, it engages the intellect in the sense objects. - 66 and 67-
