Doing karma surrendered to Brahman Uninvolved in sin or beneficence, this is the truth As water does not touch the lotus petals In that way no sin touches him - 10-

### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: All work in this worldly life is being carried out according to the law of that Infinite Consciousness. Unless by one’s own desire, one takes it upon oneself, no one has to partake in the results of such work. Understanding this, the wise renounce all desire for results and do work desirelessly. Because of this, like lotus petals above water, they are not caught up in any sinful or beneficent results of the liberation-obstructing karma done by the body and senses. - 10-
