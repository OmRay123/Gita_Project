### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: As consciousness stays immersed in Kutasthachaitanya, even more is experienced -  that:  the one who, having renounced all craving for all types of results, continues to do all karma [action] - he is the definitive sannyasi, and he is also the definitive yogi.  Yajna by fire, or renouncing different kinds of work annd being without action and sitting under a tree does not make a sannyasi or yogi. - 1-
