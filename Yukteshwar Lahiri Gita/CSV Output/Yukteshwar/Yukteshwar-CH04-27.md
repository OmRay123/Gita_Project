Commentary: By the self-discipline of dharana, dhyana and samadhi, through which one lights the fire of discriminating knowledge, and being immersed in the experience of the object of meditation - the Supreme Brahman-Substance, the devoted meditators dissolve sight, sound etc. of the organs of perception, speech etc. of the organs of action, and even the work of inhalation and exhalation of pranic functions, and thus eradicate all restlessness of the body and senses. - 27-
