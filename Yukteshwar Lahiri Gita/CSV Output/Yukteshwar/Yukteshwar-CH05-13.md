### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: By the previously mentioned way, those who are victorious over the senses realize themselves to be apart from the senses of the body. They renounce all karma equally in their minds and reside happily in the bodily city of nine doors - mouth, dual openings of the nose, dual openings of the eyes, dual openings of the ears, and the urinary and excretory openiings. Such a being as Self is not engaged in any karma, and nor does he cause the body and senses to become engaged in any work. - 13-
