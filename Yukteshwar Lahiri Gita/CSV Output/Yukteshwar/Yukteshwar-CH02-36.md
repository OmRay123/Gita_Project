Commentary: When there is no success in the realization of this All-Pervading, Omniscient, Omnipotent, Lord of Creation, Preservation and Destruction - Atman - then it is possible to have many vain and erroneous feelings rise in the mind, such as “Atman is insubstantial” or “It is just another quality of the phenomenal world”, like the Buddhists or agnostics. - 36-
