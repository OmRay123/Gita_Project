### Translation 
 --- 
I am overcome by the power of pity and guilt Confused about dharma I ask You What is truly best please tell me Teach me, your disciple who has taken refuge in You - 7- I cannot see any way, thus I turn away In this grief by which my senses run dry It matters not if I receive the whole world over Uncontested kingdom and rulership over gods - 8-

### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: In sorrow, the power to do work has lost its energy.  Uncontested/unhampered, meaning without obstacles and able to anything, meaning the strength of the elemental physical body or even lordship over the entire subtle body will not relieve me of this grief it seems.  Therefore, O Kutasthachaitanya!  My character has been tainted by the flaw of pity, meaning that I am unable to do any harm even though I might gain immensely by doing so, and my consciousness is devoid of Brahman-Consciousness.  I take refuge in You with all that I can do.  Please teach me what is truly for my good. - 7 and 8-
