### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: The one who performs Atman-Kriya desirelessly and free of ambition has all of his karma burned in the fire of Knowledge begat of Kriya, meaning that the jiva as a non-doer does not have to be bound to reaping the fruits of karma. The knowers of Brahman refer to these types of Kriyavans as all-knowing sages. - 19-
