### Commentary 
 --- 
Commentary: Abiding in Atman via meditation - meaning pranayam 1728 times - some with the Kriya of Atman - see Atman. [IMPORTANT NOTE: The last part of the commentary to this sloka 13:25 - beginning at this point - becomes misaligned and is mistakenly printed under sloka 13:26 in the published Bengali print. Upon examination, it seems that the displacement continues through sloka 13:27 and that there seems to be in actuality no commentary for 13:27. This translation presents slokas 13:25 through 13:27 in the manner where the alignment has been adjusted according to the aforementioned discernment of the translator. If this is a mistake, then the translator takes full responsibility for it.] Some by Samkhya - meaning see Him via jnana yoga, whose work is Yonimudra. - 25-
