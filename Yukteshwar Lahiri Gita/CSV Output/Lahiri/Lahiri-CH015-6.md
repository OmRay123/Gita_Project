### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]7) It is in a fragment of My Atom that all living people exist as jivas, becoming Shiva Himself, Eternally Present, but the five senses and mind - these six - the body’s five elements, mind, intellect, ego - that, by whose nature this is happening - in that itself, with oneself not abiding in the Self - meaning, not performing Kriya - becoming bound by the gunas of Prakriti, being attracted and filled with attachment to other things - meaning, in the direction of sense matters - mind pulls forth that with desire, and makes it present.
