[Commentary:]6) One who, by Kriya, has been able to still oneself - he is his own friend, and one who does not keep himself in Atman, meaning does not perform Kriya - he is his own enemy - know that that is verily oneself - because if one does not constantly perform Kriya, there will be death.  What enemy is there other than death?
