### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]26) Without desire - Brahman is doing - the Stillness after Kriya - always remains Tranquil within.  “Utsaha” - with the upper - meaning, in Kutastha, enjoined all the time; if some sense thing is spontaneously seen, or if something happens or does not happen - in both of these, he is Still, abiding in the par avastha of Kriya - there is no mutation in mind - this type of doer is called “sattvic doer.”
