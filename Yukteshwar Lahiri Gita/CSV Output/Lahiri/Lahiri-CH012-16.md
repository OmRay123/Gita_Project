### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]17) The one who, abiding in the par avastha of Kriya, is not pleased at anything - is not hateful about anything - does not desire - renouncing both good and bad - which happens automatically to drunkards - having received this type of Kriya via the teaching of Guru - in the work of the Self Itself - the Self is dear to Itself.
