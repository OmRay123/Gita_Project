[Commentary:]29) The Lord of doing all karma [work] is Kutastha Brahman - He is the One who is the Enjoyer - He is the One who remains as Himself in Himself - this is what is known as “tapasya” - meaning remaining in Kutastha - He is in every person - being a jiva itself means that - for this reason, in a different form It is Maheshvar - residing in all beauty in the heart of everyone (prana itself)* - knowing this, one attains Peace, remaining in the par avastha of Kriya - meaning, neither am I anything, nor is anything mine.[*Translator’s note: The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]ity srimadbhagavadgitasupanishatsu brahmavidyayam yogashastre srikrishnarjunasamvade karmasannyasayoganama panchamohdhyayahThus ends the Fifth Chapter.
