### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]10) In this way, one who always remains lodged in Atman completely and without breath, with all desires ceased - the state that happens after Kriya - one who meditates like this, knowing that there is nothing at all other than Kriya - I unite him in samadhi with stilled mind - by which the ability to be aware of the extraordinary and wondrous experience is attained.
