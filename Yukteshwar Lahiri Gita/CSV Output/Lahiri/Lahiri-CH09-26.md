### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]27) Whatever you are consuming, whatever you are giving and the rites that you are performing, offer all of it to Me - meaning, Brahman is Itself doing the acts of Brahman - I am not doing it - this is what is known as offering [“arpan”].  Not knowing all of the time that I am that Brahman - meaning, if Knowledge of this type which comes about spontaneously from continuous performance of Kriya is not there - then offering of this type does not happen - who - offers to whom - Brahman offers to Brahman Itself - meaning, Eternal Stillness Manifested.
