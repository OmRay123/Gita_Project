### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]16) If, in the body - which is the manifestation of Omkar, one does not perform pulling and dropping, he is not able to know Stillness. One who does not have this condition - he does not stay in his own body; thus whether at home or abroad, there is trouble (you can plainly see it). The state beyond these two - then there are no words - going beyond matter one becomes the witness of the Supreme Substance, meaning - one becomes a knower of Brahman.
