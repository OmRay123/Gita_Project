### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]14) Meditating upon the God Kutastha, going to Kriyanvita persons, residing in Atman, going to someone to whom full awakening has happened from Kriya, “pujanam” - performing Kriya - abiding in Brahman; “arjavam” - being simple - meaning speaking what is in the mind; “brahmacharya” - residing in Brahman only; not being saddened because good has happened to someone else; these are “sharirik tapasya” [tapasya of the body].
