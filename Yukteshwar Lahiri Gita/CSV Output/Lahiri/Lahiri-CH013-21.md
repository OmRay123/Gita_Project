### Commentary

[Commentary:]22) That Maheshvara is Himself Guru; that country which cannot be found can be seen through the teachings of Guru - it is when Stillness occurs in that Particle of Brahman that one can see the Infinite, Cosmos-pervading, Universal Form of Brahman.  It is He who is the Lord of Sustenance for all - meaning, the Lord of Sustenance for oneself is the Self Itself - even after knowing this, like fools, people say, “Oh God, oh God! How can I can carry on in this samsara,” and uselessly pass through time in this way.  People think, “I am eating from having earned it.”  But one is obviously and clearly seeing - which people do not see even after looking - that a dead person does not eat - He is residing in me, and thus it is He who is eating; and that the One who is eating is also the One who is eating all things in all places, having taken the form of jiva - there is a bug in the teeth of even the exemplary [even seers do not see/no set precedents show perfection]; He is the One Brahman in all phenomena and in jivas, and is spoken about as Maheshvara, Jaganmay, Jagannath, Brahmamay in all scriptures.  If one abides in Him, one becomes He Himself - that, which even though known in the par avastha of Kriya, cannot be found by anyone - therefore: Avyakta [undefinable, unspeakable].  Only - after 1728 pranayams, yogis are on the way of dhyan.  It is He Who is the Kutastha after Self.  It is in this very body that one can see One Supreme Person after Kutastha, via knowing Kriya through the teachings of Guru (in this body).*[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.][A reminder to the readers:  all bracketed - [ ] - statements are from the translator, unless otherwise noted, and are used for the purposes of clarification, whereas all statements within parentheses - ( ), unless otherwise noted, including the parentheses themselves, are in the original commentaries.]
