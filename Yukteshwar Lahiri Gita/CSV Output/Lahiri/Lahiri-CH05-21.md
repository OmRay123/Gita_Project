### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]22) Because of “bhoga” [partaking or enjoyment of sense-matters] - that momentary bhoga that happens from engaging the mind in a direction other than vital air - before and after that bhoga is sorrow - as in sexual intercourse - birth, death - at the beginning and at the end - in both there is sorrow - wise ones do not indulge these types of karmas [partakings].
