### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]30) When in the Knowledge of Brahman all separate and different phenomena become one, and [it is known] that all are residing within that One Brahman-Atom - thus, all of this extensive samsara then becomes Brahman.  In One Atom is All, All is in One Atom; then there is nothing other than Brahman.
