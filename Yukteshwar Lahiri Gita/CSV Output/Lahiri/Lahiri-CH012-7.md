### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]8) It is Me where the mind should be kept - meaning, having stilled the intellect in the par avastha of Kriya, enter it with extinguished silence - after penetrating with extinguished silence in this way he will definitely become “I” - with infallible certainty - and will go above - meaning, he will abide sitting on top of the head - there is no doubt about this.
