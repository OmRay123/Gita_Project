### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]7) Thinking one time “I will do” and then again thinking “I will not do” - those who do not perform this Kriya, they get these kinds of feelings - they do not remain in Brahman - meaning, there is no certainty in any matter - do not remain in any one character of behavior - lying only, cannot speak the truth - Truth is not with them at all.
