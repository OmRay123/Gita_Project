### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]38) Sense objects and the senses - meaning, upon looking with attachment with the desire for results, it first seems that “I am saved; such an excellent thing I got” - saying such, one goes on with sexual intercourse; but fixing the mind thus that: “I am immortal; I won’t die; will I die?” “One who tells me ‘die’, let him die” - one who does not ever think about death, he will die, and the one who says “die”, how can it be that he will stay alive?  Meaning, both fall in the jaws of death; nevertheless, like children, they think of false talk as true; thus the talk itself is evil, which they cannot stop speaking - but in the par avastha of Kriya, one automatically becomes mute [silent].  In the end, after that sexual intercourse, putting the penis in some rotten vagina, a flaming irritation like poison comes about - this is what is known as “rajasic happiness.”
