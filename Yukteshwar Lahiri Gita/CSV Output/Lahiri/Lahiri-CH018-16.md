### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]17) In the par avastha of Kriya, when, even though one is staying in the Self, one is not - staying in that incredible condition, the Still Intelligence does not get engulfed with attachment to any other thing - even if he kills all people, he does not kill - nor can he be bound because of killing - because: he was not in himself - he was in the intoxication of Brahman, like a drunkard in the intoxication of liquor.
