### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]12) Good, bad, and good and bad mixed - three kinds of fruits of actions - those who have renounced all three of these verily - one who is a renunciate of the present condition and the future - it is he who can renounce these three; but sannyasi, who has only renounced the present condition - he can never renounce those three - because his desire for liberation and such in the future is there.
