### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]8) What is Jnana [Knowledge] but the vision of Kutastha [Kutstha Darshan] - Vijnana [Wisdom, beyond Knowledge], meaning when one’s self abides in the par avastha of Kriya and  is supremely fulfilled - abiding in Kutastha - victorious over all senses - this is called “remaining locked in Brahman” - yogis say this - when a clod of earth and gold are realized to be the same - like the way it is to a drunkard.
