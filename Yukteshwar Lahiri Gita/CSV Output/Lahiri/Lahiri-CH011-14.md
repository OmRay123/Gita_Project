### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]15) It is being experienced by the energy of the body - spontaneously by itself, he continued to see that in this body itself, in Kutastha (deva = space)* all phenomena exist completely - Brahma**- Vishnu - Mahesh; sages - all - birds.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.  The word “akash” was translated as “space.”  The word “deva” was left in Sanskrit, because it is the word being defined from the first line of the sloka as equivalent to “akash,” or “space.”][**Translator’s note:  “Brahma” refers to one aspect of the Divine.  This should not be confused with “Brahman,” the Absolute, which is beyond all aspects.  This differentiation in spelling is used throughout this translation.]
