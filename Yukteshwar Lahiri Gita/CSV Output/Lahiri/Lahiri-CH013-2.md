### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]3) That body - which is in its own form - and which, when mutated, [is] whatever kinds of forms in the phenomenal world - is hidden in all people - meaning Kriya - always residing in Atman - this is called “kar” [the original] - “vikar” [mutation] is putting attachment-filled attention elsewhere, by which there is the mutation of mind and manifestation - listen about all of this.
