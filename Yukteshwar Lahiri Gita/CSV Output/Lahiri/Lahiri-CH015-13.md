### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]14) As fire in the body - upon equalizing prana and apana in My Body and remaining lodged there is when the four categories of food happen - “cha” - “charvya” [food that is chewed], “choshya” [food that is sucked], “lehya” [food that is licked], “peya” [food that is drunk] - I digest; as long as that fire is in the body, a person is alive for that long; as soon as life is gone, fire is gone (one is dead - people say that one has become cold),* but fire in this form in this body is blazing even in Kriya - in contemplation of the Self - careless - if one is not careful even with the lighting of fire, then let it catch on to what it may.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses -( )- and the text within them are in the original.  The bracketed -[ ]- comments are the translator’s, used for the purposes of clarification.]
