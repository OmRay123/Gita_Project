### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]44) Only performs Kriya, the “go” sound refers to the tongue; keeps that raised to the top and performs Kriya with the desire for results; those who act while staying in the par avastha of Kriya in this way - they are “vaishya.”  And those who simply abide in Atman for the sake of having this very worthy Kriya and perform action in this way are of the “shudras” - abiding in that Atman Itself, they abide Tranquilly.
