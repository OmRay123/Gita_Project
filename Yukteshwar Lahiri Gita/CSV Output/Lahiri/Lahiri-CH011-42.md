### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]43) You are the Father of all people - meaning, the Creator of mobile and immobile things - You can bring [the jiva] from the darkness of the Cosmos and samsara into Light - I am directly witnessing that - it is You Who is “pujaniya” [worthy of worship] (“pa” = Yoni Muladhar, “u” = endowed with Shakti, “ja” = abiding in Kutastha = it is this that is called “puja” [worship] - meaning, puja must be performed with prana - [the knowledge of] which is transmitted via Guru)* - there is no one equal (second)** to You - how can there be something greater.  No one at all of these three worlds can create an image of You - because nothing at all can be like You.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original, except the bracketed term “worship,” which has been used for the purpose of clarification.][**Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
