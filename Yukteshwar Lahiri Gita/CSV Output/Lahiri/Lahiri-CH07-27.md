### Commentary

[Commentary:]28) Those who do not look elsewhere and who are not filled with attachment - they, because of such, abide in Atman - [they] perform good karma, meaning perform Kriya.  He extinguishes conflict and delusion, becomes freed from them, and goes beyond the Indestructible, meaning becomes Stilled after Kriya.
