### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]22) It is being experienced via Kutastha - there is a certain kind of Revelatory Light in the par avastha of Kriya, where there is neither day nor night - it is in that Light where the heart goes completely; being imbued with that Essence one is like a thoroughly inebriated drunkard, having turned the heart from all other directions and being enraptured by That Substance; thus, all of the desire to stay in That - neither is that [desire] there, nor is the desire to not stay [in That] there - mounted on top of the head and sitting there, as if: who knows who is sitting there - sitting there like this - these three gunas - meaning, ida, pingala, sushumna - are not actually operating - meaning, in the subtle form in the Brahman Nadi, these gunas are in this kind of oneness in the par avastha.  One who knows this - it is he who goes to My Essence - meaning, however much it is possible, the par avastha of Kriya is being described (which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru - the sign of “ru” is Total Stillness).*[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
