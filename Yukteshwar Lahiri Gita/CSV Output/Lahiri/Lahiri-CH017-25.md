### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]26) In the Truth Essence, simply remains locked in Brahman alone - stays at the sadhana of Kriya ceaselessly - it is they who become merged in Brahman from the continuous practice of Kriya.  Completely residing in the par avastha of Kriya, no karma remains at all in the state of Peace; thus, nothing at all engages the mind except Brahman.
