### Commentary

[Commentary:]9) If one always abides in Atman - meaning, performs Kriya, happiness arises in all ways - abiding automatically and naturally in happiness, one attains the Supreme Bliss of the par avastha of Kriya.  The Bliss about which no one has the ability to speak - the reason why It is “avyakta” [unspoken] - known by oneself - later cannot make anyone know.  The temporary fruits which come about through rajoguna with its desire for results - meaning, “this land is mine for a hundred years and there is no assurance as to whose it will be after that - the land is ten hands long, three and one-half hands wide, for which ten people will be murdered and how much will be the profit?”  The one who, by berating over and over about this becomes poor - this type of hobbyist-poor is the worker of rajoguna.  It is in this type of karma [action] that so many people are caught up - and who is this “I”?  And what is Atman?  That, even by mistake, does not come to mind from the time of birth until death - yet there is the sound of “gyan-gyan, ghan-ghan” [noisy bleating of pseudo-knowldege]; telling people “because I am rich, I will be wise,” and being like this.  Thus, filled with attachment, he pretty much spends all of his time on other things and discussions and such.  Whatever is left - that is lost in the snores of sleep, hidden every day in undisciplined state, and he lays fallen in deep darkness - therefore, it is because there is no Light that one has to live in darkness.  The Light which one must search for with self-effort.  Even knowing and hearing about that, he says things like, “I love to stay in that darkness” - “I have money, I’m eating, enjoying, shitting fluidly, I’m quite fine.”  Living in this type of indulgent darkness of falsehood and being intoxicated in this for a short time, death comes and grabs him like a bug.
