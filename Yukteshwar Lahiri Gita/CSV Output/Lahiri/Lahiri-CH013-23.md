### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]24) After the performance of 1728 pranayams, one can see the Pure Atom of Brahman-Self.  Some, upon the continued performance of innumerable pranayams, can spontaneously and naturally see Atman; other people become disengaged with everything else, and not putting mind on attachment-filled directions elsewhere, simply by abiding in the Self, see the Atman automatically - that which is called Samkhya yoga - that is also the purpose of this Kriya; other people, devoid of the craving for results, completely engaged in dharana, dhyan, samadhi, perform this Kriya (which is transmitted via Guru)* and automatically and naturally see Atman.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
