### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]3) Power - meaning the power of mind, by which all is seen and done - not paying attention to any sense objects, bestows mercy - remains Tranquil in OneSelf; always resides in Brahman - does not knowingly cause harm to others - does not have lust for great honor; what little [honor] there is, is natural and appropriate - all these - continuously abiding in the par avastha of Kriya, residing always in Brahman, all of these states of being are attained equally.  This is what is known as “daivi sampad” [Divine Qualities/Possessions].
