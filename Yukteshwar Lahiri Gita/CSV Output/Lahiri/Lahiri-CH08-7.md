### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]8) Gradually, through the continuous practice of Kriya, accomplishing dharana, dhyan and samadhi, and thus being lodged in Atman - the par avastha of Kriya - as the mind, by itself, will not go in any other direction - then, like the sky itself, the human-shaped Supreme Person -Who is the Lord of the world - one is able to see with continuous focus in the Atom of Brahman.kavim puranamanushasitara-
