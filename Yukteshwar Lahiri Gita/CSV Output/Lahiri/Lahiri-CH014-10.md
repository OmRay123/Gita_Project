### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]11) If attention is there, then the Light of Atman can take birth in all of the senses [gates] of this body.  That Knowledge of Kriya is happening, which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru.  That “vidya” [knowledge] is truly vidya; all else is “avidya” [ignorance/not-knowledge] - meaning, knowing that is truly knowing, and all else is not-knowing.  When that Kriya expands is when one resides in sattva guna.
