### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]15) Attaining Me, birth does not happen again - that birth which is the house of nothing but sorrow - that also does not remain forever.  Attaining that Substance, meaning - being completely one with the par avastha of Kriya - that small self - I am this - going to Brahman one is the Great Self, meaning - “all is Brahman” - being like this, the completion of all things is attained, meaning - no desire arises for anything - necessity/meaning does not remain - especially for superfluous things - continuing to abide in this state - the Supreme Way, meaning from the Yoni to the head vayu is stilled and one is merged.
