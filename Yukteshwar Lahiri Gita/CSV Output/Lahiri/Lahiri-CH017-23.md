### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]24) Thus, if you perform Self-Kriya via this very body, you will see that oneself has spontaneously become Still after Kriya, and oneself has surrendered to Brahman, and has established Itself as the Form of Its True Self in Kutastha Brahman - meaning, the par avastha of Kriya - those who are of Brahman, abide constantly and everywhere in this type of karma [action/work].
