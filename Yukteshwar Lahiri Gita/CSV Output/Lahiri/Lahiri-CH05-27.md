### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]28) During all work, senses will remain controlled - mind and intellect - they will also be controlled - those people who are like this - they are united to liberation and are non-doers - this is what is called “jivanmukti” - liberation while alive in the body.  One who lives devoid of desire, devoid of fear and anger - he is ever free.
