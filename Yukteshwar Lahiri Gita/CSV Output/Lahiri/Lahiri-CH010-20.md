### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]21) Among all the lights that exist, the Tranquil Light Manifested -  that is Me - meaning, the state which is after Kriya - the Particle of Brahman is inside the particle of the sun - the subtle vayu that is within energy - that is itself My Form - the Particle of Brahman is within all - among the stars that can be seen, the Great Moon is My Form.
