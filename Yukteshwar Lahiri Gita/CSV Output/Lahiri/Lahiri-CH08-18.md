[Commentary:]19) All phenomena - having been created, become completely dissolved - if one stays in a different direction - that by which all have to remain in a paralyzed condition - those who do not perform Kriya - when Kriya is again performed, out from the darkness, the True Revelation of the True Self is attained.
