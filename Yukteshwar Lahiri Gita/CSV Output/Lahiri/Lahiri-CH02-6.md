### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]7) I am very miserly, because I crave results from every action. I do not give one penny to anyone without expectation of something, thus, the actualization of craving results - which is the mind being attentive elsewhere, meaning that I have destroyed the absorption in Atman, meaning Stillness, thus I cannot know what type of thing dharma is - for this reason I am asking - similar to a stupid (good)* person - stupid because of this: I cannot keep the mind steady in the chitta within - what is good amongst these, meaning remaining with the senses or vanquishing them - tell me that which is good, meaning make me experience it, because I am a disciple, meaning that I always perform Kriya, and I lay always at Your Feet, meaning Kriya itself.[*Translator’s note: The parentheses and the translated text within them are in the original.]
