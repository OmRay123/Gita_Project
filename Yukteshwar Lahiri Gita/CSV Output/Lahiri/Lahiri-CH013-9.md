### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]10) Just by abiding in the par avastha of all Kriya, it will happen by itself - keeping mind on Kriya and not putting attachment-oriented attention elsewhere is what one should do - attachment-oriented - meaning, just putting attention elsewhere besides Atman - thus, all miscreants and wrongdoers are those who are not in Atman - always [doing] Self-Kriya, the contemplation of Self, attention to Self, Self-Knowledge - that happens by the work itself.  In the midst of all being naked, one wears a cloth - he is the one who is ignorant.  Solitude - meaning, not putting attachment-filled mind in any other direction and not looking at people with attachment [conditionally].
