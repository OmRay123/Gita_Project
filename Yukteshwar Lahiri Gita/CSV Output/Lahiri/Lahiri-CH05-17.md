### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]18) The rice of the good, educated and humble brahmin holding his container of holy water and holy grass - and the food of one who has killed a dog for his meal - seeing who these two pandits [knowledgeable ones] are as the same - meaning, for him [the sage] both are same, because, like a drunkard, no analyzing of any thing in the world remains in the par avastha of Kriya.
