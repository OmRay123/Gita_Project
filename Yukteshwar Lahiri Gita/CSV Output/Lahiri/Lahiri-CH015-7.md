### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]8) What one gets, what one lets go - the body - focusing in the heart, with attachment to sense matters, with desire - unknowingly, like when people’s noses suddenly sense a scent, but because of what was that able to be experienced - people do not meditate upon that, yet the scent has come by that vayu - and some scents are expelled and some scents are received - like that, going to another thing with attachment; it is desire itself that is the root phenomena of that - meaning, the restless mind - by oneself not staying in the Self and going for a trip, one is bound because of oneself!!!  Like this:  a bird on a riverside is filled with thirst and desires to drink water from a birdfeeder - he takes up this kind of wish - on two sides of the birdfeeder are two sticks, and on top is the birdfeeder; that birdfeeder is in a cone; as soon as the bird sat to begin to drink the water in the way he wanted, he immediately spun around - flailing with force, he again got up there, and again fell trying to drink the water; doing this over and over in this way, the bird-hunter came and easily captured him - in the same way, becoming covered in samsara with the thirst of desire, flailing as one sits on the two sticks of ida and pingala - enveloped by karma - Death came and grabbed him.
