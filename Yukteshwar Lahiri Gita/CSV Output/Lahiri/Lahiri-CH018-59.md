### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]60) One’s own self is suffocatingly bound in one’s own karma - like: if you abide in Brahman, then you will go to Brahman; if you put attachment-filled attention in another direction, then you will go there - perform Kriya well; you will receive excellent fruits; if you are deluded and have put attachment-filled attention in other things and do not abide in Atman - then, after going through birth, death and suffering, becoming powerless and coming to peace, you will have no choice but to do this Kriya - because there is no way other than this.
