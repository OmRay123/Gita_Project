### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]11) The Garland of Space - the Scent of Space - all are astonishing - in this way, he went on witnessing the Divine Kutastha.  Infinite Cosmos - the eyes of people living in samsara - those who have become perfected - all of them are gazing at Kutastha - which of course means that they are the Manifestations of Kutastha Itself; there is nothing there other than Kutastha.
