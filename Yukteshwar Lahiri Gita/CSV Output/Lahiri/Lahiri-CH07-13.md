### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]14) Divine, meaning - continuously abiding in Kutastha Brahman, divine qualities are attained - My maya is in Atman - looking at another thing, cannot see anything but Brahman - meaning, can see if remaining in Atman.  If distant from Atman, cannot see.  Whosoever abides in My Self at all times - he is the one who rises above my maya, meaning goes on performing Kriya.
