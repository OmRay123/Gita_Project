### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]9) He is the Composer - the Primal Person - the Atom of the atom - (the particles of earth dissolve into the particles of water - the particles of water into the particles of fire - the particles of fire into the particles of air - the particles of air into the particles of space - the particles of space into the Particle of Brahman - from one part of the Particle of Brahman - the three worlds, as Mahadeva - is One Brahman). All creation is manifesting from that Brahman - there is no way to attain Him by thinking - because unless there is two, there can be no thought, and Brahman is One - thus, without abiding in the par avastha of Kriya and becoming One, it does not happen. For this reason, the scriptures say “Ekam Brahman” - how is He - like Space as the Sun - after that is Tama (darkness)* form (Yonimudra)* - He is Kutastha Brahman, about Whom all Vedas and Vedanta speak - this is attained through the teaching of Guru.[*Translator’s note: The parentheses and the translated text within them are in the original.]
