### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]17) After abiding in sattva guna - meaning, after performing Kriya, the Still Substance of the Knowledge of Brahman is known in the par avastha of Kriya.  Rajoguna - meaning, when one is in ida, then, because of the heart going in the direction of performing action with the craving for results, one desires the attainment of that in every way - this is what is known as yoga - staying in pingala causes one to be thoroughly maddened, intending to kill one person, kills another - being mesmerized towards that thing - oneself not knowing OneSelf - thus, unconsciousness happens in tamoguna.
