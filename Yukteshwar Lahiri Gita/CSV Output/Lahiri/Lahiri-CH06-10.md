### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]11) The Pure Land, meaning remaining in Brahman - stuck - being still in the seat of the heart - (keeping Self, sitting in the abode)* - neither too low, nor too high, meaning staying in the middle place - the heart - the holy grass [kusha], meaning Brahma,** whose place is the Muladhar - deer-skin - that which has skin on top of it - Krishna, gracefully abiding in the root of the lingam in the Svadhisthana.  Soft cloth [chel], meaning silk, which - when rubbed in a dark room in the winter - gives off a light like fire.  That is Rudra, royally abiding in the area of the navel, Manipura - above that, you will take your seat upon the asana of the heart.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.] [**Translator’s note:  “Brahma” [pronounced “Brahmaa”] is the name of the creator aspect of the Supreme, as opposed to “Brahman” [pronounced “Brahm(a)” - very short “a”; “n” is only a nasality] which is the symbolic word for the Absolute Supreme.]
