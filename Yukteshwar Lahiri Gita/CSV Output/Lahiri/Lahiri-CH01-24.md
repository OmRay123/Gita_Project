[Commentary:]25) One’s own force of will and fear are right in front of one’s face - they are manifesting as many soldiers.tatrapashyat sthitan partha pitrinath pitamahan acharyanmatulan bhratrin putran pautran sakhimstatha* shashuran suhridaschaiva senayorubhayorapi - 26-**[*Important note: The numbering of the slokas in this chapter from this point on can differ in various renditions of the Gita. In some popular versions, the asterisked point marks the completion of the 26th sloka. In this version of the Gita, the sloka is not completed until the next line. Therefore, in some Gitas, the total number of slokas in the first chapter is 47, whereas in this version of the Gita, the total number of slokas is 46. However, the total text in either type of the Gita is the same. There are no omissions. The apparent unevenness of this sloka 26 is balanced out in sloka number 36, being another three-line sloka. It is necessary to point this out since readers might be following this translation with either the Sanskrit or transliterations of other versions of the scripture and the numbers may not coincide.**In some Gitas, this line is the first line of sloka 27, as previously mentioned.][Commentary:]26) The energy of the body is seeing little fear and great fear, customs carried out throughout lineage, desire in all things, hatred towards others, imagining about all things beforehand, resolve to remain bewildered in Maya, lies on top of lies, evil tendencies [and acts], ridiculing and such - the opposite of these on the other side - these are the two parties [for battle].
