### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]42) Now I am speaking about everyone’s karma [type of work] specifically - “shama” = the par avastha of Kriya; seeing everyone as the same, and vanquishing the six senses; abiding in the Kutastha Sky - “shoucha” = residing in Brahman; from all sense objects - meaning, refraining from action with the desire for its fruits - speaking only what is in mind - “jnana” = seeing in Yonimudra - upon seeing, remaining in the par avastha of Kriya, where there is no day or night or anything - seeing everything there - [that there is] something, or that there is God, Brahman - one who knows in this way is the one who verily does the work of a brahmin - oneself abiding in Stillness in the Self in the par avastha of Kriya.
