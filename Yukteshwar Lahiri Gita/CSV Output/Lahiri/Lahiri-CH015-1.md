### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]1) It is being experienced via Kutastha - the root is above, branches are below - the head is above, arms/hands and legs/feet are below - in this way is the banyan tree-like human body; the poetical meters are reversed - meaning, all those bushes and sticks that can be seen in Kutastha - those leaves; one who knows Kutastha in this way is the one who truly knows the Vedas; and again -2) The branches from below - meaning, nadis, all of which have gone above - meaning, to the head; gunas - meaning, that ida, pingala and sushumna have become fully extended - all the sprouting that can be seen in Kutastha (deep blood)* - it is they who can be seen as rishis in the star within the Light of Kutastha - trying to go above from below - they begin to perform karma [action] with the desire for results and thus, human beings become bound by their very own actions [karma].
