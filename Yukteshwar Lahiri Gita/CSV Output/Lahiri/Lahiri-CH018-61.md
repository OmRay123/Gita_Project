[Commentary:]62) That One Who has taken up the three gunas - it is He Who is the Self - remember Him verily.  Having received Kriya via the teaching of Guru, seeing Brahman in all things in the par avastha of Kriya - continuously practicing Kriya in this way, residing in the par avastha of Kriya and attaining Bliss - after which there is no more - you will attain this Peace-Substance quickly, and through Intelligence, you will be able to know with absolute certainty that other than this, there is no other path to Peace - this understanding will be there always.
