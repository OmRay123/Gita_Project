### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]54) Becoming Brahman, just by its happening, oneself is in delight, because he does not at all put attachment-filled attention on other things besides Brahman; when he does not put attachment-filled attention on any thing, then there is no regretful grief about that other thing; it is when attachment-filled attention is given that one desires to acquire that [thing] - when there is not even attention on any other thing besides Brahman, then consequently, there is no craving for that either - sees Brahman in verily all phenomena, mobile and immobile; then all experiences happen spontaneously by themselves - having faith in the teaching of Guru, he resides as Himself in the Self and always performs Kriya, and thinks of that itself as fortune gained, the attainment which is the Wisdom above all.
