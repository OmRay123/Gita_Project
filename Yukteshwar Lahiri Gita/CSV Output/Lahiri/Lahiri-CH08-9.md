### Commentary

[Commentary:]10) At the time of death, with the mind having faith in the teachings of Guru, remaining embedded in Atman, with dharana, dhyan, samadhi, with power, if one enters completely in the prana-vayu in the middle of the eyebrows, then - Sat - one sees the Supreme Person - (attained through the teaching of Guru)*. Doing so in this way, Bhishma and such have cast off life, meaning - performing Omkar Kriya in one breath twenty-thousand seven-hundred thirty-six times (20,736)* bursts the Brahmarandhra - doing so, one attains the Supreme Substance - which is attained through transmission by Guru.[*Translator’s note: The parentheses and the translated text within them are in the original.]
