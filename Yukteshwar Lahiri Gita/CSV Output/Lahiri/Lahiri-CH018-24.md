### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]25) Like the way of being mentally tied up before falling asleep - in this level of karma, in which there is destruction - and cannot see others’ good - “anapeksha” = has no regard for others - meaning, does not act with awareness of what is all around - showing off this kind of manliness, in delusion, begins action in this way - this is called “tamas action.”
