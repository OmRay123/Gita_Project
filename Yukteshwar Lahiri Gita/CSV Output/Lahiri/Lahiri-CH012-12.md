### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]13) Do not hate anyone - what is enmity for drunkards? See everyone as yourself in the form of the Kutastha and do that which will elevate Kriya - I am nothing, nothing is mine - just by the work of staying in the par avastha of Kriya, the ego is not there at that time - sorrow and happiness are known as the same in intoxication - if someone says something, he is forgiven by stating “let him say it” - meaning, does not care about it, like a door squeaking “k(n)yatch k(n)oatch.”*[*Translator’s note: The “n”s in the last two words indicate the nasal quality of the squeaking door, and these words are transliterations from the original.]
