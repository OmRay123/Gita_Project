[Commentary:]28) In this way (as the same),* one who sees Brahman established in everything everywhere - he, with Self by the Self - not ruining - meaning, not attending in other directions - performs Kriya, which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru; after that, he attains “Paragati” [the Way which is Beyond] (meaning, the Stillness after Kriya).**[* and **Translator’s note:  The parentheses - ( ) - and the text within them are in the original.  The bracketed - [ ] - statement in the commentary to sloka 13:28, is the translator’s, provided for the purposes of clarification.]
