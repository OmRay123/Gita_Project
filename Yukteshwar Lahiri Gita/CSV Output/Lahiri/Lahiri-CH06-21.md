### Commentary

[Commentary:]22) Gaining which, one does not feel [the acquiring] of anything else as gain, meaning Supreme Gain - this is what is called “attainment” [prapti] - this is the reason that all scriptures (“apti” [obtainment] - in truth, apti is prapti)* say that the words of the truly aware should be honored - where, when all eight parts of the day and night are stilled, even when there is tremendous sorrow, that attainment, meaning gain, is not affected - (meaning even if I am terribly distressed, I do not let go of Kriya).**[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them except for the bracketed word are in the original.  The bracketed word is the translator’s, for the purposes of clarification.][**Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
