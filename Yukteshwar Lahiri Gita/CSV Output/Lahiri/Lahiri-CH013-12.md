### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]13) It is in that state that one can go anywhere one wishes - as intoxication remains in the subtle body throughout the eight sections of time [throughout the day and night], whatever is wished - one can see that within and have - meaning, one sees that in front of the eye - one can go to inaccessible places and see - one can experience everything - one can taste everything - one can know what amount of what is in what substance (mixed)* - because then he becomes Brahman Itself - Brahman is hidden in all things - although one is sitting in one place.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within is in the original.]
