### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]10) First, one kills a person - having killed, he begins to grieve; in this way, covered by rajah and tamoguna, he takes up sattva guna - meaning, he comes to Benares [Varanasi] and becomes a Brahmachari [celibate monk] - because he has killed, he wails “oh! oh!” - from rajo guna, he comes to sattva guna, and then again he begins to say, “What will wailing do? I killed. So - fine. I did” - he comes to tamoguna from sattva guna; later he thinks that “What I did was not very good” - and again he comes to sattva guna from tamoguna.  Now, the one whom he had killed - people come again to fight on that person’s behalf - thus, from sattva guna, again he comes to rajoguna - death takes away these types of “palm-leaf soldiers” with the blow of one breath.
