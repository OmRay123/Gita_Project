### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]15) That is the “rishi”, meaning the Supreme Person Brahman - He is beyond all - the vayu is still there - one who has attained the Still Vayu, meaning dead body - no pain happens to that. In that way, no pain happens to that Kutastha at all - and a dead body has no pleasure or sorrow, is lying still - in that way, Kutastha also has no pleasure or pain - Still!!! but Immortal!!! Those who have attained this are called “gods.” Thus, gods are immortal. One whose third eye, meaning Divine Eye, has merged in Kutastha - they are the ones who are “jivanmukta” while in this body, and therefore immortal.
