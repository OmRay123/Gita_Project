[Commentary:]20) One who performs Kriya and sees the One Eternal, Indestructible Kutastha Brahman in all phenomena - even in separated conditions sees as one, and sees that all of the different jivas are Brahman everywhere - this is what is called “sattvic jnana” [sattvic knowledge] - meaning, this Knowledge happens in the par avastha of Kriya.
