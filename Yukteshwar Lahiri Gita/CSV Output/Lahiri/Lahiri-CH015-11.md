### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]12) The power of the sun, which has come from the sun - all is seen by that - in the same way, the power of Kutastha being in the body, is revealing Itself in the body - that very power is the Form of Brahman - which has come from space - but nothing at all is being able to be seen in space; yet in the middle of that space itself, in subtle form, the Supreme Ether Manifest - in each single atom are many Forms of Brahman’s Particles; within them there are many universes - among those universes, you are one person - you cannot figure out for yourself how small a being you are!  You have absolutely no end to your boasting; what you are, you yourself cannot say!  In this way, in the atoms of the energy of the moon and the sun are verily My Form - when this is able to be seen is when the Knowledge of Brahman happens.  It will not do to speak of the experience of this type of state without performing Kriya - when there will be experience, there will be understanding - meaning, the par avastha of Kriya.
