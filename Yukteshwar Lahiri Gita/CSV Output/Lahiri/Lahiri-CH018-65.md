### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]66) Do not look in any direction with attachment; only keep mind in Atman, and having received Kriya via the teaching of Guru, go on doing it - go on with remembrance - OM - with the continuous practice of this Kriya, I will liberate you from looking in other directions with attachment-filled attention - meaning, in the par avastha of Kriya, attention does not go in other directions at all; for this reason, do not worry about anything.
