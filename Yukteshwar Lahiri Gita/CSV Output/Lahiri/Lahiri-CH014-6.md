### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]7) “Rajah” - meaning ida; attachment-filled desire in some other thing - if it happens via Atman, it happens - if one prays for, wishes for and looks at that thing for a long time, one has the desire to have that thing with great expectation, which, when one does not get it, causes one to become extremely desperate.  That is what is known as “trishna” [thirst]; that thirst has bound you up quite well and is making you stand with hands joined together [in the form of prayer].   Because, by that thing, “my mind will have the fruit of satisfaction for a little while.”  In this way, that standing form is fulfilling karma in desire - within this body in the Form of Kutastha - meaning, Mahadeva’s - like some person standing in front of a confectioner’s shop.
