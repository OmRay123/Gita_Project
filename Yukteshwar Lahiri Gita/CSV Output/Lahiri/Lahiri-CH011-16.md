### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]Description of Kutastha17) On Your Form is the Crowned Form everywhere - six Manifestations with the Mace - pervading everywhere - round like a wheel - the Power is also immense (Infinite)* - Endless Light - like fire - like the sun - like lightning - like nothing else - this Light does not need to be proved - the world is lit by the Light of that Kalachand [Sri Krishna] - no one ever has seen this kind of Light (boundless)* - (the blessed go there; what to talk of humans being able to go).**[* and ** Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
