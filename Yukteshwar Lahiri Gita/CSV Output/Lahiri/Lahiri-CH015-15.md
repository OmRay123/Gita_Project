### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]16) In this person are two beings, one destructible and one indestructible - the one who is residing with attachment-filled other attention [on other things] - he is destroyed; and the one who is residing in Kutastha - he is “akshara” - meaning without destruction; for this reason, all people are destructible; only those who are in Kutastha all parts of the day and night - it is they who cannot be destroyed - the One Who is established in Trikuti, the One Whom no one can see, only transmitted via the teaching of Guru - can be seen via the Eye of Guru - unless shown, cannot see.
