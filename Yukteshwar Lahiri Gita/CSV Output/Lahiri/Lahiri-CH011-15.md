### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]16) I am seeing the many arms of everyone - many bellies of many people - many mouths of many people - many eyes of many people;  I am seeing You everywhere - the Infinite Form - there is no end - as far as I can see - I am seeing [Your Form] - there is no end to seeing - because there is no end, there is no middle - therefore there is no beginning either - for this Lord of all the world and the Cosmos.
