### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]17) Continuing to look at that Kutastha, one later sees one Supreme Person - Who is called by the scriptures as Paramatman; Who is heaven, earth, underworld - the three worlds which are in this body (from the big toe to the navel are the seven underworlds; from the navel to the throat are the seven “dvipa vasundhara” - earth and the physical/mortal planes; from the throat to the Brahmarandhra are the seven heavens)* - entering this, putting on a skin shirt, is looking after one’s own maintenance fully - meaning, whose mind - whatever it wants to eat, that it eats - He is Eternal Indestructible; because He is all-pervading in the subtle-form - if there were some other substances besides It, then there could be change; when all is verily One, then for whom is there destruction - it is He Who is Ishvara - Lord; is doing everything everywhere in the form of jiva, yet is not doing anything at all in the Form of Subtle Brahman - the doing, am I doing - know that such is in the physical form only; that is not Eternal.  OM.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
