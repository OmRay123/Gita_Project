### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]12) “Jneya” - meaning that thing which is to be known - Kutastha Brahman - I am speaking about That in depth - knowing which, one attains My Substance - That, which has no beginning - meaning, the intoxication - of the par avastha of Kriya - one does not know when it began; then there is no “me” in the Self; He is ParaBrahman; the Eternal Certainty beyond all - then truth and untruth both - are absent - meaning neither the seen nor the seer are there.
