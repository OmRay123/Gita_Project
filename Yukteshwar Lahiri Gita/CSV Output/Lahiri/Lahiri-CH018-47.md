### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]48) The work that has happened along with birth - meaning Kriya (which is only acquired via the teaching of Guru)* - that is what is duty, in every way (mercy, mercy)** - trying to do that in the beginning, does not quite happen completely - meaning, one cannot do Kriya very well, but one should not discard it just because of that - like when starting a fire, first smoke gets in the eyes and causes a little discomfort - afterwards, one cooks, eats and is filled with satisfaction - in that way, in the beginning, there is a little discomfort in keeping mind in Atman, but after eating and becoming filled with satisfaction, that discomfort from smoke is no longer felt; forgetting that, one instead receives satisfaction in abundance.[* and **Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
