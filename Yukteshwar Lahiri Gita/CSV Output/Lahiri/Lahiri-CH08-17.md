### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]18) When day and night - meaning that ida and pingala are still, and the movement is in sushumna - then this type of state is attained - he always resides in the state of Vijnana [beyond Knowledge] - where there is no day and night - yet the revealing Light like that of the day - like that - all forms that he sees, even the holes/cavities in them can be seen.  When one is not in this state - then nothing at all can be seen - that is what is known as “night” - when the sight, filled with attachment, verily goes to other things instead of Brahman - then it is “avyakta” - meaning - cannot comprehend anything at all.
