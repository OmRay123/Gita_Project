[Commentary:]5) One who does not perform Kriya and performs intense austerities such as “panchatapa,”* egotistically boasting with desire and anger, and does so with force.[*Translator’s note:  “Panchatapa” refers to performing severe austerities under the hot sun along with large fires burning on all four sides.]
