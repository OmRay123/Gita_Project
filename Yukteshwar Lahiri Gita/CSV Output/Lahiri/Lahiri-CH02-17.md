### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]18) The body has its demise just as a bubble also has its demise. As long as there is air, there is existence - then death - but the water-exemplifying Brahman has no death because He is Indestructible - and there is no comparison to Him either. If there were some substance other than Brahman, then there could be comparison, isn’t it? Thus, that which is your work to perform, go on doing it.
