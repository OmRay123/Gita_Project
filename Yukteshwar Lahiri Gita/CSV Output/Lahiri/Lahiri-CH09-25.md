### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]26) The leaf of the “bel” tree - flowers, fruits, water - whosoever offers such to Me with faith in Guru’s words, I receive all of that - but offering while completely in samadhi - knowing the false as true - as when trying to get rid of an ailment one says, “say it is not there,” and again, “say it is not there” - but the one who is saying such is saying so knowing that it is false, but with the intention of making it true - in that way, knowing all of the works of this world (worship, almanacs)* to be false, they call it true and do such.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
