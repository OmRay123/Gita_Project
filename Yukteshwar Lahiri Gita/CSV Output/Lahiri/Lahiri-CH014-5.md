### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]6) There - meaning in the par avastha of Kriya – the five elements, mind, intellect, ego - it is in these that there is impurity - being without these and abiding in Atman is Purity.  Kutastha Brahman!!  When any thing becomes pure, Light is attained - the sword that has become rusted, if one cleans that via Kriya- which is transmitted via the teachings of Guru - such a Light manifests on that sword that one is able to see one’s own face. It is this that Patanjal has called in the Sutras as “Svarupa Darshanam” (meaning, in the natural mirror, the Self can see OneSelf)* - when the Self sees OneSelf and OneSelf becomes Brahman, then All is Brahman! And one sees All; thus the Light Itself is the Form - of Brahman! It is this that is spoken about in Vedanta as “Svaprakashasvarupa” [Light of Self-Revelation]. When all have become one thing, then how can there be any kind of destruction and another thing with an end - therefore - “avinashi” [indestructible] - devoid of mutation - if desiring attachment-filled pleasure from other things, He resides suffocated and bound in that.  Leaving that and residing as the Self in Atman - meaning, performing Kriya - there is liberation - meaning the par avastha of Kriya.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses - ( ) - and the text within them are in the original.  The bracketed - [ ] - text is provided by the translator for the purposes of clarification.]
