### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]26) White and black - this is the endless motion of the world. White - meaning day; black - meaning night, which has been expounded upon in sloka 24. But in the day - meaning in the Summer Solstice with intense Light - dying while seeing this - there is no engulfment - meaning rebirth does not happen - and dying while only seeing the moon, rebirth will happen - the sadhus who die while seeing the Light of millions of moons and millions of suns, lightning within fire all around, and after that Kutastha Brahman Purushottama - those sadhus to whom this happens, they are sitting in front of Kutastha even though death has happened - the people who perform this Kriya properly, for many of them, they have had darshan of all sadhus in Yonimudra. Thus, they have attained the Supreme Abode - many have seen this.
