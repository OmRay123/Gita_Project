### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]59) If you arrogantly do not do Kriya, saying, “I am a great person.  What need have I to do Kriya?” - yet, with the desire for fruits of actions, “I am going to heaven; I am going to Kailaspur” - “let this happen to me, let that happen to me, all this is a lie”; but conducting oneself in that kind of falsehood, one will again have to take birth; and consequently, later, one will inevitably have to do this very Kriya, when one will not see anything but sorrow and no permanence of pleasure in anything.
