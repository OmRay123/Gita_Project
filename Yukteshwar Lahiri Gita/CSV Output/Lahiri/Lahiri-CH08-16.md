### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]17) For great sages, pulling and dropping happens one thousand times during the day - it happens like that at night also - those to whom this happens are the ones who can be called “brahmin” - meaning - those for whom, from the continuous practice of pranayam, one pull and drop generally takes 44 seconds to happen.
