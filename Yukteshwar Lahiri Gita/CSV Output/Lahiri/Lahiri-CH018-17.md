[Commentary:]18) Knowing - the Substance to be known is Brahman - and the one who will know is this Atman - these three acts have been spoken about - meaning, performing Kriya and attaining the Knowledge of Kutastha Brahman - becoming the Self’s verily, meaning - the par avastha of Kriya; this is [true] work.  Cause means performing Kriya; work is performing Kriya and going to Kutastha Brahman - the One Whom that Self knows as Lord.
