[Commentary:]13) Not stilling mind fully in the [state] after Kriya, and not performing Kriya, and not performing Omkar Kriya - whatever is done - all are tamasic karma [acts/yajna] - meaning, acquire Kriya via the teaching of Guru and perform all acts [from that], otherwise it is all useless [meaningless].
