### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]27) Day and night - neither am I anything, nor is anything mine - fully remain in par avastha of Kriya - with dharana, dhyan, samadhi, abide in Supreme Happiness - then, in the par avastha of Kriya - I am nothing, nothing is mine - if one stays in this state, attention with attachment will not go in other directions - therefore, “sarvam brahmamayam jagat” [all that is - is Brahman; or, the entire creation is filled with Brahman] - being Brahman - one is sinless - meaning mind will not go to other things.
