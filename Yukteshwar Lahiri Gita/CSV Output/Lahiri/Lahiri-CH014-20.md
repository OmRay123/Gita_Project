### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]21) The energy of the body is saying - what are the signs of these three gunas?  And in what way can one be beyond them?  And in what way are these three gunas?  And in what way are people residing in these?  O Lord!  You are the One truly manifesting in this body - meaning, the Supreme Person - please speak.Sri Bhagavan said:
