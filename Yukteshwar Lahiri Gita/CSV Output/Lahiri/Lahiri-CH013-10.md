### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]11) Performing Kriya in Atman Itself - which is acquired via the teaching of Guru - the meaning of “tattvajnana” [Knowledge of the Substance] is just this - knowing and seeing the Revelation in Kutastha via Kriya - this is what known as “Knowledge” [jnana] - other than this, looking elsewhere with attachment is called “ignorance” [ajnana].
