### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]21) The air from outside remains outside - it is this kind of victorious Soul who experiences such great happiness - One Bliss of Brahman - it is in That that one is embedded, with dharana, dhyan and samadhi - and goes on through time in such happiness - a happiness which has no diminution or end [indestructible] - other pleasures have certain demise.
