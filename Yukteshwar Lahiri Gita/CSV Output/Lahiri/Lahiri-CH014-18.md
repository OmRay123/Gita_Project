### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]19) In the par avastha of Kriya - when ida, pingala, sushumna - who look in other directions - by which one’s attention is being constantly kept in that Atman - then, one goes beyond the three gunas, resides in ParaBrahman, and attains My Essence - meaning, becoming One, he automatically and spontaneously moves beyond intellect and goes to the Supreme Intelligence-Brahman.
