### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]19) Whosoever meditates upon Me (meaning, performs Kriya by the teaching of Guru, having had initiation)* - being unaware of every other thing - meaning, never forgets at all - it is he who knows Purushottoma - meaning, sees - he knows everything - and in every essence - meaning, in whatever he puts his mind, he sees Purushottama in that very thing - meaning, seeing Brahman verily everywhere, by abiding constantly in the par avastha of Kriya.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
