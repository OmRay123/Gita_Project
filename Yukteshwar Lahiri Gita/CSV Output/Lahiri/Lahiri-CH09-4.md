### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]5) My Form is Ishvar - looking elsewhere instead of towards Him - put your sight above this itself - so that this type of thing does not happen - meaning, do not look elsewhere - even while residing in the midst of all - in all conditions and circumstances - all phenomena are presently existing, yet not in Me - the restless mind is engaged in looking elsewhere instead of toward Atman.
