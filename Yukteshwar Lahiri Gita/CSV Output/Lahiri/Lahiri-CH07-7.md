### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]8) In the form of the liquidity of water, as the rays of the sun, the moon’s as well - the way that I am residing in Prakriti, it is manifesting in that way.  The good in good people - the bad in bad ones - as the power of the sun clearly shows on water - the image of the sun - and on leaves or on the earth one cannot see that image of the sun - only one aspect of it is seen - thus fire is purer than water - many things are being revealed in [by] that light - purer than that is air [vayu] - by which even more pure forms are being revealed [manifested] - after that is space whose stillness is the cause - the Immutable [Immovable] Form of Brahman - Kutastha’s - the Darshan [beatific experience] of Brahman is happening.  Thus, the radiance of the three - water, sun, moon - are My form Itself.
