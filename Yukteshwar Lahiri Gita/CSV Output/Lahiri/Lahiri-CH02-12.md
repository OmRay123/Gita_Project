### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]13) Who is the Dweller in the body but Kutastha - The One Who is Kutastha Brahman, as He is, so He is. The body is going through childhood, adulthood and old age - similar to a water-bubble’s beginning condition, middle condition, and destruction at the final condition. Those who are abiding with still minds in that water-illustrated Brahman - they do not become deluded by such mutations.
