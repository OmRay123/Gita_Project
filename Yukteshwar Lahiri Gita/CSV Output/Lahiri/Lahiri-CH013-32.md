### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]33) Just as one sun illuminates the entire earth, in the same way the Embodied One illuminates this body - (Note)* - as long as there is darkness - meaning, oneself’s attention, filled with attachment, is elsewhere, and the Atman’s sun-like illumination via Kutastha is not being revealed.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them is in the original.  The parenthetical is in English in the original.]
