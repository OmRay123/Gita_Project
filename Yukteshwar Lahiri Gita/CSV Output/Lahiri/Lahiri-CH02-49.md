### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]50) Reside in the paravastha of Kriya and let go of the desires of good and bad work. For that, remain in the paravastha of Kriya and do all work, because the work of yoga is of extremely fine skill, meaning keeping the eye in the head, keeping breath still in the breast and doing all work.
