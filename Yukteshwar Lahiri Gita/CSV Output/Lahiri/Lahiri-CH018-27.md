### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]28) Does not stay in the par avastha of Kriya - without staying locked, becomes stuck in any or another thing; being stuck, like a helpless doll, consciousness is hit with confusion and such - cannot perform a single act - cheating with verily everyone - always in laziness only - mind always heavy with sorrow - so if not today, I will do it tomorrow - after this, when I am old, I will think about dharma and good works - this type of condition is of a “tamas doer.”
