[Commentary:]2) The soldiers of this body - soldiers are: forehead, face, breast, fingers, muscular folds in the belly and throat, ears, thigh, hair, flank, mouth, neck, navel, eyes, arms, nails, buttocks, back, nose, womb, feet, vagina, throat, chin, breath, knee, shank, eyebrows, the place between the eyebrows, ankle, hair, neck, skull, hand, windpipe, speech, teeth, flesh, skin, bones, veins and nerves, all nadis [meridians] - among these there are twelve main nadis: Hastini - in the right ear; in the left ear - Gandhari. Alambusha - in the right eye; in the left eye - Pushpanasha. On the right Pingala, in the middle Sushumna, on the left Ida, in the tongue Saraswati, in the lingam = Baruni in the Muladhar, Kuhu at the door of the anus - the currents of all these nadis are the forms of soldiers - if there is no river, what kind of current is possible; their names as mentioned in the scriptures and such - I am writing sequentially. 1: Ida - Ganga - 2: Pingala - Yamuna - 3: Gandhari - Kaveri - 4: Hastini - Sindhu - 5: Pusha - Tamraparni - 6: Alambusha - Gautami - 7-8: Sushumna - Saraswati - 9: Kuhu - Narmada - 10-11: Baruni - Gomati - 12: Payasvini - Punpuna. Seeing all this, Duryodhana - the one who does not want to perform Kriya, who is enslaved by ignorance, who thinks of himself as the greatest by hearing by the ears - the acharya Dronacharya - he sees only one way, meaning determined to do whatever has been handed down by lineage and only that - the intelligence close to this [witnessing this] and moving about internally, understood this and let it be known.**[Translator’s note: The repetitions of the names of the body parts in the first part of the commentary to sloka 1:2 are in the original.]
