### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]4) Internally boasting as one of high caste/class - going about puffing out one’s chest [throwing around one’s weight] because one has strength - praying for more honor than what is natural and appropriate - remaining angry all the time - saying cruel words - and not abiding in Atman - meaning not performing Kriya - these are all “asuri sampad” [demonic qualities/possessions] - meaning, those who do not perform Kriya - for them, this type of character and behavior happen automatically.
