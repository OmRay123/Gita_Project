### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]4) All of those yonis from which all forms are coming about - those are singular and separate yonis - in those yonis too is Brahman; they also emerge from Brahman - but I am That individualized and Unified Great Yoni [Mahadyoni] - I am verily Its Seed, the Atom of Brahman Itself, and “pra” = in True Form - in the “da” sound is Yoni; it is in That that I keep It - meaning, I keep Self in the Self - which is the par avastha of Kriya - again, I am [also] the Father - meaning, endowed with Shakti, bringing My Form from within Me - the Form of Kutastha - Brahman!!!  Meaning, Son - meaning, Father; the Father is Himself the Son!!! The Son is Himself the Father!!!
