### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]16) Does not look in any other direction - does not have desire for that either - always remains in Brahman - abiding in the paravastha of Kriya, sees Kutastha in all and as the expert in every kind of work - sitting on top of the head and abiding there, remains devoid of any kind of affliction.  When there is desire for non-essential karma [action] - at the very beginning of that desire, because of abiding in Brahman - via the absolute intoxication - [the desire] is discarded by itself [automatically], because those pleasures are momentary, after which there is no happiness - abiding in the par avastha of Kriya - is partaking - one who has attained the state of being at this kind of level via the teaching of Guru - he is the Self through whose own actions is dear to the Self.
