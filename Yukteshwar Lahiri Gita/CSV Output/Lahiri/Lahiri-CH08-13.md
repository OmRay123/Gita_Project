### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]14) Does not see in other directions - anything other than Atman - meaning - one who meditates while always abiding in Kutastha - always - beautifully he attains Brahman - the person who is always stuck in the par avastha of Kriya - with dharana, dhyan, samadhi - in 12 pranayams is pratyahara - in 144 pranayams is dhrarana - in 1728 pranyams is dhyan - samadhi happens if one does 20,736 pranayams - remaining unmoving in this samadhi is called “yoga.”  If one does 1728 pranayams for twelve days, then only the number-count for samadhi happens, but samadhi does not happen.  Performing all karma, always doing pranayam internally, where inside one who always has a constant pull from the Muladhar up to the head - he is said to be in “Chaitanya Samadhi”; this is everyone’s duty.  Other samadhi is like a physical event, and thus that is called “Jada Samadhi.”  But doing 1728 pranayams - that which may take place spanning from dawn to 10 p.m. at night - doing this sometimes during every season - the nature of this Earth is seen and experienced - and whatever you wish to see, you can see - if you perform pranayam with total focus of consciousness. Performing pranayam ceaselessly and exclusively in this way, when the mind becomes still by itself [naturally], Truth is known (if one practices unceasingly for six months),* but it does not happen if one makes strenuous effort to do it.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them is in the original.]
