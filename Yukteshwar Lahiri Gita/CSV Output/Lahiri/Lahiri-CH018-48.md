### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]49) Do not put attachment-filled attention on any sense objects in the present condition and in the par avastha of Kriya - always abiding in Atman, via Atman, fight with Kriya and be victorious - meaning, when desires for all sense-things stop upon abiding in the par avastha of Kriya, then no karma with the desire for their fruits remain - when there is no desire for any sense-object, which used to be acquired through desire - thus, all things are acquired, which is called “siddhi” - so that is Supreme - meaning, when - beyond all - Brahman Is - the way that He is the Non-doer, yet the Doer - in the same way, without desire, all desires are fulfilled (without having desire)* - this is what is called “siddhi” and “sannyasi” - meaning, whatsoever is desired in the present condition - one does not do with non-dutiful work - this type of Still Intelligence happens in the par avastha of Kriya.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
