### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]12) Remaining still in the par avastha of Kriya - being without the fruits of actions - neither am I anything, nor is anything mine - remaining in this type of consciousness, one attains an extraordinary type of Tranquility.  Whoever is not stuck in Brahman and performs karma with the craving for results - he becomes suffocated in bondage.
