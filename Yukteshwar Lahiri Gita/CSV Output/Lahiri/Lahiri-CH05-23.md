[Commentary:]24) One who in his heart has attained stillness through always performing Kriya, and in whom there is a kind of Light [Jyoti] - One which is neither darkness nor light - where all manifestations are revealed (Yonimudra)* - this type of yogi, abiding in Brahman, attains Nirvana, meaning the Everlasting - continuously abiding in Brahman, mind becomes stilled in Brahman Itself.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
