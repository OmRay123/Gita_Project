### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]23) There is no possibility of cutting Kutastha with a weapon, because the Void that emerges from That - nothing is cut by flailing a sword at that - in that way, vayu becomes still in the body - Kutastha - how can He be cut? That Kutastha cannot be burned by fire, cannot be wetted and soiled by water, cannot be dried by air; this is clear - the realization of this can come about by taking initiation in Kriya! (It can be known by the Grace of Guru.)
