### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]3) No phenomena can attain This - This neither has beginning nor end - because, “sarvam brahmamayam jagat” [all creation is filled with Brahman, or, all is Brahman] - [the body] is not in a completely permanent state - it is gradually going.  Mounted firmly on the head, which is the root of this tree-like body - meaning, not going because of being bound by some cause, yet continuing on with Kriya with faith in the teaching of Guru and without desire - the very powerful weapon which is coming into being, without desire, cutting into the root with that weapon - meaning, performing Kriya, which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru.
