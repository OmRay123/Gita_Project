[Commentary:]4) (3) “Adhibhuta” - keeping mind with the five elements in the Formless Kutastha, an intoxicating experience happens - meaning - remains Still in That Itself - after that, the Supreme Person is seen - He is also Formless like the sky - keeping mind stilled in Him is called “adhidaiva” - the One Who has put on the dress of this body of skin and such - pervading all of this world and all of the Cosmos - Brahmasutra - which is known through the transmission by Guru - He is the One Who is performing all karma - keeping mind in Him while engaged in all action and performing karma in this way is called “adhiyajna” (4).
