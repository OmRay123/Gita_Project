### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]11) Having taken up this body, one cannot be completely without performing karma [action] - doing all karma [work], being without the desire for results - one who does all karma like this - it is he who is called “tyagi” - with Still mind - other people who do not renounce with Still mind, and are fixed in restless character and influencing as such, again take up [the previously renounced things].
