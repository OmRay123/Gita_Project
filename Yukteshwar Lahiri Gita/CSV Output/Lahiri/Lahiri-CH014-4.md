### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]5) Sattva, rajah, tamah, the forms of ida, pingala, sushumna - mounted on the machine, they, with the five elements, mind, intellect and ego, looking with attachment-filled attention in directions other than Atman [or] Brahman, have [seemingly] bound the embodied - the Indestructible Atman, Kutastha Brahman!!  It is upon the liberation from that bondage that He is the Pure Free Buddha Being - the Form of Stillness after Kriya - the drum-stick will fall with a bang.
