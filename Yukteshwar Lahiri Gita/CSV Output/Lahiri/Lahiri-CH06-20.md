### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]21) Where there is no end to happiness - that happiness which cannot be grasped by the intellect - and neither by the senses - remaining in the par avastha of Kriya - this Substance is This - !!! It cannot be known by saying this - however, vayu [vital air] remains still - yet is functioning in the five elements - meaning, Muladhar, Svadhisthana, Manipura, Anahata, Vishuddhakhya - because if that were not so, then one would die.
