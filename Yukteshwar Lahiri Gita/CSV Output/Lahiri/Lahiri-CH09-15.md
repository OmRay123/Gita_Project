### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]16) (Aham krtu and aham yajna)* verily, I am the doer - the doer of yajna - to do yajna - the act of yajna is also verily Me - I am also the par avastha of Kriya - I am medicine also, because in that there is Brahman - there is no other medicine besides abiding in Brahman.  I am mantra - meaning, it is when oneself remains in the Self that the mind finds life - that possibility comes through transmission via Guru.  The ghee for oblation is Me - I am fire - It is to Me that oblation is done.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
