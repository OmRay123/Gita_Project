### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]12) Neither is there death for you, nor is there death for me - meaning that Kutastha is as He is, because He is Eternal. Matter and Nature are also Him, and He is that Brahman Being; He also has no birth or death. Therefore, all these royalty (senses and such)* that you see - they are also Brahman and without birth and death. What you are seeing is not what it is - this is only bubbles forming in water. Water is like Brahman; the bubble also exists from that water as a mutation caused by a quality called air. In this way know all beings - nothing is happening - beyond this all things are Brahman.[*Translator’s note: The parentheses and the translated text within them are in the original.]
