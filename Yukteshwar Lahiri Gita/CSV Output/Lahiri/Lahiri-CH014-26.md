### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]27) When, from the continuous performance of Kriya, there is True Stillness in that Brahman, then one attains Immortality, and Nectar falls - meaning, one becomes the One Brahman - then of course, One is the Immortal Indestructible - because, when all becomes Brahman, that which will be destroyed is also Brahman; if it [all] is One Substance without end, how can there be destruction?  If one always stays in that state - meaning, resides in that state in all parts of the day and night - he also becomes Brahman - this is what is known as “dharma” - performing Kriya without the desire for results is called “dharma,” which is transmitted via the teachings of Guru - residing where, there is one Happiness - meaning, one eternally resides in that One State of Supreme Bliss; which is experienced in the par avastha of Kriya by all those who perform Kriya, more or less - and it is for this Happiness that everyone is slaving for others, and murdering while “mahasaya, mahasaya” [respected sir] is said!!  But that rare Mahasaya - about whom Ashtavakra has spoken - meaning, the one who is always, constantly and totally lodged in Kutastha by Divine perception and with the Power of Self, and who does not see anything other than That Substance - it is he who is “Mahat” [great] or “Mahasaya” - that is who is a great person - whatever is given, there is happiness for a little while after having that; but the Happiness which has no end - no one at all wishes to attain that kind of Happiness - all people of all kinds must desire this Happiness!!!ity srimadbhagavadgitasupanishatsu brahmavidyayam yogashastre srikrishnarjunasamvade gunatrayavibhagayogonama chaturdashohdhyayahThus ends the Fourteenth Chapter.
