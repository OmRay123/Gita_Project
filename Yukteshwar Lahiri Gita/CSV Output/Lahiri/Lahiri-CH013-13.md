### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]14) The qualities of all senses manifested in form - like: sight in the eyes, sound in the ears, ability to smell in the nose, taste in the tongue, feeling in the touch - He is in all these qualities [functions] - this itself is His Form - the experience of this is known by yogis through practice, one by one, through the teachings of Guru.  That, through which if one sees, hears, smells, eats, touches is devoid [of those qualities] - completely - meaning, one does not put attachment-filled attention on anything at all - He is maintaining and nurturing all - meaning, He is eating His own food.  It is He Who is feeding, and He Who is eating as well - devoid of attachment-filled qualities - meaning, that happens when breath is still, beyond the three gunas; and He is the enjoyer of all gunas.
