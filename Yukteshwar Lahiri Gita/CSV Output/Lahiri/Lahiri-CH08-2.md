### Commentary

[Commentary:]3) It is being revealed via Kutastha - Kutastha is the Formless ParaBrahman (1) -  performance of Kriya is called “adhyatma” (2), meaning (adhi = intellect [mind]) keeping intellect [mind] stilled in Atman, going beyond the three gunas after the performance of Kriya and knowing the Wondrous Self free from the imprisonment of ida, pingala, sushumna - this is what is known as “adhyatma.”
