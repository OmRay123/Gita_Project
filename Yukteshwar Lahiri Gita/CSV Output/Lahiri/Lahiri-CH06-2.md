### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]3) One who, after continuously performing Kriya, becomes still in the par avastha of Kriya and automatically [spontaneously, by itself] has no desire to speak - he is called “muni.”  But one who at the beginning of Kriya [thinks] “something good will happen” - [and] does not perform karma without this kind of mind - one who does it with the wish of that karma coming out well - he is called “arurukshu.” When performing karma in this way - whatever is to happen, let it happen - some fruits are attained, meaning when mind is blissful - then he continues to perform karma without desire - he is called “yogarudha.”
