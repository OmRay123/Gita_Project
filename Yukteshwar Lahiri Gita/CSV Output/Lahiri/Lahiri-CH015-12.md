### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]13) By the rays of this world’s moon, entering as the essence-fluid in all plant life, I am nourishing in the form of medicine - which - the yogis, with will and strength, keep their own life-force stilled in the head and enter the guna of a substance - the yogi who stays in this state - his Kriya does not happen very well, because Brahman is infinite - the qualities of Brahman are also infinite - it is not enough that there is an infinity - the infinity is again itself infinite; going there, there is no way of finding His end - he himself [the yogi] forgot himself.
