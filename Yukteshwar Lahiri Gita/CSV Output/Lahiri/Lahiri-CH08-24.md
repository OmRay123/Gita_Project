### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]25) When the yogi is disengaged from Kriya - meaning, attention filled with attachment is in other things, not meditating upon Atman, deluded as if in a dark night, like a small amount of moonlight - covered in the pleasures of samsara - the pleasure that does not remain forever - because the moon does not remain in the same state, and neither is its light like the sun - like that, the world contracts and expands - in this state - meaning staying in momentary pleasure - to the Winter Solstice - meaning, with effort, do not die in the house of death - meaning, they do not go there. Performing Kriya a little bit at a time for six months - and ordinarily, sadhus almost always in the southern direction - when the sun remains for six months - they do not die then. And when the sun is in the northern direction, it is in that that they die. At first, performing Kriya for six months, they see the moon - after that, they see Kutastha in Yonimudra - then again after another six months - with intense Light - they die then. That, after many days - meaning - they can see after almost one year of work - then, with the utterance, in Yonimudra - Omkar Kriya - which has been expounded upon in sloka 12.
