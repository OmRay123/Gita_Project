### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]29) I am in all phenomena, meaning all (jivas)* phenomena - the Self of all phenomena is seen in this Self (jiva’s),** by performing dharana, dhyan, samadhi and abiding in the par avastha of Kriya.  Then, “sarvam brahmamayam jagat,” - thus all is seen as the same.[*, ** Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within are in the original.]
