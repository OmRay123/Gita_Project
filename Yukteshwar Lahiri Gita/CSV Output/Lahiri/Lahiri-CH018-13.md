### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]14) First, one fixes an action in the mind - thinking that he is himself the doer, he fixes it [in mind] - upon fixing it [in mind], he lets it begin - upon beginning, he makes many kinds of efforts - so what if he does so - whatever is to happen, happens because of subtle forces - therefore: intellect, having ego, many kinds of efforts and the subtle forces - these are the causes of every karma [action which must be fulfilled].  But the cause of all karma is mind itself; if one just stills that mind via Kriya, then there is no karma with the desire for results at all.
