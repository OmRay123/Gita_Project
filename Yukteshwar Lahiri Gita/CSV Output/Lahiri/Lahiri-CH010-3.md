### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]4) Always keeping mind stilled in Brahman and experiencing via that is called “jnana” - if that happens, one is not deluded into other things - therefore, if one is not deluded, there is forgiveness - meaning, forgiveness comes from that by itself - one stays in Brahman for the necessity of doing so - afterwards, all sensory issues are extinguished and ceased, as well as pleasure and sorrow, occurrence and non-occurrence, fear and fearlessness.
