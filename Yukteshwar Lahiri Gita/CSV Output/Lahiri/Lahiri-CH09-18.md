### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]19) [Not] by desire - meaning not doing it continuously in the mind, creation happens - when persons come upon this kind of ability - then the sight is upon Immortality.  That is Itself Brahman!!! Dying is My form - because there is no liberation unless there is dying while being alive.  I am the good, and I am the bad as well.
