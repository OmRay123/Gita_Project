### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]4) The fire of the body is saying: What kind of perpetual fear - that rises by itself - engaging in which men can be killed - and what father and grandfather have always done - how can I be without that - those whom I have honored at all times - but You are the True destroyer of the side of the enemies comprised of the senses and such.
