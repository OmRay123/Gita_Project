### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]20) After this, remaining in the par avastha of Kriya - there is no “vyakta” [speakable or knowable] or “avyakta” [unspeakable or unknowable] - he - abiding always in Brahman, in the end merges in the Universal Brahman - one in whose phenomenal being this Knowledge has happened - he - though destructible, has no destruction - “indestructible”: does not at all have any destruction - meaning: remains as the Form of Brahman, like a particle in-between.  In that Form, whatever he wishes is fulfilled even before it is wished, or he can do so.  This is self-evident and perceivable - “the one who does, sees; whoever is seeing is seeing” - saying such, no one will believe it - do it and see!!!
