### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]25) Ascend upwards gradually and being in stillness, see all forms - dharana - what happens spontaneously in the par avastha of Kriya - that Itself will expand. Being completely still in Atman in the par avastha of Kriya, think of nothing else in the mind - by itself, thought does not happen.
