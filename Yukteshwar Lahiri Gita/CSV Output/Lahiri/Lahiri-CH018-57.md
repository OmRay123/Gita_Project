### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]58) Keeping consciousness always on Me - meaning performing Kriya, which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru - among all enemies, the ones that fall into the fort - the mind will be freed from them.  If [one says], “I am a powerful person,” with ego, and “if you don’t listen to me, then you’ll die” - meaning, “you will be thrown out of your situation” - [then] one will have to take birth again - listen to My words; listen to the mad drunkard’s words.
