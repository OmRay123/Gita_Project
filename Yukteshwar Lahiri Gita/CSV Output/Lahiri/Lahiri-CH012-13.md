### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]14) Always - content at heart - spontaneously by itself in the abidance in the par avastha of Kriya - because oneself is lodged completely and securely - whoever has stilled his mind after Kriya and has surrendered it to Me - meaning, does not put attachment-filled attention on other things - that state, which happens by itself - where he stills and surrenders the intellect - which also happens by itself - one whose faith in the teachings of Guru has become like this - he is dear to Me - meaning, besides this, he absolutely knows nothing else at all.
