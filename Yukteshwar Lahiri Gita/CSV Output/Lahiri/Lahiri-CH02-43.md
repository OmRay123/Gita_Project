### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]44) Those for whom, because of desire for opulent sense-enjoyments, there is no conscious abiding in Brahman - the one who is engaged in this kind of endeavor - how can his self abide in Atman and perform pranayam twenty thousand seven hundred thirty six times? This does not come to their minds at all.
