### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]23) This spiritual Knowledge is what is known as knowledge - Kriya is itself Knowledge - with this, yoga in its full form happens while [one is] in numerous types of sorrowful situations, meaning - there is attainment.  Staying completely and properly stuck in this is what is called yoga.  Thus, having faith in the words of Guru, one should confidently perform Kriya, without attachment to other directions.
