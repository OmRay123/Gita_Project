### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]32) In the way that space moves in subtle form throughout all in the immense Universe - meaning, stillness - its function is stillness and movement both!!  In the path of the subtle is Stillness, in the path of the physical is movement!!!  But subtleness is functioning as non-enmeshed [nirlipta].  In that way, the microcosm, in atomic form, is in all bodies - Brahman is pervading but in Stillness.  In that way, the Self in the body - which is the microcosmic Brahman - is residing in all places.  Movement is happening, yet there is Stillness!!  As soon as there is Stillness there is Nirlipta Brahman - That Stillness is the par avastha of Kriya - one who does not have It is residing in the world - meaning, from the time of birth onward, is only living in movement.  The way to stop the movement of the Universe is just this Kriya - which is transmitted via Guru and can be done with ease.  Only having a bit of priority to keeping attention in this direction [is needed] and “one will be pulled along by the current only”* - grab hold of a pillar [post] which is within you.[*Translator’s note:  The quotation marks and text within them is in the original.]
