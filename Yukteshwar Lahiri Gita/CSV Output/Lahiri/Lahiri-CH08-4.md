### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]5) At the time of death, whosoever leaves the body while surrendered in Kutastha - because he has kept his mind in Me - it is My Essence - meaning, it is in Me that he is Still and is liberated - there is no questioning this - the Oneness/Dissolution that Kriyanvita persons are experiencing every day.
