### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]3) Like a eunuch, neither on this side nor on that side, meaning not even being only covered in samsara, because from time to time even extreme evil-doers think about God, and neither being in Atman all the time - not being like that also, because from time to time the attention goes out to worldly attachment - for you this is not appropriate action - those who are of low character and those who have no desire to anything good - they are the ones who act in this way - therefore renounce this - renouncing it, remain above - when that happens, that is when you will always abide in Kutastha.Arjuna said:
