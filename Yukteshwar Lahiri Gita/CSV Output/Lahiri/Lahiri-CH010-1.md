### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]2) All those persons who are performing Kriya do not know Me - the great sages - Marichi - Atri - Angirasa - Pulasta - Pulaha - Krtu - Pracheta - Vashishta - Bhrigu - Narad; these ten great sages - they do not know Me - all of the great sages are worshippers of Brahman - thus, I am before all [adi*] - all the gods that exist are all worshippers of Brahman - thus, I am before all.[*Translator’s note:  The spiritual meaning of the word “adi” is complex to translate.  In this context, its meaning is a combination of:  before, the beginning, the Original, the Primal, beyond everything.  The translator has chosen to use the English word “before” for the sake of simplicity and because it is the most open expression of the compound meaning.]
