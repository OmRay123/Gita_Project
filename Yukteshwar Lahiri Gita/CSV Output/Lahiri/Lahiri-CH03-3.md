### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]4) First:  the restfulness without performing Kriya, meaning that without Kriya, one cannot abide in the Supreme Person, and if that does not happen, then desires for superfluous things also do not end - without the ending of desire, there is no fulfillment [completion/realization] of everything, meaning that it is when desire ends that all is fulfilled [perfected]. From such realization, mind becomes contented - it is when desire ends that this mind is contented.
