### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]23) OM tatsat - the three abodes of Brahman: (1) Omkar - the form of this body; (2) tat - Kutastha; (3)* sat - Brahman - meaning, one who will abide in Brahman; he will first perform Kriya in the body, which is called “yajna.”  Charity [offering] - offering mind after performing Kriya - meaning Stillness - residing in TapoBrahman.  It is upon doing Kriya that one is “brahmin” - it is when Stillness happens upon the performance of Kriya that one is able to know; that knowing is called “Veda” - merging oneself in Brahman is called “yajna” - meaning, the Stillness after Kriya.[*Translator’s note:  All of the parentheses -( )- and the numbers -1, 2, 3- within them are in the original.  The bracketed - [ ] - comment is the translator’s, used for the purposes of clarification.]
