### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]33) In the par avastha of Kriya, when dharana happens automatically, and mind and prana-vayu and the awareness of the ten organs [of perception and action] are all stopped - Still with dharana, dhyan, samadhi - then, one will remain in OneSelf; there will be no attachment-filled attention in other directions then - this type of dharana - it is this that is called “sattvic dharana.”
