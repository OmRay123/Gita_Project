### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]16) That act, which mind takes up without the desire for results - that is this Kriya, which is acquired through the teachings of Guru - this virtuous work of Truth, this sattvic karma [action] - its pure fruit is Brahman, which happens in the par avastha of Kriya.  The fruit of rajoguna - meaning, doing action with the desire for results itself causes sorrow - keeping attachment-filled attention elsewhere and residing in tamoguna - who is this “I” - that thing one cannot know - thus, he is unconscious - the result of tamoguna - like when some gentleman goes to a house of ill-repute and he himself forgets who he is.
