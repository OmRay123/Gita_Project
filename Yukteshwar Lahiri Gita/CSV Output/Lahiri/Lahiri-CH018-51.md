### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]52) Always resides by oneself in the Self, eats little, keeps control of speech, thinks of oneself as small in a body, does not go about with arrogance, without taking mind in other directions and thinking oneself as small, abides in the Self - meaning, performs Kriya - which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru - does 1,728 pranayams every day, and does 21,736 pranayams from time to time - meaning, does pranayam day and night and always - meaning, always resides in this only - which happens automatically from continuously doing Kriya - when abiding in the Self at all times, having this kind of practice, then no desire in directions other than Brahman happens in any way - this is what is known as “vairagya” [non-attachment]; one who has this is the one who is “vairagi.”
