### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]12) The preliminary state of the condition in which one’s heart goes in the direction of one’s desire-filled, thoroughly attachment-filled attention on some sense-object is called “lobha” [greed].  “Pravritti” - to completely keep mind on that thing constantly and always, becoming like that thing is called “pravritti” [engagement]; thoroughly eyeing something with attachment and suddenly taking action for it is called “arambha” [starting]; performing action with the craving for its fruits is called “karma.”  Not stopping desire in all ways - meaning, “I lost at this door; I’ll go to another door” - meaning, the lowest court of justice, small court of justice, superior court of justice etc. - these are all acts of rajoguna, the acts from the expansion of rajoguna.
