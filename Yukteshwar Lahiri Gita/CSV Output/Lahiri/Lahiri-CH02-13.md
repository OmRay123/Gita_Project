[Commentary:]14) The quintelemental body, meaning, earth, water, fire, air, ether, Muladhar, Svadhishthan, Manipur, Anahata, Vishuddhakhya, the “A” , the “U”, the “M”, Nada, Bindu. Touch, meaning experiencing these by vayu - and being in existence and dissolution, beyond these is Kutastha Brahman - where the Ajna Chakra is - when vayu is stilled - boundless - sound stopped - Bindu, Nada, quarter-moon-zodiac-time-all aspects of things, future and the Beyond is known - it is He about Whom the scriptures such as the Vedas speak. There is a kind of Bliss there [Supreme Bliss] which is called Paramananda, immersing in which there is profound intoxication - thus, when one does not contact the limited [sense-world etc.], one is without pleasure and pain; when one contacts the limited, one is with pleasure and pain. It is by this contact one experiences; observe this (titikshu = look).
