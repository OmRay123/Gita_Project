[Commentary:]20) This dharma - meaning Kriya without desire - it is in this that you will receive Immortal Substance - the one who performs Kriya in this way and resides above - abiding in Brahman - only Atman Itself is beyond everything - knowing this very thing - meaning having been initiated in Kriya via the teaching of Guru, and doing it [practicing] with faith - the one who comes to know this Supreme Substance automatically by himself, resides in secure Tranquility in the Bliss of Brahman.  Thus, the one who wishes to attain the Knowledge of Brahman - he should perform this Kriya.ity srimadbhagavadgitasupanishatsu brahmavidyayam yogashastre srikrishnarjunasamvade bhaktiyogonama dvadashohdhyayahThus ends the Twelfth Chapter.
