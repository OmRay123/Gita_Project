### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]6) That is an incredibly wondrous place - which actually many Kriyanvita persons are seeing, which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru - but upon hearing, people will mockingly laugh at that, because of not knowing - the sun’s rays are not there - the moon’s beams are not there - the fire’s flame is not there - going where, one does not return back again - That is what My Supreme Abode is - meaning, the par avastha of Kriya.
