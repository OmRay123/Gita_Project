### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]20) He has no birth because he is Eternal, all-pervading - where is there any place to be born - where is death for Eternal Substance? All is Brahman!! Then how can one thing be changed [mutated or affected] by another thing? This can never happen - that which you are seeing as happening - that is just a image-form which is false - that will also dissolve into Brahman. Being and not being for that are the same; when being and not being are the same, and even has not been, then how can it be? Nothing has happened from anything. Because the Unborn/Self-Born Brahman is the Eternal Primordial Person - He Himself does not slay - because by what shall He slay? That by which He will slay - in that is also Brahman - the One He will slay - He is also Brahman - therefore, how will Brahman kill Brahman? This body - its destruction is continuously happening, but how can the destroyable destroy the Indestructible?
