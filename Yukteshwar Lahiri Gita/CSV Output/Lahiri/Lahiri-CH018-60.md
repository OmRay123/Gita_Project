### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]61) The Lord is established in the heart - in the par avastha of Kriya - in absolutely all phenomena, in the mobile and immobile - in the Form of Brahman; to all phenomena via the machines of ida, pingala and sushumna - meaning those that have happened and those that will happen, covered in that - “arudha” - meaning, [mounted] on other things which are false, thinking them to be true - traveling - “maya” - meaning, attachment-filled attention is being given.
