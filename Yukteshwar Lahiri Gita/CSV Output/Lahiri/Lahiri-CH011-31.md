### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]32) It is being experienced via Kutastha - I am become Time; the time engaged in the destruction of people; breath is moving 21,600 times during the day and night; by extending the prana-vayu, yogis keep that time stilled from the small samadhi to the Great Samadhi.  Then the Eternal and Still Form of Brahman becomes the Death of Time - engaged in this one act - no one will survive except you - all of the warriors that are there.
