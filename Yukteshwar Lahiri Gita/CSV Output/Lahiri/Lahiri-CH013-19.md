### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]20) The five elements [and] mind, intellect and ego - residing in this, one can see the cause behind duty-bound karma.  Performing karma upon the arising of such cause, the doer feels his sense of ego etc. and becomes attached to all sensory matters - meaning, becomes engaged in the performing of action with the desire for results.  Maheshvara is the One Who is Tranquilly residing in this body in the Form of Kutastha - Who can be seen clearly and perfectly after Kutastha, upon devotedly performing Kriya - He is devoid of pleasure and sorrow - not abiding in Him - meaning, when oneself does not abide in the Self - upon acquiring by putting attachment-filled attention elsewhere, one thinks of himself as being happy.  There is sorrow in not having, but the root phenomenal cause of these (of pleasure and sorrow)* is that Supreme Person Himself.  Because if He is not there, then who experiences all of these things?  Therefore, the cause of the experiencing of pleasure and sorrow is He.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them is in the original.]
