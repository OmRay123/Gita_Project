### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]20) All that exists in earth and heaven and the heart within are thoroughly imbued with Light (abiding)* - oh, it’s happening - all directions are Light upon Light - seeing this intense Form of Yours - in the three worlds, there is hurt in my mind - meaning, heaven, earth, the netherworld - the inattentiveness of this body itself - no awareness of this remains in the end - it is experienced in the end state after Kriya.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
