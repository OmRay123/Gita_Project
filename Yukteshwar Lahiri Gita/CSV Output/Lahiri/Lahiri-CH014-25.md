[Commentary:]26) “Mamcha” - to Me - meaning, one who performs Kriya - not putting attachment-filled attention in other directions (mind)* - meaning, being “Sati” - keeping singular focus towards Kutastha, abiding in Atman, not looking with attachment on other things - one who performs Kriya with dharana, dhyan, samadhi and faith in the teachings of Guru - which is transmitted via the teachings of Guru - abiding in that par avastha of Kriya, going beyond the three gunas, being Still in Equipoise at all times of the day and night, one knows My Essence - meaning, “I have become the One Brahman” or “I am going to [become]” - this is realized - OM.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
