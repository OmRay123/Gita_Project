### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]14 - 15) The existence of all phenomena has been born of Brahman.  Food is appearing because of rain; clouds appear because of yajna; yajna is happening because of karma [work] - thus Brahman is in everything.  Brahman is from the Unmanifest; thus Brahman is in yajna itself (in all karma [work]).*[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them is in the original, except for the bracketed word, which is there for clarification.]
