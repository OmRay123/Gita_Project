### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]2) It is being revealed via Kutastha: By looking at things everywhere else and being attached to that, this tremendous sin that has come upon you - this is not the work of those who abide in Brahman, and there is no happiness in this [attachment to senses etc.] either. Not abiding in Kutastha will cause whatever malevolent things to happen.
