### Commentary 
 --- 
15) Those who are “dushkrita” [wrongdoers] meaning - not “sukrita” [doers of the right thing]  = “su” = “Brahman” = “Atman” = those who do not abide in That - they are ignorant.  They do not truly prostrate at My Feet, meaning Soul - (the Soul is Itself the [Lord’s] Feet, because the Soul goes from this body to another body - feet also go from one place to another)* - meaning they do not perform Kriya.  They are human of course, but “adham” [base person].  The meaning of the word “adham” - “a” = jeweled - Kutastha; “adhah” - below.  Because they remain below Kutastha and do not ascend above, they are “adham.”  Looking elsewhere with attachment, they lose their attention from Atman.  And always focusing attention on Atman = this “sura’s” [demigods] - devata’s - duty -  “a” = the opposite of that - meaning remains engaged in works of “asuras” [demons].**[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.][**Translator’s note:  The common definitions of  “dushkrita” - wrongdoers, “sukrita” - right-doers, “adham” - base person, “sura” - demigod, and “asura” - demon, are given in brackets only to contrast the common meanings to the deeper spiritual meanings conveyed by His Supreme Holiness Yogiraj Sri Sri Shyamacharan Lahiri Mahasaya.  It is hoped that providing these definitions will help the non-Bengali reader to better grasp what was originally written in Bengali in the commentary to this sloka.  This contrast of meanings - common and spiritual - is very evident in the original and thus the effort was made to make it as evident as possible in this English version, without changing the wording of the original.]
