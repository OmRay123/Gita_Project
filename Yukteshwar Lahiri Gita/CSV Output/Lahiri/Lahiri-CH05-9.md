### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]10) Meditating upon Brahman, I perform all karma [actions] without desiring results; thus, I am not bound by any sins - as the essence of Brahman is extremely subtle, likened to the essence of the lotus leaf, know this.  And the essence of water is likened to worldly existence. Thus, just as water floats on top of the lotus leaf*, in the same way, all karma floats around on top of the essence of Brahman - even while doing all worldly karma is not bound.[*Translator’s note:  Normally, the analogy given is one of the lotus (flower or leaf) floating on top of the water, but in this case, Yogiraj’s comments are about water on top of the leaf. There is a lesser known analogy of the lotus leaf and water, and that is one of water -sometimes dewdrops - ON the lotus leaf. The dewdrop or water being neither one with nor separate from the lotus leaf.]
