### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]15) When one goes and becomes thoroughly merged in rajoguna, then one performs actions with the craving for results - and when one becomes thoroughly merged in tamoguna, then one attains a state which is like that of an ignorant person - like an idiot!!!!  Awakened idiot (Brahman)* - is wanton in Brahman.  That is - he knows everything, yet he does not know.  Unconscious idiot (Brahman)** - is wanton with prostitutes - “does not know anything at all, yet says I know everything.”***[* and ** Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.] [***Translator’s note:  The quotation marks [in the positions seen] and the text within them are in the original.]
