[Commentary:]28) Seeing and hearing all - totally performing Kriya - seeing all people via Kriya in Kutastha and always abiding there - the result that comes about from this - transcending all of these - in Yonimudra seeing all sadhus in Kutastha sitting in front - there is fruition. Later, continuing to perform Kriya, from time to time performing pranayam twenty thousand seven hundred thirty six (20,736)* times in one sitting - gradually continuing to practice this, one attains “ekasana” in this way - meaning remains always in the state that is after Kriya - after which there is no abode - meaning the Supreme Abode - Brahman. One remains merged in That - meaning, attainment of Brahman happens - the One Who is the Primal Source of All.[*Translator’s Note: The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]ity srimadbhagavadgitasupanishatsu brahmavidyayam yogashastre srikrishnarjunasamvade aksharabrahmayogonama ashtamohdhyayahThus ends the Eighth Chapter.
