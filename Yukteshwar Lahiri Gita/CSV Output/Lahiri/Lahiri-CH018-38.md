### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]39) Right at the beginning, the mind is tied up; for the sake of little momentary pleasure, one is deluded - it is felt first in that sleep - like when someone interrupts sleep, then it is felt.  It is the same in laziness.  And in passion also, or being infatuated with some sense object and giving attention, filled with attachment - this is called “tamasic happiness” - meaning, cannot see anything at all.
