### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]25) I am not revealed to everyone; because everyone has their attention filled with attachment on other things - they remain covered by that - for this reason, they are ignorant, and therefore, not residing in Atman, do not know me.  Neither do I have birth, nor do I have an end - that is this par avastha of Kriya - he will not know anything about when it comes and when it goes.
