### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]37) In the beginning, the way that there is inflammatory pain from poison, in that way, the advice of those of Truth, or listening about Kriya - one becomes enveloped by ego and almost never does the mind give in to caring about that - but if one once lowers one’s head, has faith in Guru’s teaching, and becomes engaged in the practice of Kriya - “nectar, nectar” - everyone has certainly heard, but no one has seen it, nor has anyone experienced it - after Kriya, upon having received initiation with the teaching of Guru, that can be experienced - upon receiving that infinite happiness, one attains the Immortal - which, by abiding in sushumna - that Kriya happens - for this reason, that is called “sattvic happiness.”  One simply stills mind in Atman via Kriya - by the Grace of Atman Itself, one attains Supreme Bliss.
