### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]10) The yogi - remaining in the par avastha of Kriya - always and continuously performs Kriya - the mystery of Atman - meaning secret - every form - [all of] which are seen in the state of Vijnana - where there is no night or day - remaining in that itself - devoid of expectation of any thing of the world - even while in the midst of everyone, is alone - one’s self does not look elsewhere - does not go to any house other than Atman.
