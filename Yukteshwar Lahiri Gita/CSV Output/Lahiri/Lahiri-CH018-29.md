### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]30) One should fully stay in this act - meaning Kriya; one should not stay without doing Kriya - Kriya is what is to be done [karya] - not doing it is being useless [akarya]; if Kriya is not done, there is fear; if Kriya is done, there is no fear - if Kriya is not done, there is bondage; if Kriya is done, there is liberation - this type of buddhi - this happens from doing Kriya - meaning, if one remains in sushumna, buddhi is sattvic.
