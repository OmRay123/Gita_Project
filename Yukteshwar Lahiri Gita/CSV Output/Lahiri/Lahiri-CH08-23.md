### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]24) Like blazing fire all around, all directions will be aflame - in that, lightning will manifest - in that, there will light like daylight - white - a manifestation as if millions of suns and millions of moons have risen together - this will manifest in front of one after continuous practice of Kriya, day and night, for six months - those who reside in that and are in samadhi - these esteemed persons who are knowers of Brahman, like Bhisma and such - leaving the body.
