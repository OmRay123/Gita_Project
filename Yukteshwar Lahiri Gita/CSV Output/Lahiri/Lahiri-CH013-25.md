### Translation 
 --- 
25) Listening to all this - meaning, listening about appropriate action - they take some particular thing which they steady in the mind and sit; they too, not having received anything else, simply listen to the Omkar Sound and stay in repose; they also cross over - meaning, the Tranquil Stillness from the performance of Kriya is experienced.

### Commentary

[Commentary:]26) All that has happened which you see - immobile and mobile - in all of these is Sat-Brahman; and He is also the manifested form of all - the field, in the Form of Prakriti; and He is also in all as the knower of the field - the form of jiva - the Supreme Person, Brahman-Being, All-pervading One - He Is.  Thus, upon seeing that One Purusha, abiding single-mindedly in that One Purusha, the One is Itself One - meaning, in Brahman is Brahman.  Then, nothing else remains to be known or acquired.
