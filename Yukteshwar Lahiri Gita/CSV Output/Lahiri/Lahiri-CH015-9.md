### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]10) Since having taken birth, [he] has only been continuously performing actions with the desire for results, and steadfastly going on and going on, is remaining [here] for a few days, and he is reaping according to the gunas predominating the particular acts - if one lets go of gunas and lives in non-guna [nirguna], It happens - but that he does not do - one has one guna only - that he cannot ever let go, like a fool - therefore, partaking in the results of actions performed with the craving for its fruits, he discerns that which is sorrow as pleasure, and that which is false - meaning, discerning it to be true because of its presence for a few days - one is actually not being able to see anything at all - yet the thing to be seen, as if covered (mack),* is in the middle of the body - upon knowing from the teaching of Guru and verily performing Kriya, one is able to see that [thing to be seen] via the knowing faculty of the divine sight of Kutastha.  Not one’s own good but other’s good - all is ruined in this detrimental concept - bound [in this], such is happening to people.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the word within them - “mack” - are in the original.  An alternate spelling could be “mac.”  “Mack” or “mac” is an obsolete British abbreviation for “mackintosh” which is a type of overcoat or water-proof raincoat commonly used in the 1800s.]
