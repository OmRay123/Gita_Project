### Commentary

[Commentary:]45) One who always keeps attention on one’s own work of the Self, gradually, that person attains perfection in all things - meaning, upon abiding in the par avastha of Kriya, there is no desire for anything; staying continuously with one’s own work, and going on fully with the practice of Kriya, desire is stopped.  I am speaking of that; listen:-46) The place from where all are becoming - meaning, that self-attention being in other directions filled with attachment - which, when not there, one is becoming Mahadeva - [then] never is there a possibility of attention falling on any thing, because there is no jiva-pleasure in a corpse; for this reason, there is nothing in him - therefore, the jivatma is itself the cause of all substances; thus, “svakarma” - meaning one’s own work - Kriya without the desire for its fruits - doing this affectionately, with devotion and in all ways is called “archana”* - in this way, having received Kriya via the teaching of Guru, human beings attain the fulfillment of all things - meaning, the thing for which there is desire, once one gets that thing, desire no longer remains - in that way, when oneself resides in the Self Itself in the par avastha of Kriya, then, the way that [all] desires are stopped if one gets all things, that is the state that happens.  Like, the satisfaction that comes from eating a mango; when someone gets that same satisfaction without eating [the mango], then why would he look at the mango - meaning, why would he try to get a mango.  All of that is experienced in the par avastha of Kriya, which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru.[*Translator’s note:  Sanskrit transliterations may sometimes write “archana” as “arcana”, but then we would have to use other phonetic symbols, which we are not using.  To avoid any misunderstanding, also please note that here we are not using the western word “arcana.”  The “archana” we are using is a Sanskrit word.]
