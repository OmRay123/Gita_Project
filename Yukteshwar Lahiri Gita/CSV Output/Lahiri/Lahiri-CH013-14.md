### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]15) The outside and inside of all phenomena, which the Kriyanvita persons are seeing - in the inanimate and animate - which is unveiled when there is the Knowledge of Brahman - thus, one can see all - inside the house and outside.  Extremely subtle; the Atom of Brahman is subtle; which is why one cannot know it very well very easily - You are both far away and within as well.
