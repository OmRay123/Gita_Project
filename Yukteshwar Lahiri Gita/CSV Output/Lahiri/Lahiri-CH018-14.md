### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]15) The reasons for all of these causes are five.  Because this body is here, mind fixes attention in other directions - that attention, upon hearing through speech - such and such thing is like this - it is quite well; one is well; let one remain well - but not thinking in that way, [instead thinking] “I will be the lord of that thing” - meaning, “that thing belongs to me” - after that, mind goes forward to get that thing - in order to go, shoes, clothes, shawl are taken, and the feet take to the road - go up to the shop - going there, [one asks] “Is there any ‘ledikeni’*?”  “Unfortunately, there is no ledikeni” - this is troublesome karma.  Instead of taking this, one can take some other thing - therefore, by body, speech and mind, whether it is proper karma or troublesome karma - these five are the reasons for all karma.[*Translator’s note:  “Ledikeni” is a type of sweet.]
