### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]34) The field and the knower of the field - meaning, the body and the embodied - are known as soon as the Knowledge-Eye Kutastha is revealed - meaning, Yonimudra - mind does not go in other directions and stays only in that Divine Sight - which is transmitted via Guru’s teaching!  The five elements - Muladhar, Svadhisthan, Manipura, Anahata, Vishuddhakhya - these five elements - the Self-linga - intercourse is done by the linga in the linga - when mind is stilled, there will be intelligence - after intelligence is Parabuddhi [Intelligence which is Beyond] - meaning, the Purusha after Prakriti - that is Itself Me-Brahman!!  It functions like - Prakriti, in the Mighty Form of Kali - mounted on top of Maheshvara is slaying everyone in Her own maya.  Mahadeva takes Her back in His very own Form.  Once taken, attention is no longer in other directions - the Self remains in the Self - that is the par avastha of Kriya, and beyond all - merging in that - this is what is known as Moksha [liberation].  This itself is the Supreme Thing, this itself is the Supreme Thing.ity srimadbhagavadgitasupanishatsu brahmavidyayam yogashastre srikrishnarjunasamvade kshetrakshetrajnavibhagayogonama trayodashohdhyayahThus ends the Thirteenth Chapter.
