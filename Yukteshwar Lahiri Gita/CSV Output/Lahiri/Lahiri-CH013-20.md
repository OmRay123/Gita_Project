### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]21) Purusha becomes Prakriti-ized in particular ways; the three gunas which are born of Prakriti - meaning, ida, pingala, sushumna - partaking in them, mounted on the machine of the three gunas, putting attachment-filled attention in other directions, He experiences [partakes] in that way.  That Prakriti’s qualities are what is everything - whoever is performing whatever kinds of actions with the desire for results, they are experiencing [partaking] through [birth in] good and bad yonis.
