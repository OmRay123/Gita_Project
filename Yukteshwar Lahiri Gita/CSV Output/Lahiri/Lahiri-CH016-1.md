### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]2) If there is no envy/aggression, desire does not remain - if one does not reside in the par avastha of Kriya, desire is not destroyed - all of the things that you are seeing - absolutely all are false, because you are seeing verily everything; in the par avastha of Kriya, nothing at all can be seen - therefore, Truth is that Brahman; in the par avastha of Kriya, this type of feeling: I exist - is not felt; when oneself is not, then the other is also not; in what way can anger remain and for whom?  In the par avastha of Kriya, no desire for sense objects remain; therefore if there is no desire itself, then what of its fruits?  In the par avastha of Kriya - neither am I anything, nor is anything mine - I myself am not; with whom will I do malice - I will be immersed in joy, and I will let others be immersed in joy - this is what is called mercy.  There is no other thing besides Brahman - in what shall I have greed - trumped above the words of everyone - wisdom words soaked and heavy - meaning words and wisdom of value which should be applied - does not come out of the mouth of anyone at all, that which happens in the par avastha of Kriya - then, no restlessness remains.
