### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]47) If from time to time mind goes in other directions while performing Kriya, that is also all right, but keeping attention completely in another thing (another besides Atman)* with expectations and the desire for results - in that there is the fear of death, because if there is no death, who will enjoy that fruit.  If, upon continuously doing Kriya, the Immortal Substance - meaning the Stillness after Kriya in all parts of the day and night - does not happen and death itself comes, that is also good - but putting attention in other directions besides Atman with the desire for results - there will certainly be death, but in order to fulfill the enjoyment of the results, the fear of birth and death remains - meaning, just doing Kriya for a short while causes desire to stop - gradually, that is being experienced by everyone - meaning, Kriyanvita persons - it is unnecessary to write - abiding in the par avastha of Kriya with dhyan, dharana, samadhi - attachment-filled attention does not go in other directions; thus, no sin is incurred either.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
