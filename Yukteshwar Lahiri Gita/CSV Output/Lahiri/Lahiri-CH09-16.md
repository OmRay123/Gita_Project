### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]17) I am the Grandfather Brahman - the world’s - meaning, all active things - all of those have emerged from Me and I am sustaining them, and I am everyone’s Grandpa, [the knowledge of] which is transmitted via Guru - I am that which is to be known - on the earth there is nothing comparable that is as pure as Me - It is with Me that Omkar is the form of this body.  Rik, Sama, Yaju - the three becoming together make Atharva. These four directions are My Form.
