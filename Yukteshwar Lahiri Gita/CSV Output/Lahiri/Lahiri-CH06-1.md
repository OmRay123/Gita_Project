### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]2) The one who is called “sannyasi” is also the one who is called “yogi.”  The sannyasi is without desire for the meaningless in the present, and the yogi is devoid of desire for the future as well.  The sannyasi who cannot stop desires for the future - he cannot ever be a yogi.
