### Commentary

[Commentary:]11) Enjoined with dhyan, dharana, samadhi - meaning, remaining lodged - oneself abiding in one’s Heart (that which people do not do; because of which sorrow manifests above*),** [one] can see via Divine Sight upon performing the Kriya of Atman (which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru)*** and attaining the state of Stillness - meaning remaining lodged in the par avastha of Kriya; he is simply pulling the mind and bringing it into Atman - meaning, making beginning efforts; he cannot see Atman - because one has not remained lodged in the Awakened Consciousness of Kutastha Brahman - this is what is known as “akritatma” - meaning, continuing to do it for a while, it will happen.[*Translator’s note:  The word “above” in the parenthetical refers to the surface condition of a being.][**and ***Translator’s note:  The parentheses - ( ) - and the text within them are in the original.  The bracketed - [ ] - term is the translator’s, used for the purposes of clarification.]
