### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]23) One who knows this Supreme Person in this way - meaning, he is witnessing that in the five elements, [in the] mind, intellect, ego, [and in] the superior, mediocre and inferior qualities - that the Atom of Brahman-Being is in all - even if he does not abide all of the time in that Purusha, rebirth does not happen for him, and even if it has happened, it has not happened, because he has become That Brahman-Being.
