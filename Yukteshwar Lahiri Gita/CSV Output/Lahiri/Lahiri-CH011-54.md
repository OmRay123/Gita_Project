[Commentary:]55) Do My actions - meaning Kriya, which is transmitted via Guru - for Me verily - abiding in Kutastha - examining thoroughly and having faith in Guru - therefore, seeing this Form, desires do not go to other things - residing always in the Pure Brahman, when you see all as the same, then wrongful feelings [and behavior] can never manifest - whosoever stays in this state - he attains Me - meaning, the Self remains in the Self - which is the par avastha of Kriya.ity srimadbhagavadgitasupanishatsu brahmavidyayam yogashastre srikrishnarjunasamvade vishvarupadarshanam nama ekadashohdhyayahThus ends the Eleventh Chapter.
