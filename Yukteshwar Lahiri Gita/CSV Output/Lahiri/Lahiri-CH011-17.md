### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]18) It is You Who is the Eternal Kutastha - That is what is worthy of Knowing - You are Supreme - You are beyond all - all Cosmos and samsara - beyond all - the Abode of Tranquility where all is extinguished - You are the Indestructible, Eternal Protector of the Secret Dharma = Kriya - that which is secret is acquired through the teaching of Guru - the Eternal Being.  This is my experience - meaning, this is manifesting within.
