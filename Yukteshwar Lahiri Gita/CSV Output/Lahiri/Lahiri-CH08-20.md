### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]21) The Unspeakable Kutastha is Imperishable - thus, what has been written [here] is transmitted by Guru!! - the cause of that Stillness - after going to which place and being Tranquil, one does not want to disengage from the par avastha of Kriya - meaning, the mind does not go in other directions!!! That is My Supreme Abode - meaning, it is there where I remain ensconced.
