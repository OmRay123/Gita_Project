### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]53) Ego, might, arrogance - meaning, going about with one’s chest puffed up, desire, anger, someone else’s house - meaning, not putting mind on other things except Brahman - from all of these - upon abiding in the par avastha of Kriya fully, one is freed from all of these aforementioned sense-matters; in that par avastha of Kriya, neither is there “me”, nor is there “mine” - which all Kriyanvita persons are experiencing; this is called Peace - meaning the end of Kriya itself - continuing to do this for a long time, one becomes Brahman Himself.
