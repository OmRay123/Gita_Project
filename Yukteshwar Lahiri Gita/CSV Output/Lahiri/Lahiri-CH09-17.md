### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]18) I am the Way - I am the Lord of life maintenance - I have become a single person in My small part - It is in Me that everyone resides - I am the one that everyone is to remember - meaning, everyone should meditate upon Me - when the body is beautifully proper, there is revelation - It from Me that everyone is manifesting completely - meaning, arising is from My Mind and complete dissolution is in That Itself - “nidhanam” = the place for everyone to be in their Tranquil True Self - the place of emergence for all - meaning, the Seed Brahman.  That has no destruction.
