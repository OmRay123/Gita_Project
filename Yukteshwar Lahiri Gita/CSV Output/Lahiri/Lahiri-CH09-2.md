### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]3) The person who does not abide in Brahman and does not perform this Kriya - thus does not attain me - not attaining, becoming disengaged from Atman, putting attachment-filled attention on other things, for the sake of the enjoyment of sensory objects - meaning, performing action with the craving for results and doing such business of give and take - for the fulfillment of such enjoyment, birth and death happens to him.
