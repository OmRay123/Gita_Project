### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]15) That which is established in Pure Silence in the heart of all people, which is in Yonimudra (transmitted via the teaching of Guru)* - still, one puts an amulet around the neck and goes around elsewhere, beating one’s drum and shouting.  The Stillness that is in the par avastha of Kriya is also in the heart - that is what is known as “jnana” [Divine Knowledge] - if you want to know everything - then stay in the par avastha of Kriya (Stillness).**  Because, then no desire for any sense objects remain there - the desire to know does not remain either - no other thing besides you remains at all, and when all have become one, and that One is You, then All have verily become One.  Thus, everything is verily known.  To know and know, people murder; that knowing, that which is worthy of knowing - if you but abide in the par avastha of Kriya, you will be able to know!!!  Knowing - there is no knowing unless there are two things - one person will know, and will know one thing.  In the par avastha of Kriya, all become one; two does not exist then; thus, just by two not being there, the end to knowing has been brought about.  Therefore, the state that must be attained after having read and heard Vedanta - all of that knowing is completely finished by Him in one moment’s abidance.  OM OM OM knowing that - or that which should be known - that can also be known automatically and spontaneously in the par avastha of Kriya.  Veda - knowledgeable matter - knowing - that Veda, if Guru bestows Grace - meaning, if you yourself bestow Grace, you can know in one moment’s abidance.  OM - people are going on, turned away from this Supreme Thing.[* and **Translator’s note:  The parentheses -( )- and the text within them are in the original.  The bracketed -[ ]- comment is the translator’s, used for the purposes of clarification.]
