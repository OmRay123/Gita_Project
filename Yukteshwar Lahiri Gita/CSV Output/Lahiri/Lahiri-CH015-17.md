### Commentary

[Commentary:]18) Thus, in Kutastha, what is beyond the destructible can be seen in You yourself; thus, beyond the Indestructible - Supreme - meaning, a Person can be seen - which has been written about by noble beings, after knowing thoroughly - that is what is known as Veda - OM - that Veda was birthed from Omkar, and that Omkar is in the form of this body - that which can be known via this body is called Veda OM OM OM - therefore, knowing thoroughly, the subject of Purushottama has been spoken about in all scriptures - Yaba is of one’s own house; that is called Indrayaba, knowing which one can know like Yaba; not knowing which, who knows how big Indrayaba will be!!!  Meaning, knowing via the transmission of the teachings of Guru, everything is easy - and Ramachandra Himself is attained in Sahaj Kriya (which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru).*[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]
