### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]9) All karma of Prakriti is also happening under the control held by the sense organs - but I am apart from all such karma - all such karma cannot bind Me - because I am residing in My Self Itself - sitting on top of the head - or - sitting there and not having attention in other directions like everyone else, there is no attachment to other things - I am residing in Atman Itself - thus, attached to Atman.
