[Commentary:]57) Knowing good and bad as the same - his prajna* is settled.**[*Translator’s note:  “Prajna” is the conglomeration of mind, consciousness, intellect, discrimination and wisdom. ”Sthitaprajna” is the merged and still “prajna.”  Because there is no adequate parallel in English, this definition is necessary.** The word “settled” in this case refers to the merged and still condition of “prajna.”]
