### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]25) This Nirvana - sages become free of sin - meaning attention does not go in directions other than Brahman - therefore, the differentiation of “two things” does not remain - Atman becomes the One Guru - because of this happening, this kind of wish comes:  that all beings become benefited by this, meaning receive this Kriya.
