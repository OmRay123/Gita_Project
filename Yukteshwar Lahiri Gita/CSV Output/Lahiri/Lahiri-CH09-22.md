### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]23) Whoever meditates reverently upon other gods besides Atman - without completely stilling oneself - it is upon Me that he meditates - because the attention of his mind is for a while upon that god itself - but does not completely still his mind and remain - “vidhi” - meaning, perfectly remaining in intelligence is called “vidhi.”
