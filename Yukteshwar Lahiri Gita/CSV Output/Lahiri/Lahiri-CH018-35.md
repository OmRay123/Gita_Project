### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]36) Happiness of three kinds - via practice; the place that one reaches upon doing Kriya - such beautiful happiness is there - upon abiding in the par avastha of Kriya and witnessing the Supreme Sky - of distance - meaning sorrow - looking at other things with attachment - “duhkha” [sorrow] is what but of distance - “kha” = emptiness; looking at the empty colorful and shiny forms of the five elements, being stuck to those very things, people become encumbered; this is what is called “duhkha” - this is happening all the time to everyone, but this duhkha is ended in the par avastha of Kriya.
