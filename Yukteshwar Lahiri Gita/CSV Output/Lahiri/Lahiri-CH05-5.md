### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]6) If there is no yoga, then there is sorrow in the practice of renunciation [sannyas] - being united in yoga, one goes quickly to Brahman - because when one casts off one thing from the mind, another thing appears.  Through yoga, the mind is stilled, and thus that [appearance of endless things to renounce] cannot again happen.
