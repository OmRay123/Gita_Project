### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]3) One who knows that I have no birth and no beginning, and that I am the Ishvar of all people - as soon as the breath stills - is Maheshvar - he, not at all mesmerized by the earthly plane - all sins - meaning, mind does not go in directions other than Brahman - therefore, if one always abides in Brahman one-pointedly, there will be liberation.
