### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]31) Therefore, in One is all, in all is One; then where is Its beginning?  Then, where are the gunas even?  Because gunas have all become Brahman - they have merged in Brahman in the place after Kriya - in the par avastha of Atman, Stillness has been attained - That which is Infinite even though Settled; where is any destruction for That?  He - meaning, the one to whom this type of Knowledge has happened - even while residing in the body, is not doing anything - anything is Brahman - doing is also Brahman!!  Therefore, he is not doing anything - if there were another substance, then he could become enmeshed; all is Brahman; thus he is “nirlipta” [non-enmeshed, non-engulfed].
