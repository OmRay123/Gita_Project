### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]15) The one from whom no harm comes to any person - and the one by whose work people are not disturbed - sorrow and pleasure, fear and anxiety - which never at all happens to drunkards - in that way, the “jivanmukta” person who resides in the par avastha of Kriya - the one who remains as the Self in the bliss of the Self is the Self who is dear to the Self.
