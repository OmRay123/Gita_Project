### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]57) Because Brahman Himself is doing all work via consciousness, knowing this ends all karma; because another person is performing whatever action; if you are not doing that karma [action], then for you that karma is eradicated - “matparah” = remain always in Atman and perform Kriya; through intelligence - meaning, via Stilled consciousness and abiding in the par avastha of Kriya, you will automatically do all work, which is the peculiar condition of sages, which automatically happens from the continuous practice of Kriya.
