### Commentary

[Commentary:]43) “Shouryam” = performing Kriya = by that, showing one’s abilities; “dhriti” = spontaneously abiding in the par avastha of Kriya; “dakhyam” - meaning, always performing Kriya, which is acquired through the teaching of Guru - does not move from doing Kriya - meaning, does Kriya day and night; gives Kriya; always establishes in Stillness in the Heart after Kriya - this is the work of kshatriyas, abiding in this par avastha of Kriya.
