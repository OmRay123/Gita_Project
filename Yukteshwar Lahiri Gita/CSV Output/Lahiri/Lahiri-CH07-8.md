### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]9) The beautiful scent of a flower from the earth also has no form, yet, coming into Prakriti, it is manifesting itself as a scent - that is also My form.  The heat of the sun, which is coming from space - one is not able to see it in space, but taking recourse in Prakriti, it is being known in its form of heat - in that way, one is not seeing anything of the Formless Brahman in the body - but the energy of that Shakti - abiding at the Manipura - is manifesting through speaking - life [jivan], meaning Mahadeva, who is kshetrajna* - no one is seeing Him - Who can be known through the teachings of Guru - through all His acts, meaning through movement etc. - His manifestation is evident in all jivas residing in Prakriti.  All is seen in Tapoloka, meaning in Kutastha.  That which no one can see, but is actually within all.  Thus, He is the One who is Brahman - My True Form.[*Translator’s note: “kshetrajna” is the immortal Soul in every individual.]
