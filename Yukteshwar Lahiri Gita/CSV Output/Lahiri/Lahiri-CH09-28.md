### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]29) I preside in all phenomena equally - the way that the thread is the same throughout the garlanded bunch - neither do I hate anything, nor do I love anything - one who meditates upon Me with devotion - meaning, performs Kriya - I also meditate upon him - meaning, abiding within him, I also perform Kriya.
