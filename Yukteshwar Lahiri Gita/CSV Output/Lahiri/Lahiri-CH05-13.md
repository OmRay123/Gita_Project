### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]14) “I am doing” - Kutastha does not say this type of thing - neither does He perform any action with the desire for results - but He is creating everything - and He is manifesting as the Highest - He has no connection with the fruits of actions - He is residing in Himself in His own “Bhava.”  “Bhava” - meaning the Tranquil Stillness beyond the three gunas - after Kriya.
