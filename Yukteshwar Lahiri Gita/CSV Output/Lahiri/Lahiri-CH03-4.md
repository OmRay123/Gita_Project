### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]5) No one remains even for a moment without karma [act]. Performing all karma [acts] while being in the dutiful karma - that is the karma that is happening - because its doer is Brahmasutra Sushumna - within whom is the entire Cosmos/samsara - He is the Primal Person - all-pervading.  The five elements, mind, intellect, ego - all perform karma under the power of these - sattva, rajah, tamah - by ida, pingala, sushumna’s gunas [effecting qualities].
