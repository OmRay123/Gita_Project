### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]8) Not residing in Atman - putting attachment-filled attention in other things is called “tamoguna” - meaning, pingala - all embodied ones - meaning, Mahadeva - have been kept mesmerized; otherwise the jiva itself is Shiva - meaning, performance of Kriya, which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru.  All of these acts by which He is being bound - with complete attachment in those, with chitta gone in that direction, full of expectation, like a drunken fool, what He says to whomever - false, and cannot pursue things - not being able to do so, He is agitated by His own heat [madness] and thus is madly dancing in many forms, and is passing through time in this way.  And He says “I have no time for anything” - and what He does, that He also does not know, because He is drunk!!!!  When opportunity for some good karma [action] comes in front of Him, to that He says, “I will do it later” - that “later” becomes later and later, and after that is sleep!!!!!!! OM.  As much as there is no priority, it is even more than that - meaning - even after having gone to bed in the early evening, rising late in the first part of the day - laziness - how many days like this?  Without a [physical] jail - even if it is said, it will not be heeded - what strange bondage without any binding - meaning, oneself is bound by oneself - meaning, no one even says “you should go to sleep” - “prostitute yourself” and such things.
