### Commentary 
 --- 
[Commentary:]5) Some are experiencing Self-Revelation, some are listening to the Omkar Sound, some are in the revelation of Supreme Light, some are sitting after having performed the act, some are sitting intoxicated and immersed in the Bliss of the Self in themselves, some - with mind stilled in Brahman - are seeing everything - they are the greatest among all human beings.
