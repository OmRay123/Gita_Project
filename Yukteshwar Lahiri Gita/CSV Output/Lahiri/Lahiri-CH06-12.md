[Commentary:]13) Keeping body and neck straight - stilling vayu, you will look at the sights at the place before the nose (after knowing from the mouth of Guru).*[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.  The phrase “mouth of Guru” comes from the Bengali “guru mukhe,” which refers to direct and personal initiation and transmission  from Guru.]
