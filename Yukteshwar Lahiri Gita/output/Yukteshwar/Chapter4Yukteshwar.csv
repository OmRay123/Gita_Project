"1, 2",Sri Bhagavan said: imam vivasvate yogam proktavanahamavyayam vivasvan manave praha manurikshvakavehabravit - 1- evam paramparapraptamimam rajarshayo viduh sa kaleneha mahata yogo nashtah paramtapa - 2-,"The Lord again spoke to Arjuna I taught this Eternal Knowledge to the Sun-god The lord of the day taught it to the god of obsequies, Manu Manu taught it to Ikshvaku - 1- Through lineage sages attained perfection through this yoga’s method That lineage-bestowed yoga disappeared - 2-","Commentary: By scientific research in both this country and the West, it has been thoroughly proven that the sun is an incredibly powerful sphere of electrical conduction (powerful electric conductor).  From its electricity, the creation, sustenance and dissolution work of this world is being accomplished.  The light that is radiating all around it is only pure, condensed electricity.  The saintly scriptural scholars have analyzed the subtle body’s source as “suksham bhuta,” “mahabhuta” or “tanmatra.”  And that, by focusing steadily, the blue sphere that can be seen in the middle of the sun is from where that “mahabhuta” (electricity) emerges and dissolves.  This place is hidden from all of the senses, and as such, it is empty and dark, which is why it appears as a blue form.  All of the sukhsham bhutas [electricity] arise from that and accomplish the works of creation, preservation and dissolution.  The scriptural scholars have said that blue form in the sun is the cause of this world-Brahmanda and thus called it the three-guna-endowed Prakriti [Trigunamayi Prakriti].  All of these sukhsham bhutas (electricity) emerge from that and manifest themselves as many conditions of existence, the mixing of which creates the appearance of this physical world, and flooding the world internally, pervading everything, they are perpetually eroding and doing the work of destruction.  Because all of these mahabhutas (electricity) are coagulated, meaning condensed, around the sun, they are visible to the senses, but because they are in a rarefied state in other things of the world, one cannot even perceive their existence.  The saintly scriptural scholars have called this aggregate of different kinds of suksham bhutas pervading the inner workings of everything and operating the creation, preservation and dissolution of all as the “subtle body” of the world.  The mixing of these suksham bhutas (by five elemental ways) give rise to this visible world of material substances which the scholars have called the “physical [or material] body.”  A sun and its planets and satellites can be called a “solar system” or Brahmanda.  All of the stars that we see in sky are other suns, most of which are many times larger than our sun.  They also have planets and satellites orbiting them; each of them is also a solar system or Brahmanda.  There are infinite numbers of Brahmandas in this Universe, and throughout the every Brahmanda are the three bodies - physical, subtle and causal - present, which comprise the Universe.  All matter in the world is a part of this Brahmanda; therefore, the three bodies - physical, subtle and causal - are present in everything, partly visible and partly invisible.  With the diminution of impurity, these bodies gradually reveal themselves.  This subject has been explained extensively in sloka 70 of the second chapter.  After traveling through eight million four hundred thousand yonis, the jiva is purified and attains the highest physical form in this Brahmanda as a human being, in which all of these bodies are fully revealed.  Because the above-mentioned three bodies, sun, moon, stars etc. - everything in the Brahmanda as mentioned are present in this body, the saintly scriptural scholars call this the “miniature Brahmanda.”  By the Sadguru-graced Kriya, when the mind is stilled, one experiences the above-mentioned sun, moon etc., all in full form in the body.  This cannot be acquired by indirect knowledge; it can only be known by one’s direct experience.  Without the sacrament of the Holy Feet of Sadguru, this direct knowledge cannot be experienced. From the sacrament of Sadguru, one can also become aware that among the nadis present in this body, there are three which are primary - ida, pingala and sushumna.  Ida is on the left side, pingala is on the right and the sushumna is in the middle of the body.  Ida is like a door of meditation.  By it, the mind can rid itself of unhappiness and become cheerful.  For this reason, the saintly scriptural scholars call the presiding god in it, “Chandra [moon]” (chad - the substance of delight).  By the Guru-instructed Kriya, sadhakas experience this moon as a comely, snowy sphere in front of them.  Pingala is like a door of knowledge.  When the mind is stilled by this, knowledge is revealed.  For this reason, the scriptural saints call its presiding god, “Surya [sun]” (sri - substance of motion and knowledge).  The sadhakas by Guru-instructed Kriya experience this in the as a fiery sun in the back.  By singing, “The right-side air; in the back country beneficence, etc.,” in his world-renown song, the great sadhaka Ramprasad gave a hint of the method of the practice to call forth the presiding god of the impurity eroding, knowledge-revealing pingala.  Meditation, knowledge, renunciation and tranquility are the first, second, third and fourth levels, respectively, of gradual progress on the path of sadhana.  When the mind eventually becomes happy through meditation, knowledge becomes necessary for its steadfastness.  In this way, as the mind attains happiness and steadiness by meditation and knowledge, it is then understood that - all of the things about which I was so concerned saying, “Mine, mine” - none of it, not even the body is owned by the jiva..  Thus, as a jiva I own nothing in this world-Brahmanda, or, All is Mine as this World-Pervading Consciousness.  If I were not here, then none of all this could be here.  This world and Brahmanda are existing in Me.  The king-sage Janaka expressed this, after having received Knowledge-initiation from his gurudev, Maharshi Ashtavakra.  As in - yatha prakashayamyekam dehamenam tatha jagat ato mama jagat sarvamathava cha na kinchana -   Ashtavakra Samhita 2:2. When knowledge is established, all desires are renounced at once, and in this way, when meditation, knowledge and renunciation are established, the mind moves into the sushumna and procures tranquility.  This sushumna is a place filled with peace.  When the mind is pacified by it, the Eternal Consciousness Itself is revealed.  For this reason, the saintly scriptural scholars call the Lord of All, world-ruling, Triguna-owning Consciousness as the presiding God of the sushumna.  It is from these three nadis that the sixty thousand nadis have arisen and are actively present throughout the body.  Maharshi Vedavyas wrote about these three in the Mahabharata as the moon-family, the sun-family and the “vrishni”-family (vrish-ni:  “vrish” - being the lord; ruling) as primary families. When one becomes aware of all this by acquiring Sadguru’s teaching, one can explain these two slokas as such:  when by the previously mentioned way the evasive desire is eradicated and the Supreme Self-Substance is realized, gradually the causal body in the form of the sun appears between the eyebrows in this miniature Brahmanda-body, the place of manifestation.  And by that, it can be clearly known that this causal body, or the sun, is united with Consciousness by the union with the Kutasthachaitanya.  And from this sun, the electricity radiating from all around it having attained Consciousness is existing as Manu, the source of the human body.  And it is from this, having attained Consciousness, the ajna chakra is existing as the primary door to the wisdom of nivritti.  And from this the chakras such as Muladhar etc. are residing in the significant parts of the body, prevailing in Consciousness-union.  Finally, this Consciousness is spread out all throughout the sixty thousand nadis in such a way that even Its existence cannot be readily known. - 1 and 2-"

The Western scholars had deduced that heat and force constituted the life-energy in this world.  The great scientist Tyndal concluded that heat is also a type of force or shakti in motion.  Now, in all scientific treatises of this country and the West, it has been extensively proven that shakti (force) is the life of the Universe, and that it is indestructible; it never ceases to exist.  When shakti engages any inert matter, it remains present there eternally.  This solar system is endlessly orbiting with its planets and satellites because of this law.  From this a question can appear that if shakti uses a stone and that stone travels endlessly in space without stopping, then what stops it, and how, if shakti does not diminish, does it cease?  It has been concluded in science that for the stone to travel on its own, shakti employs the gravitational force of the earth and the air.  When force is used in this way, the stone becomes forceless and stops.  That is not the diminution of shakti; it is only a transfer of power from one object to another.  Therefore, shakti is infinite and thus unborn.  It is this shakti that rules in all matter as the forces of attraction and repulsion, by which It is making the existence of innumerable designs of matter and scenarios possible, through birth and death, again and again.  These two types of shakti is in every atom of the world.  The attraction aspect of the shakti in atoms and molecules is called “anavik asakti” (molecular attraction), and the repulsion aspect is called “abhyantarika taap” (latent heat).  Because of the shakti of molecular attraction, the atoms and molecules are bound to each other and are perpetually manifesting this world-Brahmanda.  And because of that heat or repulsion shakti, the atoms and molecules have divided and created the different and separate forms of this world-Brahmanda.  It is by the power of this shakti of Prakriti that all molecules take on the five states - kshiti (solid), ap (liquid), teja (subgaseous), marut (gaseous) and vyoma (ethereal).*  The scholars of shastra have called these “suksham bhutas” or “mahabhutas.”  It is they who, by mixing with one another, are appearing as this physical world.  Their abilities are amazing.  They are breaking down this material world and again reconstructing everything appropriate for the existence of the jiva.  By these, all jivas are designed according to what is appropriate in terms of the materials necessary for existence, and after the leaving the body, again by them does the jiva take a new form as necessary and reenter samsara.  In this way, it is by their power that all matter in this world is created, sustained and dissolved, and it is because of their presence that this world-Brahmanda is existing. [*Translator’s note:  kshiti, ap, teja, marut and vyoma are also the Sanskrit names of the five elements - earth, water, fire, air and ether, respectively.] The neutralized state of these forces of attraction and repulsion is the unmanifest potential condition of the world.  Just as when a neutralized magnet is altered for some reason it becomes imbued with the three gunas sattva (neuter), raja (positive) and tama (negative) and manifests attractive and repulsive forces, in the same way, when the neutralized Infinite Brahman-Consciousness’ unmanifest potential condition, meaning the condition of Prakriti is altered in the slightest, the three gunas sattva (neuter), raja (positive) and tama (negative) appear, spawning attractive and repulsive forces which create the world in its many forms.  The neutralized state of the sattva, raja and tamogunas born of the world-creating Shakti is called the unmanifest potential state, the revealed condition or Prakriti of that Infinite Brahman-Consciousness.  As in- sattvarajastamasam samyavastha prakritirityadi -   ka. su. 1:61 When this gunas of Prakriti rest even for a moment, this vast solar system dissolves with its planets and satellites, and this Universe at once disappears.  Creation is existing by holding the revealed condition or Prakriti of this Infinite Consciousness.  That which can be held on to is called “dharma” (dhri - holding).  Therefore, the only “dharma” in this vast solar system and this Universe is the realization of this Eternal Brahman-Consciousness. Now, this sloka can be explained as such:  when the revealed condition of this Eternal Brahman-Consciousness, meaning Prakriti’s quality-less or neutralized or inner-directed state-dharma, is altered, then the outer-directed, Consciousness-hidden “adharma” [non-dharma] state manifests, giving rise to the three gunas with the forces of attraction and repulsion, by which that Eternal Consciousness plays out Its own “sport” [lila] in innumerable ways, meaning that via the vehicles of different bodies, It appears as this visible world. - 7-"
8,paritranaya sadhunam vinashaya cha dushkritam dharmasamsthapanarthaya sambhavami yuge yuge - 8-,I save the persons of dharma Evil people are the cause of everyone’s demise And to establish universal [sanatan] dharma I take birth age [yuga] after age - 8-,"Commentary: To comprehend this sloka, it is important to first understand the meaning of the word “yuga” and find out the reason for its repeated use.  Thus, I will explain the matter below. One meaning of yuga is time divided in four parts, as in - Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga.  These divisions of yugas have been so named because of the condition of dharma at the time; meaning that when all four parts of dharma - complete - manifiest, the age is named Satya; when only three parts manifest, it is Treta; when two, it is Dvapara and when only one part of dharma manifests, the yuga is called Kali.  In the previous sloka it has been extensively addressed that only the Eternal Brahman-Consciousness is sustaining this vast solar system and this Universe, and the realization of this Satchitananda-filled Brahman-Consciousness is the only dharma.  That Eternal Consciousness can be perceived in this creation in three forms:  one form being the tama-ruled physical cosmos; another form is the raja-ruled subtle state of molecules as the holder of the physical world, and the third form is the atomic level as the creator of the world and the cause of emergence and dissolution. Conditions always change in creation; no condition is permanent.  When creation transforms from Eternal Consciousness into physical matter, in order to again return progressively on the path of Consciousness, it continuously transmutes all forms of life, mind etc. from their present states.  For this reason, the saintly scriptural scholars have said that the tama-ruled physical part is the destroyer/transformer; the raja-ruled subtle part is the cause of the accomplishment of the creation of the physical part, and thus has been called the creator, and the sattva-ruled causal part has been called the holder/sustainer.  These forms of the lords of creation, sustenance and destruction have been named in Tantra as Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshvara [respectively].  Consciousness is the only One who is present in all three as named in creation; therefore, these three are just that One Brahman-Consciousness. Perceiving these three parts in the Consciousness-prevailing creation, the saintly philosophical scholars have said that the fourth part, being beyond name, form, the hierarchal structure of the three conditions [previously mentioned in this and the previous paragraph] and creation itself, is still presiding inseparably and behind everything in the manifested world.  They have called that “Turiya Brahman-Consciousness.” At the time when the jiva in any planet or satellite perceives only the first part of consciousness - the physical world, that time for that planet or satellite is called “Kali Yuga.”   When, by the evolution of the jiva’s experiential powers, the jiva can perceive the second part of Consciousness - the subtle world, which is the creator of the physical world, that time is called “Dvapara Yuga.”  At the time when the jiva’s purification allows the perception of the third part of Consciousness - the causal form, which is sustaining and holding creation, that time is called “Treta Yuga.”  And the time when the jiva is completely purified and awakened in Truth, and thus perceives the Satchitananda-filled Turiya Brahman-Consciousness, that time is called “Satya Yuga.”  The saintly scriptural scholars have also called the same progressive states in this miniature Universe of the human body as such, meaning:  experiencing one part of Eternal Consciousness is the state of being called Kali Yuga [kali yugavastha], experiencing two parts constitute the state of being called Dvapara Yuga [dvapara yugavastha], experiencing three parts comprise the state of being called Treta Yuga [treta yugavastha], and the realization of the complete four parts of the Satchitananda-filled Turiya Brahman-Consciousness is the state of being called Satya Yuga [satya yugavastha]. Because of perpetually transforming into different forms, in accordance with physical law, the previous forms of all matter in this body gradually decay.  And by sweat, respiration, urination etc., the waste from such decay are expelled from the body.  One has to eat every day in order to compensate for this erosion.  Food is assimilated and spread throughout the body by blood, filling the place left by the cleaning out of waste products brought about by decay, and thus the body is sustained.  In this way, old fluids and blood in the body are transformed into new fluids and blood.  The daily gradual decay of the old and replenishing with the new accumulates into changing all of the muscle and fat of a person into all new muscle and fat in the span of a lunar month.  In this way, in one solar year, all of the veins, arteries and nerves, and thereby even the ten senses and five pranas of the subtle body are completely transformed into new creation.  For this reason, one year of this physical world has been said to be one day in the plane of the gods or the body of the subtle world.  In three solar years (which is 39 lunar months, when calculated with the intercalary month, the beginning and end), sperm, marrow etc., and thereby even the mind and intellect and all subtle elements are completely transformed into new creation.  These three years are referred to by some as one “khanda yuga.”  In four of these khanda yugas, meaning in twelve solar years - according to Western physiology, in seven solar years - the entire natural body, including even consciousness and the causal body - all three bodies, are completely changed and the human being takes a completely new natural form.  In this way, in 12 years, all parts of a human being are transformed, and with new nature, intellect, mind, prana, senses etc., a new human body and being are created. The jiva eats many kinds of food, but not all of them are appropriate for the maintenance of the body.  Because of cultural habits and the norms of the company one keeps, affinity for certain things and repulsion toward certain things arise in the subtle body.  Thus, the subtle body maintains the body by eating the foods with which it has affinity, and unknowingly leaves out food which it dislikes.  In this way, according to its habits and desires due to samskaras, the body gradually changes into a completely new thing in 12 years.  For this reason, although meat and milk are both excellently nourishing foods, neither the meat-eating person relying on milk, nor the milk-consuming person relying on meat can properly maintain the health of their respective bodies.  According to the jiva’s nature and samskara-based desires, it maintains its body with either with “high quality” foods, meaning that which aids in the revelation of Consciousness, or “low quality” foods, meaning that which is bound to the material world and keeps one in ignorance.  This means that when sense-desires are predominant, one will consume foods that are appropriate for that, and when the desire for the realization of Consciousness is predominant, the jiva will take consciousness-based foods and maintain its body in that way.  Thus, according to either the improvement or decline of habits and samskara-based desires of the jiva, in the previously mentioned 12 years, either a completely new god-nature or animal-nature prevails in the body, by which, one is transformed into the form of a new jiva.  For this reason, the saintly scriptural scholars have called these 12 years as one yuga. It is in written in the Vedanta as well as explained in the commentary on sloka 70 of the third chapter of this book that when the jiva’s capacity of awareness evolves, and by which when it is able to realize the vital force within the material body and then the mind within that, eventually evolving to possess the ability to operate intellectually, it assumes a human form.  In this way, up to the time of acquiring the human body, there is no possibility of the progress of the jiva to go awry in any way, because without having the ability to function intellectually, there is no type of desire that the jiva wants to fulfill; therefore, Consciousness reveals Itself consistently, and the jiva attains a more evolved state of existence according to natural law.  But what a terrible condition befalls the jiva when it becomes aware of the jnanamaya cover!  The acquisition of freedom in the power of desire causes the jiva to become involved in habitual indiscretions, and not to speak of natural evolution, from time to time, being bound to one’s own engagements by that power of desire, the jiva falls and again reincarnates in the form of insects and such.  If the human being does not use the intellect, or if one does not possess that power, then step by step, in 12,000 years the full four-fold realization of Consciousness will manifest and thereby the jiva can possess a new body of complete bliss.  This subject of evolution in time of the material world along with the creation of maya to the presiding of only the Kaivalya of Brahman-Consciousness is written in the Manu Samhita.  As in – pitryeratrahanimasah pravibhagastupakshayoh karmacheshta svahah krishnah shuklah svapnaya sharvari daive ratra hani varham pravibhagastayoh punah ahastatrodagayanam ratrih syaddakshinayanam chatvaryahuh sahasrani varshanantu kritam yugam tasya tavacchati sandhya sandhyamshashcha tathavidhah itareshu sasandheshu sa sandhyamsheshu cha trishu ekapayena vartante sahasrini shatani cha yadetat parisamkhyatamadadeva chaturyugam etaddvadashasahasram devanam yugamuchyate daivikanam yuganantu sahasram parisamkhyaya brahmamekamaharjneyam tavati ratrireva cha One lunar month is one “aho ratri” of the plane of the father, meaning this physical body given by the father.  Within that, the dark fortnight is the day, meaning that this physical body is awake and active, and the bright fortnight is night, meaning that only that which is necessary to function does so in a way that is like sleep.  This matter can be clearly understood by observing the work of honey-bees.  They have no intellectual capacity; they accomplish everything bound to natural law.  They rest during the bright fortnight and once the full moon has passed, they return to work.  And they work tremendously throughout the dark fortnight.  Once the new moon passes, they return to their abodes for rest.  And they only maintain the minimal functioning of their lives - only eating and such - throughout the bright fortnight. In this way, 12 orbits around the sun, meaning one solar year is one aho ratri in the plane of the gods, meaning the body of providence or the subtle body.  Within that, the summer solstice marks the day of the subtle body, meaning the time of awakened activity, and the winter solstice marks the night, meaning the state of sleep and the time of rest, when only minimal functioning is maintained. Kulukabhatta, the primary interpreter of the Manu Samhita, has explained the word “varsha” [year] as “daiva varsha” [year of the subtle body], but one can see no reason for this.  There is no mention of “daiva varsha” anywhere in this, instead it seems to clearly indicate the physical year.  Therefore, I will explain the meaning of this sloka as would be naturally understood. 4,000 solar years make one Satya Yuga.  Its dawn, meaning the transitional period of its beginning is 400 years, and its dusk, meaning the transitional period of its end is 400 years.  In this way, 4,800 years comprise one Satya Yuga.  The Treta Yuga and the others and their dawns and dusks are comprised of the number of years calculated by progressively subtracting one from the digit in the “thousands” and “hundreds” place, respectively, as delineated to the Satya Yuga and its transitional periods.  This means that Treta Yuga is 3,000 years in duration and its dawn is 300 years long, as well as its dusk also being 300 years in length.  Dvapara Yuga has 2,000 years, its dawn being 200 years and its dusk at 200 years in length.  Kali Yuga consists of 1,000 years and its dawn is 100 years and its dusk is 100 years.  Thus, along with the transitional periods, one complete Treta Yuga is 3,600 years long; the time of Dvapara Yuga is 2,400 years; and the time of Kali Yuga is 1,200 years.  The above-mentioned 12,000 years comprising the four yugas make one yuga for the gods, meaning the body of providence or the subtle body, meaning that one part, two parts, three parts and eventually all four parts of Consciousness are gradually realized and the entire subtle body dissolves mind, intellect etc. and resides in a blissful state.  In this way, one thousand maha yugas in the time of the subtle body, meaning 12,000,000 years - by progressive elevation, even the causal body and maya are dissolved and the Kaivalya-form, or only the Pure Brahman-Consciousness Form is existent.  These 12,000,000 years of evolutionary time together are called one “day of Brahma.”  Having attained the state of Kaivalya and at the same time being devoid of Maya, the time of complete rest naturally occurs, and as no action is performed to maintain the Self, gradually maya manifests, and in 12,000,000 years again the material existence becomes predominant.  For this reason, these 12,000,000 years together are called one “night of Brahma.”  This is what is known as one “aho ratri” of Brahma, or total dissolution and creation. But what misfortune for the human being and what trickery by God!  Without the help of this knowledge, there is no possibility of realizing the anandamaya covering, and this knowledge is itself the step to bliss [ananda].  So is it the way of things that the human within the jiva is worthless and the capacity to operate intellectually is just some ironic mockery?  That can never be, because the jiva acquires this human body endowed with this high knowledge after traveling through eight million four hundred thousand yonis.  It is only the misuse of this high knowledge with selfish desires that causes the jiva to be bound like a silkworm endlessly spinning its own suffering.  If one knows the proper use of this knowledge then one can go beyond this horrific vaishnavi chakra maya, meaning that one can successfully go beyond even the laws of one’s nature.  The progress mentioned above which would take 12,000 years - that complete four-fold realization of Consciousness, the revelation of the anandamaya kosha and Kaivalya or Full God-ness,, pervading the Universe, can be attained in a short time through sadhana.  This subject has been extensively explained in the sloka 70 of the third chapter of this book. Now the significance of the mentioning of the word “yuga” twice shall be explained.  One mentioning of “yuga” is to explain at what kind of time or in what kind of condition this Brahman-Consciousness is fully manifest.  The reason for the other mentioning of “yuga” is to explain what kind of work leads to the emergence of that Consciousness.  About the first - as to the matter of the condition in which Consciousness manifests - it has been commented upon as thoroughly as possible.  For the moment, the second significance, meaning - what kind of method can the jiva use by which it can go beyond the vaishanavi chakra maya and thereby attain Consciousness-manifesting Full Brahman-ness in a short time, is being explained below. Besides the above-mentioned definition of “yuga,” there is another meaning.  In that, “yuga” refers to “yugma,” meaning - pair (yugmantu yugalam yugam ityamarah).  Now, one needs to see the meaning of “yugakriya” as “yugmakriya” or paired kriya.  This is what the Supreme Vishnu-seeing vaishanavas have called the practice of “yugal [paired] mantra.”  “Mana trayate ity mantra” - that by which the mind is liberated from maya is called “mantra.”  This subject has been written about in the introduction  of this book.  This type of meaning for the word “mantra” is also written in Tantra.  As in – brahmadi krimi paryantam praninam pranavartanam nishvasashvasarupena mantrohayam vartate priye At the Divine Goddess’ question, Lord Shiva says, “Beloved!  The in-breath and out-breath, which together hold the life of all living things of Brahman, even that of a worm, are called ‘mantra’.” Now it can be clearly understood that this pairing of in-breath and out-breath is the “yugal [paired] mantra.”  No one can live in this world by only taking the in-breath or only expelling the out-breath.  This Universe is manifesting bound to this yugal mantra.  Its absence causes the world-Brahmanda to disappear.  Therefore, the way to dissolve this world-Brahmanda in the mind, and even further, to merge the mind and intellect into the Self, meaning Atman, is the awakening through the practice of this yugal mantra in the form of the in-breath and the out-breath.  This subject is written about in every book of the vaishnavas.  It is because of the need to be aware of this mantra that the jiva again and again travels through birth after birth in one body after another, leaving behind the conditions of ignorance and fulfilling the total force of the acquired samskaras (resultant force), and eventually becomes aware of mantra.  Awakening this mantra in a certain way, by practicing according to the instructions of Sadguru, and establishing it in stillness, the entire Universe, including mind and intellect, dissolves and the Pure, Complete Consciousness-state is realized.  The saintly scholars of yogic scriptures call this practice the “kriya of pranayam.”  It is also written in the Patanjal Yoga Sutras that - the stilling of the movement of this yugal mantra of in-breath and out-breath, meaning the stilling of restlessness, is callled “pranayam.”  As in - shvasaprashvasayorgati vicchedah pranayamah -   Sadhanapada - no. 49 In this way, ending the restlessness of mantra and establishing pranayam causes all mechanisms of the body to be united with Consciousness, and when that happens, the jiva can leave the functioning of the body to those limbs and organs on their own, and the jiva as the Self can exist separate from the body.  This type of existence is what is called the “jivanmukta” state [liberated while having a body].  Teaching his disciple King Janaka about the matter of this liberation, Maharshi Ashtavakra said the same thing.  As in - na prithvi na jalam nagni na vayu dourna va bhavan esham shakshinamatmanam chidrupam viddhi muktaye yadi deham prithakakritya chiti vishramya tishthami adhunaiva sukhi shanta bandhomukta bhavishyashi -   Ashtavakra Samhita - 1 pra/ 3/4 “You are not made of earth, water, fire, air, ether - any such elemental matter.  If you desire liberation, then become aware of the Witness of all of these elements, meaning the One in whose vision all work and the appearance and disappearance of these elements are happening, that Consciousness - Atman - the Self.  If you can know the Self in this way and, being unattached to these quintelemental physical phenomena, if you can reside separately from the body in the Atman as Consciousness, meaning resting self in the Self, then, filled with Tranquility and Supreme Contentment, you will instantly be liberated from the bindings of samsara.” Now, I will explain below about the practice of yugal mantra, meaning the kriya [technology] of pranayam and how, by such, it is possible to go beyond the vaishnavi chakra maya, meaning - how to do the work that will in a short time actualize the four-fold, complete awareness of Consciousness that is realized in the normal course in the span of 12,000 years, meaning also - how to realize the Kaivalya, or Consciousness-alone, state which in the usual course of time takes 12,000,000 years. Because of the special quality of power in 12 places of the orbit around the sun, those places and the stars corresponding to it have been designated as the 12 signs of the zodiac by astrological scholars, and they ascribed the qualities of certain earthly creatures and other things to those signs and called them the sign of the ram [Aries], the sign of the bull [Taurus] etc. In that cycle of the zodiac, the moon, beginning on the first day of the bright fortnight, travels through six signs of the zodiac until the full moon, when the moon is at its furthest point away from the sun. And again, beginning on the first day of the dark fortnight, it goes through the other six signs until the new moon, when the moon is at its closest point near the sun. This moving away to the furthest point and moving back to the closest point to the sun, having gone through all 12 signs of the zodiac, is called one lunar month. In this way, the movement of 12 signs of the zodiac with the sun, beginning with one and ending back at that same one, constitutes one solar year. In one solar year, some of the 12th lunar month is left over, because of which, in three years, an extra lunar month is born. The ephemeris scholars call this the intercalary month. Thus, 37 lunar months comprise three solar years. It is written in astrological treatises that if the sun is beneficent at the time of one’s birth, meaning if the human being who is born into the body is carrying the good parts of the solar materials, then that being will be of great nobleness and wisdom. If the sun is maleficent during the time of one’s birth, meaning if the human being who is born into the body is carrying the bad parts of the solar materials, then that being will be tremendously egotistical and devoid of responsible behavior. In this way, observing the relationship of the good parts of solar materials to knowledge, or consciousness, and seeing that completely the same exact connection and results are true pertaining to yogakriya and the emerging sun within the body by it as to the realization of Knowledge, or Consciousness, along with much other evidence, the saintly yogic scholars have stated that the sun arising by Kriya within the miniature Universe of the body is a part of the sun in the cosmos and they have called it the human consciousness. In the same way, if the moon is beneficent at the time of one’s birth, meaning if the human being born into the body is carrying the good parts of the lunar materials, then that being has a calm and steady nature, and he or she is of a happy mind, pleasant to people, and passes life always in the company of good persons. If the moon is maleficent at the time of one’s birth, then that person is of a restless nature and is always unsatisfied, a nuisance to people, and he or she passes life in the company of bad persons. Thus, observing the relationship of the good parts of the lunar materials to the state of mind and its exact representation in the relationship of the moon in the body, emerging from yogakriya, to the state of mind - meaning the restlessness of the moon is the restlessness of the mind, and the stillness of the moon is the stillness of the mind and much other evidence - the saintly yogic scholars have stated that this moon in the miniature Brahmanda of this body revealed through yogakriya is a part of the external moon of the cosmos and they have called this the human mind. Observing the sushumna as the path of consciousness, and six special locations of power within the sushumna manifesting the radiance of consciousness all around those spots as lotus-like petals - from which consciousness spreads and presides as different gods in the sixty thousand nadis fulfilling every task in the body - the saintly yogic scholars have termed the likenesses of those special places in the sushumna as four-petaled, six-petaled, ten-petaled, twelve-petaled, sixteen-petaled and two-petaled lotuses; and they have understood that the sushumna is the path of the orbit of the jiva-consciousness sun and the lotuses are the points of the zodiac. The Supreme Yogi Lord Shiva and other great beings have taught that, according to Sadguru’s instructions, uniting the moon-like sattvic mind to the totality of rajoguna manifesting in the prana vayu [prana airs] and working this united form within the sushumna, traveling the six lotuses from the two-petaled to the Muladhar, the furthest point from the Sun - the jiva-Consciousness revealed in the Sahasrara - and again traveling through the six lotuses from the Muladhar to the two-petaled lotus - the nearest point to the Sun revealed as Consciousness - one month’s work [evolution] is accomplished. This means that within this short time all blood and flesh in the body is purified of material coagulation; thus, related addictions are also purified and the body begins to be prepared for the Holy Consciousness-substance. In this way, shooting the prana united with mind to the Muladhar and again drawing it from there is called one “kriya of pranayam” in yogic scriptures. By this, samskaras are removed from consciousness and happiness is maintained. In the Patanjal Yoga Sutras it is also written that joy at the time of pleasure for the jiva, compassion at the time of sorrow, satisfaction at doing good work and rejection of wrong work bring cheerfulness of mind. But that is external and remains only for a while, because the mind, within a short time, being a slave to the previous samskaras, becomes unhappy again. Therefore, in order to have happiness for a long time, one should cheer up one’s inner being by the samskara-purifying Kriya. By the Kriya of throwing, meaning shooting of the prana vayu downward and again drawing it, or yugal mantra, the samskaras are removed and this happiness remains for a long time. As in - maitrakarunamuditopekshanam sukhaduhkha punyapunyavishayanam bhavanashchittaprasadanam - no. 33 pracchardanavidharanyabhyam va pranasya - no. 34 - Samadhipada Practicing yugal mantra, or the kriya of pranayam at one sitting, including its dawn and dusk, 12 times, meaning 14 times, accomplishes the work of one solar year. This means that the material coagulation concerning arteries, veins and nerves, and thereby also the material coagulation of the body of providence or the subtle body and its ten senses and five pranas are cleared. Thus, their addictions are also purified and the body is prepared to receive the Holy Consciousness-substance. This is called “jada shuddhi.” With its dawn and dusk, doing this Kriya 37 times, meaning 39 times [at one sitting] accomplishes the work of three solar years, meaning the work of one “khanda yuga.” Thus, the material coagulation in sperm, marrow, all physical elements and thereby the material coagulation in mind and intellect are also purified, and the body is further prepared for the realization of the Holy Consciousness-substance. This is called “khanda shuddhi” or “nadi shuddhi.” And doing this Kriya, with its dawn and dusk, 148 times, meaning 150 times, accomplishes the work of 12 solar years. This means that the material coagulation of even the consciousness-nature, or the causal body, is cleared. Thus, purified of all addictions, the body begins to realize the longed-for, highest Holy Consciousness-substance. This is referred to as “bhuta shuddhi” in all Tantric scriptures. By this, the work of the twenty-four elements is fulfilled in a short time and it becomes possible to reside in bliss even while in this elemental body. Performing bhuta shuddhi just once this way brings complete happiness to the mind and that happiness remains for a long time. If there are no changes in the normal course, then, within a short time, no kind of unhappiness can come to the mind. It has been discovered in the scientific world that if electrical waves travel around all sides of an object, then that object becomes imbued with the qualities of attraction and repulsion and is transformed into the form of a magnet, and that the electrical waves do not enter the object; instead, they remain floating above it. The work of the telegraph is carried out by this method. One can observe by an electrometer that when an electrical conductor is heated from one side, from the other side, an electrical flow occurs and moves in the direction of the heated side. The earth is a massive electrical conductor. Whichever side the sun is on is heated. Therefore, from the other side of the earth an electrical flow moves towards the heated side. And because the earth is rotating towards the east, that heated section is continuously going west. Therefore that electrical flow is also encircling the earth in a westward direction. In this way, because electricity is perpetually spinning around the globular earth, the earth is imbued with the qualities of attraction and repulsion and is existing as a giant, highly powerful magnet. For this reason, the magnetic needle of a compass is always attracted towards the north and south. This electrical flow around the earth does not always travel with the same force. Its intensity decreases and increases. At midday, when the sun is directly above the head and at midnight, when the sun is directly below - at these times, because of the heated areas of the earth being directly above and directly below, the enjoined electrical fflow cannot have much intensity in the direction of east or west; but, because the earth is perpetually turning eastward and thereby the heated section is always moving westward, the electrical flow around the earth also maintains motion towards the west. At prangnatakal, meaning the time from midnight until midday, when the earth is being heated on the easterly side, there is another flow of electricity in that direction, and thus the above-mentioned perpetual flow of electricity connected with the rotation of the earth towards the west is diminished, and it continues its westward flow with very low intensity. And at the time of pashchannatakal, meaning the time from midday until midnight, the earth is heated in the westerly side and there is an electrical flow in that direction, causing the above-mentioned perpetual electrical flow connected with the rotation of the earth to move westward with double the intensity. Thus, because of an electrical flow perpetually moving westward around the earth and thereby causing the earth to behave like a magnet, the great sages of India forbid lying down with the head pointed towards the north or the west. As in - prakshiro bhavati vidya valamayushcha dakshine pashchime pravala chinta hani mrityumathottare Lying down with the head towards the east brings about knowledge and wisdom; lying with the head to the south increases strength; lying with the head towards the west causes turbulence in thought; and lying with the head towards the north brings death closer. The reason for this is that lying with the head towards the west causes the perpetually westward moving electrical flow to draw all of the impurities of the body to the head, which is the primary place of consciousness, and thereby all of these together cause the consciousness to become impure by which it falls into a stupor of ignorance or unawareness. Because of that, meaningless imaginary things arise in the head and the jiva becomes immersed in turbulent thoughts. But lying with the head pointing east causes the opposite action to happen and the primary place of consciousness - the head - is cleaned of impurities, and wisdom or knowledge is revealed. Similarly, because the section north of the equator is predominant in magnetic attraction flowing towards the north, lying with the head towards the north causes all of the airs to rise to the head depleting one of strength, and thereby, the body gradually becomes weak and problems arise within it, and death comes ever closer. But lying with the head towards the south causes the opposite action to take place, meaning the airs move downward which increases one’s strength, making the body robust and giving it long life. In this way, the decrease and increase of intensity of the electrical flow around the earth during the prangnatakal and pashchannatakal brings about significant change in the enjoined subtle world. And the physical world is also similarly changed significantly according to the changes in the degree of heat during the day and night. Thus, from 66/30 north of the equator to 66/36 south, covering 133 parts in this middle section of the earth, in a span of 24 hours, meaning one aho ratri, the physical part and the subtle part of everything, both go through a change twice - the total being four times. The plane of the gods, meaning the northern part of the world from 23/30 in the north and the plane of the monsters, meaning the southern 23/30 have six months of day and six months of night; the condition of the physical things presiding there do not go through any change within 24 hours; only the subtle bodies of those things go through a change only twice because of the decrease and increase of the intensity of the electrical flow during the prangnatakal and the pashchannatakal; and because there is no increase or decrease in the electrical flow or in the heat inside the earth, no change takes place in any matter present there. Therefore, the best and most pure place to practice this yogakriya is the asana within a cave. The next best place for asana is in the plane of the gods in the northern part. The southern part is filled with water, so the point is moot. And there are very few places that are pure for asana in the middle section on the earth. For this reason, even a little of the kriya practiced in other places has to be done by those residing in the middle section on the earth with great care and much effort in regards to the asana - in a place not too hot, not too cold, not draughty, on a deerskin upon which there should be a cloth with a material that iis a non-conductor etc. Therefore, the particulars of Kriya for the residents of the middle section on the earth, where there are not many pure places for asana, are being explained in a condensed manner. If the residents of earth’s middle section do bhuta shuddhi once at dawn, then they do not need to do any more purifying Kriya during the prangnatakal, meaning the time from when the sun is low in the east until midday, because there is no change in natural states at this time. Therefore, unless one makes oneself impure, no impurities will be born on their own. Because of the above-mentioned reason, if one does bhuta shuddhi at midday, then there is no need to do any purifying Kriya until dusk. In this way, if one does bhuta shuddhi once at dusk, then there is no need to do any purifying Kriya until midnight, meaning the time when the sun is low in the west. And if one does bhuta shuddhi once at midnight, then there is no need to do any type of purifying Kriya until dawn. Unless one makes oneself impure, there is no possibility of any kind of impurity arising on its own at this time. Thus, the yogis of the earth’s middle section have to do bhuta shuddhi four times a day. But for householders, the prescript is for Kriya at dawn, midday and dusk only. Kriya at midnight is not as imperative. The reason for this is that householders have to labor at many different kinds of work during the day and need more rest at night. Otherwise, it is possible that the body will become weak, giving rise to disease and making the mind depressed. And if at the time of complete rest one can have sound sleep, then no natural change can touch their minds. But, if there is not that much labor, or if the consciousness is at peace causing very little depletion from the body, and thus if it is not necessary to get as much rest, or if one for some reason is remains awake at night, then Kriya at midnight is also very necessary. Thus, if the householder life requires a good amount of labor and rest, one should perform bhuta shuddhi Kriya at the three transitional periods of dawn, midday and dusk every day. In this way, doing Kriya at the three transitional periods regularly every day, in a little more than a lunar month - in 34 days - and even if Kriya is not done one or two times because of important occasions or some events in householder life then in 36 days, one completes 100 bhuta shuddhi Kriyas. It has already been shown that the amount of evolution in the realization of Consciousness that would take 12 physical years can be accomplished by one bhuta shuddhi Kriya. Therefore, completing 100 [bhuta shuddhi] Kriyas in 36 days accomplishes the work of one Kali Yuga’s length of 1,200 years. Then the Dvapara yugavastha is attained and one can perceive the existence of the subtle body, the second aspect of Consciousness. In this way, the work of four yugas of Consciousness-realization that would normally take 12,000 years are accomplished by sadhakas in 360 days or one solar year, by which all four aspects of the beyond-creation Brahman-Consciousness is fully realized. Later, according to Sadguru’s instructions, by Omkar Kriya etc. one can realize the different luminous levels of Consciousness in 3 years or 39 lunar months, and thereafter accomplish the work of 12,000,000 years or one kalpa in 12 years, attaining Kaivalya, or seeing the Self as pervading all things of the Cosmos, and thus realizing Brahman. The saints have said that if sadhakas do not go astray in a wrong direction, even progressing in Kriya slowly can bring the attainment of Kaivalya or Brahman in 36 years, or 39 years if some occasions or events of householder life hinder progress. But diligent sadhakas can also complete this work and attain Kaivalya or Brahman at a high speed of even less than 12 years. Once sadhakas attain this all-pervading, all-powerful, all-knowing state, they have nothing in the Cosmos that they lack or that they want. If in this state one remains without doing Kriya, then ignorance and delusion gradually emerge again and cover up the revelation of Consciousness. This has been stated in the 24th sloka of the third chapter of this Srimad Bhagavad Gita. Therefore, even after the attainment of this Kaivalyavastha or Brahman, in order to preserve oneself, one must perform Kriya regularly. Now, if one can understand that one meaning of the word “yuga” is the condition of Satya, Treta etc., and that the other definition of the word is the way of attaining those conditions via yugal mantra, and if one can understand that it is for the reason of instructing in the two meanings that this word “yuga” is mentioned twice in this sloka, then it does not take long to understand the actual meaning of this sloka. Then the meaning becomes thus: destroying the evil tendencies in sadhakas, in order to establish dharma, meaning the revelation of Consciousness, by the practice of yugal mantra, meaning pranayam, by which, upon gradual attainment of the states of Satya, Treta etc., the Brahman-Consciousness fully reveals Itself. - 8-"

But sadhakas renounce the above-mentioned affinities, fear and anger, and remain one-pointedly in the Kutastha, discerning all these worldly enjoyments to be trivial; and by attaining Knowledge by the Consciousness-revealing Kriya, filled with Full-Consciousness, they are merged in Brahman-Consciousness. - 10-"

Consciousness is Eternal-Substance and is present the same in every place and condition. And neither is the Supreme Consciousness the Creator of these small sovereignties - it is only because of the fluctuations of the external dressing that make it seem as if the Consciousness is manifesting moore or less and thus giving emergence to the many different varnas. Just as the phantasmagoric shadow play [cinema] from the increase and decrease of light seems to cause many kinds of events, the light or lamp is not involved in any of the action and cannot be called as their creator - the many different, changing conditions of the covering in front of the light is making the events seem to happen - in the same way, although these varnas have come about because of the gradation of Consciousness-realization, that Eternal Consciousness is not their Creator.

Householders fulfill all matters present in a state of being free of like and dislike and without attachment to anything, and thereby they wear away prarabdha. Mentioning “grihashrami[s]” [resident[s] of the ashram of the home] immediately brings the worldly life to mind, but there are many differences between worldly life and grihashram[s] [home as ashram[s]]. Through evolution and the gradual revelation of prana and mind, the jiva progresses into plants, animals, birds and many such forms. Then, when the power of intellect is realized, it transforms into the form of a human being. Until this [human] state finds refuge, up to that time it takes birth again and again due to the intellect-generated prarabdha of many kinds causing the need to fulfill desires, and according to the fluctuations of mind in oneself, the jiva is bound to the manifestations of those tendencies as laughter, tears, running around etc. by which it is ever anxiously engrossed in passing life in this way, eventually ending in the jaws of time. Some think of themselves as worthless and are engaged in satisfying others such as wife, children etc., whom they believe to have power over them. Some think themselves to be the ones with power and become greatly involved in showing themselves off. Some see themselves as kings and rulers and spend time in war and strife. Some think of themselves as clever ministers of government and pass their lives in mental pursuits in order to rule the world-Brahmanda. But the strange thing is that throughout time, those who wear the outfits of lordship never take a look at themselves. That I am floating in the current of prarabdha, that I have no place to stand, that if this body is destroyed right now, who knows what will happen to this costume and power and who knows where prarabdha will take one and throw one into who knows what kind of great convolution - not even once do they look at all these things. Thus, because of this kind of lack of self-examination causing one to exist in a state of being without a spiritual home and thereby being always engaged in work towards others, the scriptural scholars have called this condition “nirashraya” [without refuge]. Once observation falls upon oneself, the jivas look to take refuge in order to be rescued from this ocean of prarabdha. These shelters - ashrams - are of four types: brahmacharyashram, grihasthashram, banaprasthashram and sannyasashram. In times past, care would be taken to start the son of a householder in the practice of brahmacharya once the age of seven had passed. If the child was well-mannered, calm, good at studies, and able to leave his mother and father to live in an acharyashram, then he would be enrolled in an acharyashram. A sacred thread was given to the children at the time of leaving for the acharayashram, signifying their purity. This sacred-thread ceremony is called “upanayan.” Living in an ashram such as this, children would study the Brahman-Knowledge-illuminating Vedas etc. according to the instructions of the acharya, and would spend the days in the discipline of brahmacharya with its various edicts and formalities. Not to speak of the company of women or of blindly ignorant sudras, there was no chance of even seeing them. This is called “brahmacharyashram.” The eighth year was understood to be the best time for a child to attain “brahminness.” Even the ages of up to nine or ten years were considered suitable for children to receive the education of brahmins. But if the tenth year had passed and upanayan was performed on the eleventh year, the acharyas would not teach that child the Vedas and such scriptures; instead, the education appropriate for kshatriyas - the political, governmental and military education - was given for the sustenance of livelihood. If the eleventh year had passed and upanayan was performed on the twelfth year, then instead of teaching the child the subtle and intricate intellectual matters of governmental work, the education appropriate for vaishyas - commerce and trade - was given for the sustenance of livelihood. But if the child had not been enrolled in an acharyashram within the twelfth year, then the maturation of sperm would cause the senses to become restless and the child would become devoid of patience, and therefore it would not be possible for the to acquire knowledge. This is called “the death of Savitri,” and because of this, one would not be accepted in an acharyashram once the twelfth year had passed. As in - garbhadharnadashtame janmato va, moujibandhah sashyate brahmananam rajanyanamnuynamekadashehabde vaishyanantu dvadashehabde vadanti The eighth year from the day of birth is the suitable time for upanayan for brahmins, meaning the suitable time for the child to have the upanayan ceremony in order to acquire brahminness - the eleventh year for kshatriyas and the twelfth year for vaishyas. In this way, according to individual capacity - some in three years, some in twelve - children would gain knowledge from the acharya and become fit to live in a disciplined, steadfast and desireless way in the temptation-filled society, and understanding that by living with and taking care of mother, father and relations, and leading the happy, married life of a householder, the jiva could wear away prarabdha and attain peace very easily, they would once again return home. This is called “samavartan.” Thus, having acquired special knowledge as to one’s personal vocation, the youth would take up the making of a livelihood and the work of a householder while practicing the guru-instructed methods such as “sandhya vandana.” Those who wear away their prarabdha in this way by fulfilling the matters of desire while being engaged in the work of the householder are called “grihasthashrami[s].” Thus, the twice-born would leave the brahmacharyashram, marry at the age of twenty-four and have a child by the age of twenty-five. The child would be raised and educated, and would go through the upanayan ceremony. And when the child was ready after having been trained in a brahmacharyashram, the man would oversee his son’s marriage in his son’s twenty-fourth year and would stay one more year to see the birth of his grandson, after which, at around the man’s fiftieth year, he would renounce the household and leave to live in the forest. This is called “banaprastha ashram.” In this way of life, people would often leave the jungle in search of a Sadguru and travel from pilgrimage to pilgrimage. Then, if they were able to obtain the grace of some saint, they would renounce all restlessness and try to establish themselves in Atman-Consciousness. This is what is called “sannyasashram.” People in this ashram completely renounce the body, senses, prana-substances and all fluctuations of consciousness, and thus attaining Supreme Tranquility, they merge with the Brahman-Substance. Those who would not have had the upanayan service done for them would be work as ignorant sudras in the service of the three varnas of brahmins, kshatriyas and vaishyas. Then, if a son or daughter of the family or such someone would be able to take over the householder duties, they would also for the sake of their own liberation seek out the refuge of some saint and go on pilgrimages; and when the Unseen would be pleased and they would receive the grace of some saint, by performing many kinds of yogakriyas, they would control their minds, and upon achieving that, they would merge with that Supreme Brahman-Substance. The “grihasthashram” that was mentioned previously is not the worldly life. This ashram is the second type of the four types of ashrams. It is in the refuge of this that jivas are able to live in great happiness and complete the fulfillment of the terrible prarabdha and thus ascend to Supreme Tranquility. This is the highly excellent path to take for the elimination of prarabdha. - 26-"

This has been mentioned in the yogashastras as “kevali pranayam.” By this, the movement of prana and apana stops naturally and on its own, stilling the mind and all prana, manifesting eternal happiness and illuminating the lamp of Knowledge. When the mind and prana are still in this way, the inhalation and exhalation of the physical airs, speech, body, sight - all of these things - also become still. One can ascertain the level of consciousness-absorption by these physical signs. This matter is written about in the yogic scriptures. As in - yatha yatha sadabhyasanmanasah sthirata bhavet vayu, vakkaya drishtinam sthiratashcha tatha tatha Extinguishing all such internal and external restlessness and attaining stillness, all hindrances and problems disappear within, and the eternal happiness of consciousness is manifested; and by the revelation of all awareness, the knowledge of discrimination is brilliantly illuminated. Some sadhakas practice disciplines regarding food and they merge the pranic faculties into each other by that practice. These matters of food are particularly expounded upon in the yogic scriptures. Here, one or two of the things about this written in the Mahabharata as part of a conversion with Bhisma is shown below. As in - kanam takshaneyuktah pinyakasya cha bharata snehanam varjaneyukto yogi balamavapnuyat bhunjanoyavakam ruksham dirghakalamarindam ekaharo vishuddhatma yogibalamavapnuyat panchan masan ritumshchaiva samyatsavanahastatha apah pitva payomishram yogibalamavapnuyat Putting aside oily/fatty food that may be dear, for the sake of purification at the end of the day, yogis gain yogic power by eating ground cereal in a paste. Yogis also gain yogic power by drinking milk mixed with water every day for one fortnight, one month, one season - meaning two months - or one year. Although every sadhaka does not have to follow the rules of eating in the manner mentioned above, still, everyone who wishes to practice the Consciousness-revealing Kriya must use temperance in food - become “mitahari[s]” - in order to eliminate impurities in the mind. Just a little bit of negligence in this causes the appearance of many kinds of diseases and negativity in the mind, by which Consciousness becomes covered up and one falls from practicing Kriya. This has been specifically stated in yogic scriptures. As in - mitaharam vinayastu yogarambhancha karayet nanaroga bhavettasya kinchidyoga na siddhati Many types of ailments arise in the yogi who performs any kind of yogakriya without being a mitahari, and none of his work is successful. Now, the teaching in regards to the matter of mitahar [eating temperately] as given in yogic scriptures is expressed below. As in - annena purayetardham toyena tu turiyakam udarasya turiyam samrakshayet vayuchalane shuddham sumadhuram snigdam udaradhvana varjjitam bhujyate surasam pritya mitaharamimam viduh Food such as rice should occupy half of the stomach (medham havishyamityuktam prashastam sattvikam laghu), meaning sacredly prepared sattvic and light substances; one-fourth of the space should be for liquids, and one-fourth should be empty so that air may breathe. The food to eat should be pure, tasty, sweet, gentle and by which air does not spread in the belly, and should be eaten in a peaceful state of mind. This is called mitahar. The previously mentioned Kriyavan sadhakas of all types destroy all tendencies of self-ruin by the path of Kriya as directed by their individual Gurus, and attaining nectarous Tranquility at the end of Kriya, they remain absorbed in the Eternal Universal Brahman-Substance. But the persons without Kriya - not to speak of the afterworld, meaning the Greatest Infinite Spiritual Happiness of the Bliss of Brahman - are not even able to obtain the little happiness of the human world, meaning that they are not able to have happiness in the matters of the body. In the Patanjal philosophical treatises this subject is written about in this way, as in - yogashchitta vritti nirodhah - no. 2 tadadrashtu svarupehavasthanam - no. 3 vritti svarupyamitaratra - no. 4 - Sadhanapada The ending of the fluctuations of consciousness is what is called “yoga.” By this, sadhakas residing in its still and tranquil state are able to clearly and deeply know the nature of all things in the world. In other cases, human beings become tremendously involved in the manifestations of the fluctuations caused by restlessness. The fulfillment of prarabdha, meaning the fulfillment of desires associated with the fluctuations, meaning that if the fluctuations are of an unpleasant nature, then immediately despondency sets in and one becomes filled with anxiety and sorrow; and when those matters of fulfillment are of a pleasant nature then a great attraction comes and all those prarabdha karmas are enjoyed through dancing, laughter etc., and one is not even aware of how it is happening. And one does not understand all of the changes that are taking place because of partaking in those things; one only is totally involved in the indulgence of physical enjoyments like an animal. The significant thing here is that because lower life-forms do not possess the power of intellect, they steadily evolve into higher and higher states according to natural law. But these people go beyond natural law by the use of intellect; some evolve higher, and some fall and again have take to take the forms of insects etc. For them nothing is stable. - 29, 30 and 31-"

It is present the same everywhere.  This idea of the manifestation of Consciousness as being more in one place and less in another is not created by Consciousness; this idea exists because of ignorance.  In this way, all karma is of ignorance, and understanding that Atman-Consciousness is completely uninvolved in that [karma], the sages of the past attained liberation.  Therefore, one should desirelessly remain unattached from all types of karma.  Among karma [action], some should be done and some should not be done - the understanding of this and the way of residing in non-attached tranquility from all karma - the secrets of these are veery difficult to know.  Even very great and knowledgeable beings are unable to comprehend these things.  Therefore, instead of relying upon ordinary intellect, one should discern among these things from a state of mind that is completely controlled and focused.  The one who knows heat and cold or success and failure to be the same, who is not a slave to any senses of the body, who has renounced all cravings and is satisfied with whatever comes effortlessly, who works to simply maintain the workings of the body with disciplined mind, desirelessly and without confusion and doubt, all of this person’s work is devoid of the bindings of future results and [his work] is transformed into “akarma” [non-action].  And the one with akarma, meaning the one with the purpose of having no attachment to results of any karma, who takes up yogakriya in the Kutastha with disciplined and focused mind, is the truly intelligent being.  Even while engaged in all types of work, he remains in samadhi of the Consciousness of the Self.  The seers of Oneness know this world-Brahmanda to be completely filled with Brahman, and thus, they practice experiencing Him in all types of work.  Hatha yogis practice the control of the senses by certain techniques.  Jnana yogis surrender every karma to Kutasthachaitanya and try to live in non-attached tranquility.  Brahmacharis try to pacify the senses by pratyahara [withdrawal] etc.  Those disciplined in meditation practice the surrender of the work of all senses and even the workings of prana itself to Kutasthachaitanya.  Asectics take extreme vows and by the use of medication and difficult practices, try to steady the body, and by certain yogic practices and studying scriptures of liberation, they try to illuminate knowledge within themselves.  Other yogis practice the stillness of knowledge by rechak and purak of pranayam, stopping the movement of prana and apana.  And some others try to extinguish the outgoing faculties by disciplined eating.  The fruits of all of these yogic practices can be successfully attained by Kriya, and when Knowledge is illuminated by this, all kriyas [methods] are finished.  After reverently serving and asking questions regarding these things to the wise ones of Self-Knowledge, when one receives the answers and practices accordingly, one can no longer be stupefied by maya.  By this, sadhakas become free of everything and sinless, aware of all things in the Universe within themselves, and finally seeing themselves as the Infinite Consciousness, they attain the Infinite Bliss of the Brahman-Substance.  But those without Kriya are not able to be successful in acquiring even the happiness of the physical world, far be it to speak of the spiritual Bliss of Brahman.  There is nothing more pure and higher than Knowledge in this world; this Knowledge of the Self is revealed by yogakriya.  Just as the blaze of a fire burns dry wood all into ashes, in the same way this Knowledge burns the seeds - rendering them fruitless for the future - of all karma of even the worst of sinners, and thus liberating them from the ocean of samsara.  The reverent, one-pointed and disciplined sadhakas in yogakriya gain Knowledge and attain liberation, and all work of the ignorant ones practicing yogakriya with irreverence or with doubt become corrupted.  The apprehensive ones engaged in doubt have to remain bound to all kinds of physical, subtle and other kinds of ordinary pleasures.  With the sword of Sadguru-initiated Knowledge cutting apart all doubt in the heart, and residing non-attached and contentedly in Atman-Consciousness through the performance of yogakriya, jivas can become liberated from all karma.  Therefore, one should abandon all laziness and, with a mind that is free of doubt, perform this yogakriya. Thus ends the fourth chapter of the yogashastra upanishad Srimad Bhagavad Gita with analysis via various scriptures of this country and the West, along with spiritual commentary."
