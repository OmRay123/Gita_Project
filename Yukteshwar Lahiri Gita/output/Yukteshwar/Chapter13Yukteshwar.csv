In the published Bengali print, there seems to have been a printing error and the word “upadeshta” is written in the commentary part, even though that is not the word in the sloka.

This translation presents slokas 13:25 through 13:27 in the manner where the alignment has been adjusted according to the aforementioned discernment of the translator. If this is a mistake, then the translator takes full responsibility for it.] Some by Samkhya - meaning see Him via jnana yoga, whose work is Yonimudra. - 25-"
