To understand this, it is necessary to explain what is “Pranava”; that is being elucidated below. OM - this sound is called “Pranava.” “A” + “U “+ “M” - the union of these three sounds comprise this word. “A” means Brahma,* “U” means Vishnu, “M” means Maheshvara. “A” + “U” = “O” and the “chandrabindu” (a phonetic symbol drawn as a crescent with a dot above it - see the OM symbol) takes the place of “M” to represent the nasal sound; as when - “bangsha” [bamboo] becomes “ba(n)sh,” “hangsa” [swan] becomes “ha(n)s” etc.** [The “OM” sound is not written in Sanskritic languages with an “M”, but the above-mentioned “chandrabindu” - as it is in the Bengali text in this Gita as well - and is often pronounced as “ONG”, where the “G” is never completed.] Thus, the union of Vishnu, Brahma and Maheshvara is the meaning of this OM sound. Now, what this aggregate of Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshvar is, and what the condition is when they are one - that needs to somewhat be expounded upon. [*In the sections marked “Poetically” and “Commentary” in this translation, “Brahma” always means the Creator aspect of the Trinity [Creator, Sustainer, Destroyer], and “Brahman” always means the Supreme Absolute, which is beyond all and is the Source of the Trinity. In many translations, the transliteration “Brahma” is used to represent both the Absolute as well as the Creator aspect, the two being distinguished from each other by phonetic marks representing a short “a” in the end of the word for the Absolute, and a long “a” at the end of the word for the Creator aspect. Not using phonetic markings in the English parts of this translation, the traditional unmarked transliterations for those two words have been used, as explained above in this footnote. The Sanskrit slokas, however, have been transliterated without consideration of such distinctions. **The “n”s in parentheses are not pronounced as consonants. They indicate a slightly overt nasal sound.] In the first sloka of the first chapter of this book it has been explained that in this creation, Consciousness (Spirit) is referred to by these eight names: Vishva, Birat, Taijas, Hiranyagarbha, Prajna, Ishvar, Chidabhas and Kutasthachaitanya. In them, the first six mentioned are presiding in the functions of action, and the last two mentioned are existing as two types of revelatory aspects. Among the first six states of Consciousness, Vishva and Birat - meaning the tamas-dominated ones - are existing as the physical form of Consciousness, which, because of their nature to transform/destroy, are constantly changing. The one who has been referred to as the Lord of Destruction/Transformation, or Maheshvar, in the commentary to the eighth sloka of the fourth chapter - that destruction aspect of Consciousness is called “adhibhut.” Taijas and Hiranyagarbha - meaning the rajas-dominated oness - are the subtle aspects of Consciousness presiding within all physical elements. That which has been called the Lord of Creation, or Brahma - that is who is the being within the abode of physical creation, and is called the creation-causing, demi-god-energy endowed “adhidaiva.” And Prajna and Ishvar - meaning the sattva-dominated - are the aspects of Consciousness presiding in causal form - the one who has been referred Vishnu, the sustainer/holder of the world. Being self-revealed, he is the one who is called “adhyatma.” By the practice of Sadguru-instructed Kriya and by the study of the matters of Self, with mind completely focused, sadhakas gradually come to know their own physical bodies to be the aggregate of the Cosmos, or Birat - meaning the “adhibhut” Mahaeshvar; having done so, they experience the form of the subtle body within that [the physical body] - Taijas’s sum total form of Hiranyagarbha - meaning Brahma, that “adhidaiva” by whom all physical aspects of creation are appearing; after which, sadhakas experience its [the physical and subtle aspects’] sustainer/holder - the causal body’s sum total, known as Ishvar-consciousness. That Ishvar-consciousness is manifesting all aspects of both the physical and subtle aspects of creation. In this state, sadhakas experience the aforementioned “Pranava” with complete clarity. For this reason, this [Pranava] is call “Ishvar-vachak” [the Word pertaining to Ishvar]. For the sake of explanation, this is what the saintly scriptural scholars have described as the simultaneously arising OM Pranava sound as the united condition of the aforementioned Brahma-, Vishnu- and Maheshvar-knowing three letters of A, U, M. The highest purpose of Pranava, because mind comes near to the Lord by its experience, is “Ishvarpranidhan” [meditating on Ishvar]. By it, the subconscious becomes exposed, all obstacles are destroyed, and mind easily becomes absorbed in the Divine. For this reason, it is this subconscious-exposing Omkar Sound, or Pranava, that they call the Religion of the Self [“atmadharma”]. This state is the highest. If one can abide in this state, then nothing remains unknown in creation - physical, subtle, etc., and even when Brahma and all the others are destroyed in the time of dissolution, this state never ends. As in Patanjal - ishvara pranidhanadva - no. 23 tasya vachakah pranavah - no. 23 tajjapastadarthabhavanam - no. 28 tatah pratyakchetanadhigamohpantarayabhavashcha - no. 29 tatraniratishayam sarvajnabijam - no. 25 sa esha purveshamapi guruh kalenanavacchedat - no. 26 ity samadhipadah Thus, this creation is existing due to the conglomeration of adhibhut, adhidaiva and adhyatma, and only by the Atman-Kriya Pranava is the Essence of Consciousness manifest in the elements. But none of the above-mentioned in creation is self-manifesting; therefore, even Pranava is not self-revealing, and neither is the Essence of Consciousness manifesting in all elements by it. Chidabhas and Kutasthachaitanya are present in creation to reveal all of them; this has already been previously explained. In that, the Abhaschaitanya [Chidabhas] is only the reflection of Kutasthachaitanya; this has been explained in the first sloka of the first chapter. Therefore, only Kutasthachaitanya is the revealer of all creation, and thereby also the revealer of the Atman-Kriya Pranava. By the Sadguru-graced techniques, taking recourse in Kutasthachaitanya Itself, gradually becoming purified, and realizing Pranava, sadhakas experience the entire adhibhautik [physical essence], adhidaivik [subtle essence] and adhyatmik [causal essence] comprised creation. It is this Kutasthachaitanya that is every yajna, meaning the Lord of the Consciousness-revealing Kriya; it is by taking recourse in This and by This, being engaged in Kriya, that sadhakas experience the whole of creation as revealed within themselves. It this Kutasthachaitanya that is present as the Supreme in all creation, and therefore also in the bodies of the embodied. That Boundless, Infinite Consciousness Who is Above All, and is gracefully abiding as Immutable and Eternal - That is what is known as Brahman. -3 and 4-"

This subject has been explained in the 70th sloka of the second chapter. For this reason, one who, having stopped all fluctuations of mind, abides in Atman Consciousness - he, even though he discards the unreliable body, because there are no causes of permutation of creation left, attains with certainty that all-pervading Infinite Consciousness-Beingness. There is not a bit of doubt about that. - 5 and 6-"

Now, the significance of this sloka is this: those who, in the above-mentioned way by the Grace of Sadguru, have gone beyond the Wheel of Maya and completed one kalpa - meaning the Kriya of one day of Brahma - in their own elemental bodies, and thereby experienced the dissolution of each one’s mana, buddhi, chitta and ahamkar, and then inverting it, have been able to be again present in a body-form - they are the ones that the saintly scriptural scholars call “ahoratrajna” [knower of “aho ratri”]. - 17-"

It is at that time that Brahman-realized sadhakas discard their bodies and become the Beingness of Infinite Consciousness. All those sadhakas who, being attached to the fulfillment of desire, have been unable to dissolve the aggregate of elements and thus have been unable to realize Atman-Consciousness - they become covered with the darkness of illusion, and at the time of leaving the body, unconsciously descend through the six chakras, because of which thoughts of sense-objects arise, and they again take birth in samsara. - 24 and 25-"

And in what way do they exist in this body? And how do sadhakas with absorbed minds, filled with the total realization of Brahman, leave their bodies? [1 - 2] Answering that, this type of experience happens in the Kutasthachaitanya of sadhakas: The Imperishable Infinite Consciousness which is beyond creation is what is known as Brahman; and within creation, His causal-body-based life-element without permutation is adhayatma; the ever-transforming form of this Cosmos is His physical essence adhibut; and His inner-residing, Lord of creation form as the subtle essence is called adhidaiva. The sum total of this phenomena, rising out of the Consciousness-Being - the Omkar Sound - is the only Self-Kriya; and the One, taking Whose recourse brings about the emergence of that Omkar Sound - that Kutasthachaitanya is the One Who is adhiyajna. He abides in this Cosmos as the Highest of All [3 - 4]. At the time oof leaving the body, the thoughts that become established in the mind of the jiva because of the united power of many types of samskaras - attached to and according to that conglomeration, the jiva takes birth in samsara. Therefore, if Brahman-realization is established at that time, then Brahman-ness is what is attained. There is absolutely no uncertainty about this. Therefore, one should always remain in Kriya with mind surrendered in Kutasthachaitanya [5 - 7]. The one who, by yogic practice, with devoted heart and by the Sadguru-bestowed method, holds prana between the eyebrows and abides in that Omniscient, Ruler of All, Lord of the Universe, beyond the buddhi and even the supremely subtle Prakriti, the Supreme, Beginningless, Perfect, Self-Revealed Infinite Consciousness, and leaves his body thus - he becomes Brahman [8 - 10]. The practitioners who are devoid of affinity etc., withdraw their senses, still the fluctuations of mind, merge prana into the Brahmarandhra with certain dharana methods, and by constantly meditating on the all-Cosmos-pervading, sum total of the physical, subtle, causal phenomena, the Ishwar-Consciousness Word of OM - they leave their bodies and attain that Abode of Kaivalya, the Immutable subject spoken of by the realized ones [11 - 13]. Even after attaining Brahmaloka, because of Supreme Contentment being still unsatisfied, such jivas again and again take birth in creation; but the sadhakas who with one-pointed mind remain engrossed in the meditation of Atman-Consciousness and thus attain that Beingness of Eternal Consciousness - they never again have to return to this samsara, the abode of sorrow [14 - 16]. The Cosmos manifests for millions of years in the day of Brahma and for millions of years it remains in a dissolved state in the Inexpressible Nature during the night of Brahma. The sadhakas who, having crossed over the Wheel of Maya through the sacrament of Sadguru and with one-pointed devotion, have experienced that All-pervading Supreme Substance of Atman Consciousness - the One Who is Immutable throughout the repeated creation and destruction of the phenomenal aggregate, and the Sustainer of the entire Cosmos - they never again have to become slaves to creation [17 - 22]. Because they are deluded with the fulfillment of desire, inferior jivas are unconscious, due to which they become attached to sense-objects and thereby have to come back to samsara; and elevated sadhakas, because they remain in the Fiery and Powerful, Radiantly Effulgent, Self-Revealed Atman Consciousness, they fully satisfy all sensory desire and having no need to come back to samsara, they abide in the Indestructible Peace. These two types of good and evil ways are always present in the world [23 - 26]. The little bit of joy that is obtained through the study of the Vedas, yajna, austere penance, charity etc. - because sadhakas by the Sadguru-graced method reside in that Atman Consciousness - the abode of the totality of all those joys, nothing is able to delude them [27 - 28]. Thus ends the eighth chapter of the yogashastra upanishad Srimad Bhagavad Gita with analysis via various scriptures of this country and the West, along with spiritual commentary."
