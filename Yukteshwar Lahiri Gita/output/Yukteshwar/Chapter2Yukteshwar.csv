Tattva, meaning karan (cause) -   sattva (neutral), raja (positive) and tama (negative) -   these three gunas working together are called Trigunamayi Prakrriti.  The gunas themselves are the cause of creation.  As in - sattvarajastamasam samyavastha prakritih prakritermahan mahato ityadi -   K. Su. - 1:61 It is written in the Patanjal philosophical treatises that the three gunas mentioned above, the five elements and the eleven sensory faculties form the scenery of purush or jivachaitanya.  The jiva enjoys objects through these and when awareness manifests about their behavior, it is also by these that liberation is attained.  Among the above-mentioned three gunas, the sattva guna is tranquil and still in an awakened state, while the tama guna is inert with stupor.  Only the rajoguna is ever-moving, meaning operative.  As in - prakashkriyasthitishilam bhutendriatmakam bhogapavargartham drishyam -   Sadhanapada - no. 18 The above-mentioned raja guna being the one with the capacity for action, is mixed with the sattva guna and tama guna giving rise to two different forms - rajasik sattva and rajasik tama.  By the Guru-instructed Kriya, in the Kutasthachaitanya the sadhakas experience the gunas of Nature as these five types.  As in - darpane samalokya tatra shvasam vinikshipet -   Svarodaya “Darpan” (drp-un)[mirror]:  that by which the forms of all things are illuminated, meaning that by which things are reflected.  With the exception of physical objects, what is ordinarily called “darpan” does not reflect mind, intellect or any such internal things.  For this reason, that darpan is only a model and does not convey the complete function of darpan.  It has been touched upon previously and it is also written in every other scripture that this body is the place of all pilgrimages, the place of all gods, and all knowledge is present in it.  One becomes aware of this through the teachings of Guru.  As in - dehasthah sarvavidyashcha dehasthah sarvadevatah dehasthani cha tirthani guruvakyena labhyate Thus, in this body itself there is a place where by the experience of Kutasthachaitanya the physical, subtle and the subtlest of subtle qualities of Nature are experienced.  The scriptural scholars have stated this as the true darpan.  Because Kutasthachaitanya is experienced here, this is also called “Kutastha.” kutasthe kalpita buddhistatrachitprativimbakam -   Panchadashi The saints knowledgeable in yogic scriptures have referred to the above-mentioned five types of states which represent the cause of Nature as the five elements.  In the clear mind of the field of Pandu - the sushumna - these five elements are experienced in their pure states.  This is why the Mahabharata has called these the five Pandavas, the doubt-ridden and blind mind Dhritarashtra, and the different types of quintelemental and sensory internal faculties and elements as the sons of Dhritarashtra.   The five elements:  earth, water, fire, air and either are referred to as places of emergence (cause) and these five are mentioned as “earth-element,” “water-element,” “fire-element,” “air-element” and “space-element.”  All of these elements are always dutifully abiding in the whole of human nature and exists in it inextricably.  Sadhakas can become aware of this through the practice of Guru-instructed Kriya.  If one is able to be aware of this, then no other instruments or mechanisms are necessary to help one know things.  Without being aware of this, astrological work cannot be carried out correctly.  There is a saying by Mahadeva about this subject:  astrology without awareness of svara - meaning the five elements along with the substance of breath - is like a house without a lord, a speaker without wisdom and a body without nerves, and it fails.  As in - svarahinohadha daivajno nathadinam yatha griham shastrahino yatha vakta shirohinancha yadvapuh Through the experience of these elements, past, future, present - all can be known exactly.  With this no other astrological treatises are necessary.  This is why the great sages of Vedic times ascertained that it was impossible to attain wisdom through books.  Cultivating the Practice of Brahman by the sadhana of Sadguru-given Kriya, they attained the all-containing Knowledge of Brahman and acquiring omniscience, they had this Infinite Universe as if in the palms of their hands.  Therefore nothing remained unknown to them.  Because of the emergence and the disappearance of the above-mentioned five elements, the arising of the many different substances with different qualities establishing themselves in the subtle body (electric body) and working in the physical body (material body) as the perceptional and experiential powers of mind along with physical matter, many types of things happen in relation to us in greater or lesser ways.  I will give a description below about how the above-mentioned elements are experienced. During the emergence of the earth element, without touching either side of the nose, breath flows exactly through the middle in 12 finger-lengths.  A honey-liquid is experienced in the throat, giving birth to an addiction to the honey-liquid.  The feeling of yellow forms rises in the mind and a desire to see yellow forms is born.  A four-sided yellow form appears in the Kutastha.  In a pure state, human nature remains in this condition for 50 pala, meaning 20 minutes. During the emergence of the water element, breath flows through the lower part of the nose in 16 finger-lengths.  An astringent-liquid is experienced in the throat giving birth to an addiction to the astringent-liquid.  The feeling of white forms arises in the mind and a desire to see white forms is born.  A white half-moon form appears in the Kutastha.  In a pure state, human nature stays in this condition for 40 pala, meaning 16 minutes. During the emergence of the fire element, breath flows through the upper part of the nose in 4 finger-lengths.  A bitter-liquid is experienced in the throat, giving birth to an addiction to the bitter-liquid.  The feeling of red forms arises in the mind and a desire to see red forms is born.  A red triangle appears in the Kutastha.  In a pure state, human nature remains in this condition for 30 pala, meaning 12 minutes. At the time of the air element, breath flows through the side of the nose in 8 finger-lengths.  A tart-liquid is experienced in the throat giving birth to an addiction to the tart-liquid.  The feeling of blue forms arises in the mind and a desire to see blue forms is born.  A blue circular form appears in the Kutastha.  In a pure state, human nature remains in this condition for 20 pala, meaning for 8 minutes. At the time of the space element, breath flows through the nose without any force/pressure.  A pungent-liquid is experienced in the throat giving birth to an addiction to the pungent-liquid.  The feeling of dark purple forms arises in the mind and a desire to see dark purple forms is born.  In the dark purple of the Kutastha, many kinds of forms appear like points.  In a pure state, human nature remains in this condition for 10 pala, or 4 minutes. One equally sees the above-mentioned elements, the divine consciousness presiding in the main nadis, and the Kutasthachaitanya all as eternal substances, meaning not created by the world and not destroyed even at the time of total dissolution. - 12-"

In previous slokas, it was stated that because of the emergence of anger from desire, the jiva becomes as if dead, enveloped in the stupor of ignorance.  Therefore, one should cut the root of this desire.  Then it was stated in this sloka [70] that partaking without desire will liberate one from this material enchainment.  There is a possibility of misunderstanding these statements.  Therefore, it is appropriate to explain what type of thing this desire is. The matters of the three gunas of Prakriti - the cause of creation - were spoken about in the twelfth sloka of this chapter.  The sadhakas using the operative power of rajoguna, experience these in five forms, and scriptural scholars have called each of the residing places of the five subtle elements, meaning substance (cause) - earth-element, water-element, fire-element, air-element and ether-element, and they have also said that all three gunas - sattva (neuter), raja (positive) and tama (negative) - are magnetized to those subtle elements present in Nature. It is written in the Vedanta shastras that all organs of perception (sensory organs) in the Universe were created from the experiential part (sentient part) of those great elements’ aspect of sattva guna, and the five types of sattva guna respective to the elements from those organs of perception brought about the all-experiencing, meaning all-knowing (omniscient), mind.  And the operative aspect - the rajoguna aspect - of all of those great elements created the organs of action (motor organs), and the conglomeration of the rajoguna aspects of those five elements from all of the organs of action brought about the creation of the all-powerful (almighty) prana (magnetism or vital fluid).  And the inert tamoguna aspect of those great elements, mixing with together created the scenery of this Universe in its physical form. If Prakriti were not filled with these three gunas, then none of these substances would manifest.  Because Prakriti is the root cause of this creation, It is called the causal body of Brahmanda [Universe in all levels].  From the great elements, sattva and raja guna-manifested prana and other subtle substances comprise what is called the subtle body; and the tamoguna-manifested visible, material and form-oriented scenery of planets and satellites and the entire physical world comprise what is called the material body.  It is the subtle body that is operating the entirety of atoms and sub-atoms etc. necessary for the creation, preservation and destruction of all planets, satellites and solar worlds. All of manifested creation is a part of this immense Brahmanda.  Therefore, all three bodies, material, subtle and causal, are present in everything, some parts evident and some parts hidden.  With the erosion of impurities, all of these bodies, and eventually five levels, are revealed.  Because of this the Vedanta scholars have called this Universe “panchakoshamaya” [with five covers].  Fearing excessiveness, I am unable to elucidate about these in detail here.  But it is important to say this much:  that the human body is also a part of this Immense Brahmanda and all - mind, prana, senses and everything else - are present here in their highest forms. Because this all-pervading mind was born of the all-revealing and all-experiencing aggregate of the sattvic elements, it is omniscient.  When there is a lack perceived in the organs of perception, this completely immersed in sattva guna (neutralized) mind becomes desirous and slightly diverted which gives rise to sattva and rajoguna (polarized).  The way that, if in the midst of innumerable magnetic compasses, one magnet of sattva guna (neutralized magnet) becomes somehow influenced by raja or tamoguna (polarized), all of those innumerable magnetic compasses will in the sympathizing process become attracted to that and cause a corrupted condition, in the same way, when the sattva guna-filled mind becomes desirous, sensing lack in some sense, and gets slightly corrupted, it becomes attached to raja and tamoguna (polarized).  And by this, as the pranas become gradually attracted, this entire world and universe is under the force of prana.  This prana, being created from the operative quality of the collective rajoguna, is all-powerful.  Therefore, all things present in the Brahmanda are under its control.  Endowed with the above-mentioned force, this all-powerful prana, by the organs of action (motor fluid or organs of motion) makes possible the enjoyment of those corrupted things desired by the mind through the organs of perception (sensory fluid or organs of sense) and by thus satisfying the mind, returns it to its natural state. The organs of perception in this Immense Brahmanda (motor electricity) is experiencing everything by themselves and because no substance exists without them, they have no need for the enjoyment of anything.  Thus, the senses being satisfied in every way (in full satisfaction), the mind, which is born of them, resides in a still, undisturbed and unaffected state.  In this way, with the mind ever-remaining in its natural condition, prana does not get agitated and therefore, the organs of action dependent upon it remain ever-dormant.  Thus unhindered in any way, the prana of this Immense Brahmanda (universal magnetism vitality), in its all-powerful form (with almighty power), operates, like Its blood and guts, this Infinite Universe with its planets and satellites according to the course of natural law.  The Overlord Consciousness of this Immense Brahmanda is called by the scriptural scholars as Paramatman or Parampurush.  Being in the state of non-doing and tranquility, He is ruling over the world and Brahmanda by prana in the awakened condition.  The individualized parts of Him are called Jivatman or Purush. In the course of natural law, the jiva matures from knowing only its annamaya kosha [food covering] to the realization of the pranamaya kosha [prana covering], and, further within that, when it is able to realize the manomaya kosha [mind covering], impurity is gradually diminished and the jiva acquires many types of sub-human bodies, going progressively higher until the jnanamaya kosha [knowledge covering] is prevalent, which is when the jiva takes a human form.  When the jiva completes the fulfillment of body and mind with its senses through the miraculous power of yoga, having experienced all mind, prana, senses etc. of this Immense Brahmanda as its own body, the jiva realizes the anandamaya kosha [bliss covering].  In this way, one attains Parampurush or Paramatman. Having attained this wholeness, if at some moment it cannot experience the Universe, desires for enjoyment arise in the jiva’s mind, one after another.  Once the jiva’s mind moves from its natural state even a little, prana becomes attracted to that and calls forth the force of the all-powerful prana-airs - prana vayu - of this Brahmanda.  Thus, that corrupted substance which should be avoided appears in order to satisfy the craving of the jiva.  By partaking in those objects of desire, the jiva pacifies the mind or returns it to its natural state.  The mind being natural and peaceful, the jiva’s prana-vayu (vitality or animal magnetism) becomes completely without force, and having its full strength, meaning being its awakened state, continues to operate all things in their normal ways.  When one can keep his own prana in its awakened state, at the emergence of any desire in the mind, the object of that desire immediately appears in order to appease the jiva.  This omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent mind is so great that no thing and no power in this Universe can tolerate its unhappiness.  This Infinite Universe is waiting with extreme eagerness to satisfy the mind.  No matter what is necessary to fulfill the mind’s desires, even if the thing does not exist in the Brahmanda - it is immediately created to quell the mind’s craving.  In this way, this solar system/universe in the Infinite Universe is a servant of the jiva’s will power, and is existing to fulfill its desires and bring it peace. But, being small-minded and restless, one desire is immediately followed by another in the jiva’s mind and it is always perturbed and distorted.  Because of this, the prana-vayu’s force is working with many different objects and, not being able to apply its power into anything in a focused way, a very fragmented and scattered state manifests.  The prana-vayu cannot properly work with the prana of the Brahmanda in this corrupted condition, and because the force is being used for all kinds of conflicting thoughts, nothing is able to manifest.  And by this the body begins to not function properly and eventually becomes useless.  When the present body is destroyed, because the force of those numerous types of desires were not renounced, the jiva has to take another body appropriate to the aggregate power of those forces (resultant force).  Therefore, because of all of the accumulated desires, the jiva has to again take birth and be bound to this worldly life.  Thus, without their fulfillment, the jiva has no way out.  About this subject, it is written in Tantra that the good and bad karma of human beings, meaning the matters of desire, must be fulfilled.  There is no diminishing of this without fulfillment.  Until all of the these good and bad karmas are completely eliminated, the jiva has no possibility of peace or liberation. ma bhukta kshiyate karma kalpakoti shatairapi avashyameva bhoktavyam kritam karma shubhashubam yavanna kshiyate karma shubhanchashubhameva va tayanna jayate moksham nrinam kalpashatairapi All of these accumulated desires are what the scriptural scholars call “adrishta” [unseen fate]. For this reason, in order to renounce the desires of adrishta, it has been stated in the previous slokas that one should be detached from its roots of affection and dislike.  And in this sloka, because there is no other way than to fulfill the accumulated desires of adrishta, it has been taught that one should in an unaffected way, meaning without creating any new adrishta, return the mind to its natural state and make it tranquil by the fulfillment of the previously accumulated adrishta. When by yogakriya the foundation of desire - like and dislike - is extinguished, the revelation of Divinity fulfills all matters of desire, upon which the mind returns to its natural state and becomes tranquil.  And experiencing all mind, prana and senses of this Immense Brahmanda as one’s own body and pervading throughout the Universe, the jiva becomes the Total Consciousness of the Universe - Parampurush or Paramatman.  Thus, there being nothing else existing in the Universe other than the Self, the scriptural saints have called this attainment “Kaivalyapada.” - 70-"

therefore, to maintain this repulsive lordship, one should follow them birth after birth instead of destroying them.  Without them, our lives are meaningless [4 - 6].  As such, I cannot see anything that great or that wrong in performing or not performing Kriya.  I am unable to perceive; I am unable to do little harm for great gain; I have become powerless; I am unable to perform Kriya; I have no power of discrimination.  So, O Kutasthachaitanya, I take refuge in You.  Please teach me what is dutiful and what is not [7 - 9].  When this condition of openness occurs, Kutasthachaitanya is pleased and through inner perception, this type of unmanufactured truths are experienced [10].  Just as the physical body naturally goes through the manifestations of childhood, youth and old age, in the same way, the subtle body also naturally takes up another body after death.  But Consciousness is never destroyed, and that which is without a beginning is never born also.  The wise ones are never deluded by all these matters of birth and death.  Therefore, it is not right to just listen to clever sayings and become engaged in that.  Kriya should be taken up [11 - 13].  The one who is not distressed by the fleeting objects of pleasure and pain is the one who is qualified for the path of liberation.  Therefore, learning to endure these things is imperative [14 - 15].  This body and its faculties exist in appearance only; they remain only for a while and are impermanent.   The All-Pervading Consciousness is Eternal Substance; it is not destroyed by anything.  Therefore, one should destroy even this impermanent name along with the appearance of faculties and perform the Consciousness-revealing Kriya [16 - 18].  “This Causeless, Infinite, Eternal and ever-existing-as-Itself Atman is never destroyed with the body.  Only in ignorance is It perceived to be the slayer or the slain.”  Understanding this statement, no one endeavors to meaningless killing [19 - 21].  This Eternal, All-pervading, Universal Atman-substance cannot be corrupted by air, fire, water or weapons.  As if casting off worn-out clothing, He discards a body that no longer works and thereafter takes a new body.  Upon experiencing this Consciousness-substance, which is beyond the organs of perception, the organs of action and inner organs [mind], one should not grieve over the loss of these insignificant mental propensities etc. [22 - 25]  If one is deluded and ascertains that the Atman has birth and death, even then it is certain that if birth happens then there must be death, and if death happens then there must be birth.  It is not appropriate to lament over this unavoidable matter [26 -27].  This Eternal Consciousness cannot be killed.  From the unmanifest Nature of this Consciousness was this elemental world created, remaining in which - in the manifested state for a while - It merges back into Itself at the time of dissolution.  Therefore, why be sad over this?  When prajna is established by the Sadguru-graced Kriya, one is awed by experiencing all this; one is also at wonderment while speaking about this and listening to this, but unless the consciousness is stilled, it is not understandable, even upon hearing this over and over [28 - 30].  There is no other way for the embodied to be liberated besides this effortless Atman-dharma, by which one acquires the highest - the Bliss of Brahman [31 -32].  Turning away from this revelation of Consciousness causes doubt even in the existence of oneself and one falls into great delusion.  Then one becomes enslaved to the elemental world’s and the ego’s faculties and must go through great suffering [33 - 36].  But one acquires the Brahmanda with successful practice.  If one dies while practicing, then one dies without suffering and goes to the most excellent place as prescribed by the samskaras.  Therefore, gain and loss are the same.  Having such knowledge, one should endure impermanent pleasure and pain and be immersed in performing the Consciousness-revealing Kriya [37 - 38].  This is the jnanayoga of the wise ones.  It is imperative to do this yogakriya for the realization of this Knowledge.  The practice of this does not require all kinds of mental processes; self-discipline is enough.  Therefore, there is no possibility of any obstacles as well.  It is never unsuccessful.  Just a little performance of it destroys the suffering of the mind and brings contentment [39 - 41].  The Vedas and such treatises are filled with tempting methods to fulfill all kinds of desires based on sattva, raja and tama gunas.  Therefore, one should renounce the cravings for enjoyment, endure pleasure and pain, go beyond the three gunas, and reside in Tranquility, because those who are content in the Bliss of Brahman have no lack of happiness [42 - 46].  Therefore, yogakriya is the highest karma, not the trivial, result-hankering Vedic acts.  One should in no case disregard the practice of this [yogakriya].  No one has control over the result of any action; thus one should not be anxious over that.  Therefore, one should know success and failure as the same and be immersed in Kriya [47 - 49].  By knowing the method of this yogakriya, sages extinguish the perception of both good and wrong acts, liberate themselves from the bindings of this worldly life and attain Kaivalyapada [50 - 51].  The mind is captivated by many religious and secular matters.  When one goes beyond this fort of delusion, a non-attachment about all things manifests and a tranquil prajna is realized [52 - 53].  Upon having this experience, a certain enquiry arises in the rajoguna that:  who are called sthitaprajna; how do they teach; how do they reside; and how do they move? [54]  Then it is experienced in the Kutasthachaitanya that - withdrawing the senses as a tortoise pulls in its limbs, being without fear and anger, discerning happiness and unhappinesss as the same, being without desires of the mind and without affection or dislike for anything, and remaining content within oneself - are the signs of sthitaprajna [55 -58].  It is true that by fasting the senses become listless and turn away from sense pleasures, but the cravings do not end.  This is proved when the senses return to their healthy states and again capture the minds of even the most careful and highly knowledgeable ones.  Therefore, one should completely control the juggernaut of senses and reside in the Self.  This is the teaching of the ones with sthitaprajna [59 - 61].  Thinking about sense objects causes a liking for them which leads to obsession with having them.  At the lack of such things, anger arises which gives birth to delusion.  Delusion destroys memory and it prevents self-knowledge which makes one as if dead.  There is no possibility of tranquility without the revelation of Knowledge by yogakriya, and without tranquility happiness is difficult to attain.  When the senses are restless from thinking about sense objects, the mind follows them, and is like a boat at the mercy of winds on the sea, and thus wisdom is lost.  For this reason the ones with sthitaprajna detach themselves from the objects of sight, sound, touch etc., fulfill the partaking of sense objects without affection or hatred, eradicate pleasure and sorrow, and by doing so, live in divine cheerfulness with the mind at peace [62 - 68].  Not turning their attention to the things of sight, sound, touch etc. that stir the senses, completely filled with the Bliss of Brahman as the sea is filled with water, residing in an awakened state in the Kutastha which is inaccessible by the knowledge from the elemental world, renouncing attachment, desire and ego, fulfilling all of the resultant predestiny caused by the past like the rivers and streams gathering all their water and flowing into the sea, the ones with sthitaprajna are liberated from the entrapment of samsara.  Thus, they “move into”* Kaivalyapada.  Because of unending desires, those who are desirous take birth again and again and remain bound to this worldly life [69 - 71].  This [the state of the ones with sthitaprajna] is called residing in Atman-Consciousness, which is the death of all delusion.  If the jiva can be in this state at the time of death, it merges into the Supreme Vishnu and attains Kaivalyapada [72].
