[IMPORTANT NOTE: From this point in sloka 11:44 through sloka 11:49, there seems to have been an editing error in the published Bengali printing transcribed from the original handwritten text. The printed commentaries are displaced - they do not concord with the appropriate slokas from this point in 11:44 through 11:49. Upon examination, it can be found that by aligning the commentaries correctly with their respective slokas, there should have been no commentary for sloka 11:49 in the published Bengali print. This translation presents the material in the manner in which the commentaries correspond accurately to their respective slokas and indicates that there is in actuality no commentary for sloka 11:49 in the published Bengali print. No liberties have been taken with the actual translation of the Bengali. The commentaries have been merely lined up.
