2,idam jnanamupashritya mama sadharmyamagatah sargehpi nopajayante pralaye na vyathanti cha,"[Commentary:]3) That which is My Yoni, “All is Brahman, pervading all creation”* - that Brahman - Its Atom, one enters into That - meaning, the Stillness after Kriya - in the subtle Form of the Atom of Brahman - going where, one cannot speak anything at all - even if asked, one says “That is what It is!!!!!!”**[*Translator’s note:  The quotation marks and the text within them is in the original.][**Translator’s note:  The quotation marks are provided by the translator in order to mark the spoken statement.]"
3,mama yonirmahadbrahma tasmin garbham dadhamyaham sambhavah sarbhutanam tato bhavati bharata,"[Commentary:]4) All of those yonis from which all forms are coming about - those are singular and separate yonis - in those yonis too is Brahman; they also emerge from Brahman - but I am That individualized and Unified Great Yoni [Mahadyoni] - I am verily Its Seed, the Atom of Brahman Itself, and “pra” = in True Form - in the “da” sound is Yoni; it is in That that I keep It - meaning, I keep Self in the Self - which is the par avastha of Kriya - again, I am [also] the Father - meaning, endowed with Shakti, bringing My Form from within Me - the Form of Kutastha - Brahman!!!  Meaning, Son - meaning, Father; the Father is Himself the Son!!! The Son is Himself the Father!!!"
4,sarvayonishu kaunteya murtayah sambhavanti yah tasam brahma mahadyoniraham bijapradah pita,"[Commentary:]5) Sattva, rajah, tamah, the forms of ida, pingala, sushumna - mounted on the machine, they, with the five elements, mind, intellect and ego, looking with attachment-filled attention in directions other than Atman [or] Brahman, have [seemingly] bound the embodied - the Indestructible Atman, Kutastha Brahman!!  It is upon the liberation from that bondage that He is the Pure Free Buddha Being - the Form of Stillness after Kriya - the drum-stick will fall with a bang."
5,sattvam rajastama iti gunah prakritisambhavah nibadhnanti mahabaho dehe dehinamavyayam,"[Commentary:]6) There - meaning in the par avastha of Kriya – the five elements, mind, intellect, ego - it is in these that there is impurity - being without these and abiding in Atman is Purity.  Kutastha Brahman!!  When any thing becomes pure, Light is attained - the sword that has become rusted, if one cleans that via Kriya- which is transmitted via the teachings of Guru - such a Light manifests on that sword that one is able to see one’s own face. It is this that Patanjal has called in the Sutras as “Svarupa Darshanam” (meaning, in the natural mirror, the Self can see OneSelf)* - when the Self sees OneSelf and OneSelf becomes Brahman, then All is Brahman! And one sees All; thus the Light Itself is the Form - of Brahman! It is this that is spoken about in Vedanta as “Svaprakashasvarupa” [Light of Self-Revelation]. When all have become one thing, then how can there be any kind of destruction and another thing with an end - therefore - “avinashi” [indestructible] - devoid of mutation - if desiring attachment-filled pleasure from other things, He resides suffocated and bound in that.  Leaving that and residing as the Self in Atman - meaning, performing Kriya - there is liberation - meaning the par avastha of Kriya.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses - ( ) - and the text within them are in the original.  The bracketed - [ ] - text is provided by the translator for the purposes of clarification.]"
6,rtatra sattvam nirmalatvat prakashakamanamayam sukhasangena badhnati jnanasangena chanagha,"[Commentary:]7) “Rajah” - meaning ida; attachment-filled desire in some other thing - if it happens via Atman, it happens - if one prays for, wishes for and looks at that thing for a long time, one has the desire to have that thing with great expectation, which, when one does not get it, causes one to become extremely desperate.  That is what is known as “trishna” [thirst]; that thirst has bound you up quite well and is making you stand with hands joined together [in the form of prayer].   Because, by that thing, “my mind will have the fruit of satisfaction for a little while.”  In this way, that standing form is fulfilling karma in desire - within this body in the Form of Kutastha - meaning, Mahadeva’s - like some person standing in front of a confectioner’s shop."
7,rajo ragatmakam viddhi trishnasangasamadbhuvam tannibadhnati kaunteya karmasangenadehinam,"[Commentary:]8) Not residing in Atman - putting attachment-filled attention in other things is called “tamoguna” - meaning, pingala - all embodied ones - meaning, Mahadeva - have been kept mesmerized; otherwise the jiva itself is Shiva - meaning, performance of Kriya, which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru.  All of these acts by which He is being bound - with complete attachment in those, with chitta gone in that direction, full of expectation, like a drunken fool, what He says to whomever - false, and cannot pursue things - not being able to do so, He is agitated by His own heat [madness] and thus is madly dancing in many forms, and is passing through time in this way.  And He says “I have no time for anything” - and what He does, that He also does not know, because He is drunk!!!!  When opportunity for some good karma [action] comes in front of Him, to that He says, “I will do it later” - that “later” becomes later and later, and after that is sleep!!!!!!! OM.  As much as there is no priority, it is even more than that - meaning - even after having gone to bed in the early evening, rising late in the first part of the day - laziness - how many days like this?  Without a [physical] jail - even if it is said, it will not be heeded - what strange bondage without any binding - meaning, oneself is bound by oneself - meaning, no one even says “you should go to sleep” - “prostitute yourself” and such things."
8,tamastvajnanajam viddhi mohanam sarvadehinam pramadalasyanidrabhistannibadhnati bharata,"[Commentary:]9) If one always abides in Atman - meaning, performs Kriya, happiness arises in all ways - abiding automatically and naturally in happiness, one attains the Supreme Bliss of the par avastha of Kriya.  The Bliss about which no one has the ability to speak - the reason why It is “avyakta” [unspoken] - known by oneself - later cannot make anyone know.  The temporary fruits which come about through rajoguna with its desire for results - meaning, “this land is mine for a hundred years and there is no assurance as to whose it will be after that - the land is ten hands long, three and one-half hands wide, for which ten people will be murdered and how much will be the profit?”  The one who, by berating over and over about this becomes poor - this type of hobbyist-poor is the worker of rajoguna.  It is in this type of karma [action] that so many people are caught up - and who is this “I”?  And what is Atman?  That, even by mistake, does not come to mind from the time of birth until death - yet there is the sound of “gyan-gyan, ghan-ghan” [noisy bleating of pseudo-knowldege]; telling people “because I am rich, I will be wise,” and being like this.  Thus, filled with attachment, he pretty much spends all of his time on other things and discussions and such.  Whatever is left - that is lost in the snores of sleep, hidden every day in undisciplined state, and he lays fallen in deep darkness - therefore, it is because there is no Light that one has to live in darkness.  The Light which one must search for with self-effort.  Even knowing and hearing about that, he says things like, “I love to stay in that darkness” - “I have money, I’m eating, enjoying, shitting fluidly, I’m quite fine.”  Living in this type of indulgent darkness of falsehood and being intoxicated in this for a short time, death comes and grabs him like a bug."
9,sattvam sukhe sanjayati rajah karmani bharata janamavritya tu tamah pramade sanjayatyuta,"[Commentary:]10) First, one kills a person - having killed, he begins to grieve; in this way, covered by rajah and tamoguna, he takes up sattva guna - meaning, he comes to Benares [Varanasi] and becomes a Brahmachari [celibate monk] - because he has killed, he wails “oh! oh!” - from rajo guna, he comes to sattva guna, and then again he begins to say, “What will wailing do? I killed. So - fine. I did” - he comes to tamoguna from sattva guna; later he thinks that “What I did was not very good” - and again he comes to sattva guna from tamoguna.  Now, the one whom he had killed - people come again to fight on that person’s behalf - thus, from sattva guna, again he comes to rajoguna - death takes away these types of “palm-leaf soldiers” with the blow of one breath."
10,rajastamashchabhibhuya sattvam bhavati bharata rajah sattvam tamashchaiva tamah sattvam rajastatha,"[Commentary:]11) If attention is there, then the Light of Atman can take birth in all of the senses [gates] of this body.  That Knowledge of Kriya is happening, which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru.  That “vidya” [knowledge] is truly vidya; all else is “avidya” [ignorance/not-knowledge] - meaning, knowing that is truly knowing, and all else is not-knowing.  When that Kriya expands is when one resides in sattva guna."
11,sarvadvareshu dehehsmin prakasha upajayate jnanam yada tada vidyadvivriddham sattvamityuta,"[Commentary:]12) The preliminary state of the condition in which one’s heart goes in the direction of one’s desire-filled, thoroughly attachment-filled attention on some sense-object is called “lobha” [greed].  “Pravritti” - to completely keep mind on that thing constantly and always, becoming like that thing is called “pravritti” [engagement]; thoroughly eyeing something with attachment and suddenly taking action for it is called “arambha” [starting]; performing action with the craving for its fruits is called “karma.”  Not stopping desire in all ways - meaning, “I lost at this door; I’ll go to another door” - meaning, the lowest court of justice, small court of justice, superior court of justice etc. - these are all acts of rajoguna, the acts from the expansion of rajoguna."
12,lobhahpravrittirarambhah karmanamashamah spriha rajasyetani jayante vivriddhe bharatarshabha,"[Commentary:]13) Putting attachment-filled attention in directions other than Atman, residing in tamoguna, and pravritti - when the heart, filled with attachment, completely goes in that direction - meaning becoming that itself - being thoroughly drunk with that, entering that and being enraptured with that - these are all acts from the expansion of tamoguna."
13,aprakashohpravrittishcha pramado moha eva cha tamasyetani jayante vivriddhe kurunandana,"[Commentary:]14) True expansion in sattva guna will occur when one abides in the par avastha of Kriya and merge there - then, that which is called “supreme” - meaning, Kutastha Brahman of the Cosmos, traveling to the Plane of Brahman - residing there - where there is no impurity of any kind - meaning, residing in the Pure Brahman."
14,yada sattve pravriddhe tu pralayam yati dehabhrit tadottamavidam lokanamalan pratipadyate,"[Commentary:]15) When one goes and becomes thoroughly merged in rajoguna, then one performs actions with the craving for results - and when one becomes thoroughly merged in tamoguna, then one attains a state which is like that of an ignorant person - like an idiot!!!!  Awakened idiot (Brahman)* - is wanton in Brahman.  That is - he knows everything, yet he does not know.  Unconscious idiot (Brahman)** - is wanton with prostitutes - “does not know anything at all, yet says I know everything.”***[* and ** Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.] [***Translator’s note:  The quotation marks [in the positions seen] and the text within them are in the original.]"
15,rajasi pralayam gatva karmasangishu jayate tatha pralinastamasi mudhayonishu jayate,"[Commentary:]16) That act, which mind takes up without the desire for results - that is this Kriya, which is acquired through the teachings of Guru - this virtuous work of Truth, this sattvic karma [action] - its pure fruit is Brahman, which happens in the par avastha of Kriya.  The fruit of rajoguna - meaning, doing action with the desire for results itself causes sorrow - keeping attachment-filled attention elsewhere and residing in tamoguna - who is this “I” - that thing one cannot know - thus, he is unconscious - the result of tamoguna - like when some gentleman goes to a house of ill-repute and he himself forgets who he is."
16,karmanah sukritasyahuh sattvikam nirmalam phalam rajasastu phalam duhkhamajnanam tamasah phalam,"[Commentary:]17) After abiding in sattva guna - meaning, after performing Kriya, the Still Substance of the Knowledge of Brahman is known in the par avastha of Kriya.  Rajoguna - meaning, when one is in ida, then, because of the heart going in the direction of performing action with the craving for results, one desires the attainment of that in every way - this is what is known as yoga - staying in pingala causes one to be thoroughly maddened, intending to kill one person, kills another - being mesmerized towards that thing - oneself not knowing OneSelf - thus, unconsciousness happens in tamoguna."
17,sattvat sanjayate jnanam rajaso lobha eva cha pramadamohou tamaso bhavatohjnanameva cha,"[Commentary:]18) Continuously performing Kriya, goes to the top of the head - intoxication happens immediately upon going there - he enjoys that Bliss always - fighting and boasting is done in the middle region by strong-arming - which is the work of rajoguna - and base acts, residing below and traveling in the underworld, which is the work of tamoguna - which is extremely bad."
18,urdhvam gacchati sattvastha madhye tishthanti rajasah jaghanyagunavrittistha adho gacchanti tamasah,"[Commentary:]19) In the par avastha of Kriya - when ida, pingala, sushumna - who look in other directions - by which one’s attention is being constantly kept in that Atman - then, one goes beyond the three gunas, resides in ParaBrahman, and attains My Essence - meaning, becoming One, he automatically and spontaneously moves beyond intellect and goes to the Supreme Intelligence-Brahman."
19,nanyam gunebhyah kartaram yada drashtanupashyati gunabhyashcha param vetti madbhavam sohdhigacchati,"[Commentary:]20) Going beyond these three gunas, that Mahadeva resides in the par avastha of Kriya, who has risen from this body - meaning, Kutastha Himself has come - attaining the Supremely Tranquil Substance, becoming liberated from birth, death, old age and disease - [He enjoys] the Ambrosial Substance - meaning, He enjoys Immortality.Arjuna said:"
20,gunanetanatitya trindehi dehasamudbhavan janmamrityujaraduhkhairvimuktohmritamashnute,"[Commentary:]21) The energy of the body is saying - what are the signs of these three gunas?  And in what way can one be beyond them?  And in what way are these three gunas?  And in what way are people residing in these?  O Lord!  You are the One truly manifesting in this body - meaning, the Supreme Person - please speak.Sri Bhagavan said:"
21,kailingaistningunanetanatito bhavati prabho kimacharah katham chaitamstringunanativartate,"[Commentary:]22) It is being experienced via Kutastha - there is a certain kind of Revelatory Light in the par avastha of Kriya, where there is neither day nor night - it is in that Light where the heart goes completely; being imbued with that Essence one is like a thoroughly inebriated drunkard, having turned the heart from all other directions and being enraptured by That Substance; thus, all of the desire to stay in That - neither is that [desire] there, nor is the desire to not stay [in That] there - mounted on top of the head and sitting there, as if: who knows who is sitting there - sitting there like this - these three gunas - meaning, ida, pingala, sushumna - are not actually operating - meaning, in the subtle form in the Brahman Nadi, these gunas are in this kind of oneness in the par avastha.  One who knows this - it is he who goes to My Essence - meaning, however much it is possible, the par avastha of Kriya is being described (which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru - the sign of “ru” is Total Stillness).*[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]"
22,prakasham cha pravrittim cha mohameva cha pandava na dveshti sampravrittani na nivrittani kangkshati,"[Commentary:]23) All of the gunas are there just as they are - vayu is still, like an unlit lamp."
23,udasinavadasino gunairyo na vichalyate guna vartanta ityeva yohvatishthati nengate,"[Commentary:]24) Residing in OneSelf - sorrow and pleasure are both verily the same - at that time, gold and a clod of earth, condemnation and praise are both [all] verily the same; the way that a drunkard is the same in both the desirable and the undesirable; seeing from the Supreme Intelligence [which is] beyond intellect."
24,samaduhkasukhah svasthah samaloshtrashmakanchanah tulyapriyapriyo dhirastulyanindatmasamstutih,"[Commentary:]25) Honor, disgrace, enemy, friend, loss - all of these are the same as they are for a drunkard.  Even before the beginning of these, he is sitting there having renounced these - does not even want to begin - meaning, does not want to perform any karma in the par avastha of Kriya; it is this that is called “gunatita” [beyond the gunas]."
25,manapamanayostulyastulyo mitraripakshayoh sarvarambha parityagi gunatita sa uchyate,"[Commentary:]26) “Mamcha” - to Me - meaning, one who performs Kriya - not putting attachment-filled attention in other directions (mind)* - meaning, being “Sati” - keeping singular focus towards Kutastha, abiding in Atman, not looking with attachment on other things - one who performs Kriya with dharana, dhyan, samadhi and faith in the teachings of Guru - which is transmitted via the teachings of Guru - abiding in that par avastha of Kriya, going beyond the three gunas, being Still in Equipoise at all times of the day and night, one knows My Essence - meaning, “I have become the One Brahman” or “I am going to [become]” - this is realized - OM.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]"
26,mamcha yohvyabhicharena bhaktiyogena sevate sa gunan samatityaitan brahmabhuyaya kalpate,"[Commentary:]27) When, from the continuous performance of Kriya, there is True Stillness in that Brahman, then one attains Immortality, and Nectar falls - meaning, one becomes the One Brahman - then of course, One is the Immortal Indestructible - because, when all becomes Brahman, that which will be destroyed is also Brahman; if it [all] is One Substance without end, how can there be destruction?  If one always stays in that state - meaning, resides in that state in all parts of the day and night - he also becomes Brahman - this is what is known as “dharma” - performing Kriya without the desire for results is called “dharma,” which is transmitted via the teachings of Guru - residing where, there is one Happiness - meaning, one eternally resides in that One State of Supreme Bliss; which is experienced in the par avastha of Kriya by all those who perform Kriya, more or less - and it is for this Happiness that everyone is slaving for others, and murdering while “mahasaya, mahasaya” [respected sir] is said!!  But that rare Mahasaya - about whom Ashtavakra has spoken - meaning, the one who is always, constantly and totally lodged in Kutastha by Divine perception and with the Power of Self, and who does not see anything other than That Substance - it is he who is “Mahat” [great] or “Mahasaya” - that is who is a great person - whatever is given, there is happiness for a little while after having that; but the Happiness which has no end - no one at all wishes to attain that kind of Happiness - all people of all kinds must desire this Happiness!!!ity srimadbhagavadgitasupanishatsu brahmavidyayam yogashastre srikrishnarjunasamvade gunatrayavibhagayogonama chaturdashohdhyayahThus ends the Fourteenth Chapter."
