42,shamo damastapah shoucham kshantirarjavameva cha jnanam vijnanamastikyam brahmakarma svabhavajam,"[Commentary:]43) “Shouryam” = performing Kriya = by that, showing one’s abilities; “dhriti” = spontaneously abiding in the par avastha of Kriya; “dakhyam” - meaning, always performing Kriya, which is acquired through the teaching of Guru - does not move from doing Kriya - meaning, does Kriya day and night; gives Kriya; always establishes in Stillness in the Heart after Kriya - this is the work of kshatriyas, abiding in this par avastha of Kriya."

44,krishigorakshyavanijyam vaishyakarma svabhavajam paricharyatmakam karma shudrasyapi svabhavajam,"[Commentary:]45) One who always keeps attention on one’s own work of the Self, gradually, that person attains perfection in all things - meaning, upon abiding in the par avastha of Kriya, there is no desire for anything; staying continuously with one’s own work, and going on fully with the practice of Kriya, desire is stopped.  I am speaking of that; listen:-46) The place from where all are becoming - meaning, that self-attention being in other directions filled with attachment - which, when not there, one is becoming Mahadeva - [then] never is there a possibility of attention falling on any thing, because there is no jiva-pleasure in a corpse; for this reason, there is nothing in him - therefore, the jivatma is itself the cause of all substances; thus, “svakarma” - meaning one’s own work - Kriya without the desire for its fruits - doing this affectionately, with devotion and in all ways is called “archana”* - in this way, having received Kriya via the teaching of Guru, human beings attain the fulfillment of all things - meaning, the thing for which there is desire, once one gets that thing, desire no longer remains - in that way, when oneself resides in the Self Itself in the par avastha of Kriya, then, the way that [all] desires are stopped if one gets all things, that is the state that happens.  Like, the satisfaction that comes from eating a mango; when someone gets that same satisfaction without eating [the mango], then why would he look at the mango - meaning, why would he try to get a mango.  All of that is experienced in the par avastha of Kriya, which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru.[*Translator’s note:  Sanskrit transliterations may sometimes write “archana” as “arcana”, but then we would have to use other phonetic symbols, which we are not using.  To avoid any misunderstanding, also please note that here we are not using the western word “arcana.”  The “archana” we are using is a Sanskrit word.]"
46,sve sve karmanyabhiratah samsiddhim labhate narah svakarmaniratah siddhim yatha vindati tacchrinu - 45- yatah pravrittirbhutanam yena sarvamidam tatam svakarmana tamabhyacchya siddhim vindati manavah,"[Commentary:]47) If from time to time mind goes in other directions while performing Kriya, that is also all right, but keeping attention completely in another thing (another besides Atman)* with expectations and the desire for results - in that there is the fear of death, because if there is no death, who will enjoy that fruit.  If, upon continuously doing Kriya, the Immortal Substance - meaning the Stillness after Kriya in all parts of the day and night - does not happen and death itself comes, that is also good - but putting attention in other directions besides Atman with the desire for results - there will certainly be death, but in order to fulfill the enjoyment of the results, the fear of birth and death remains - meaning, just doing Kriya for a short while causes desire to stop - gradually, that is being experienced by everyone - meaning, Kriyanvita persons - it is unnecessary to write - abiding in the par avastha of Kriya with dhyan, dharana, samadhi - attachment-filled attention does not go in other directions; thus, no sin is incurred either.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]"

48,sahajam karma kaunteya sadoshamapi na tyajet sarvarambha hi doshena dhumenagnirivavritah,"[Commentary:]49) Do not put attachment-filled attention on any sense objects in the present condition and in the par avastha of Kriya - always abiding in Atman, via Atman, fight with Kriya and be victorious - meaning, when desires for all sense-things stop upon abiding in the par avastha of Kriya, then no karma with the desire for their fruits remain - when there is no desire for any sense-object, which used to be acquired through desire - thus, all things are acquired, which is called “siddhi” - so that is Supreme - meaning, when - beyond all - Brahman Is - the way that He is the Non-doer, yet the Doer - in the same way, without desire, all desires are fulfilled (without having desire)* - this is what is called “siddhi” and “sannyasi” - meaning, whatsoever is desired in the present condition - one does not do with non-dutiful work - this type of Still Intelligence happens in the par avastha of Kriya.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]"
49,asaktabuddhih sarvatra jutatma vigataspriha naishkarmyasiddhim paramam sannyasenadhigacchati,"[Commentary:]50) In this way, having attained Brahman, one receives all siddhis - in the way that it is done, understand that - absolutely extinguished in Stillness, and Brahman Darshan - the par avastha of Kriya upon abiding in Brahman - that is what is “para” - meaning, beyond which, there is nothing at all except Brahman."
50,siddhim prapto yatha brahma tathapnoti nibodha me samasenaiva kaunteya nishtha jnanasya ya para,"[Commentary:]51) Keeping mind Still in the par avastha of Kriya, abiding as locked in Brahman, and abiding automatically in Stillness in Atman is called - with dharana, dhyan and samadhi, disregarding words and such of desire for the fruits of actions - desire and aggression, which automatically do not remain in the par avastha of Kriya."
51,buddhya vishuddhaya yukto dhrityatmanam niyamya cha shabdadinvishayamstyaktva ragadveshou vyudasya cha,"[Commentary:]52) Always resides by oneself in the Self, eats little, keeps control of speech, thinks of oneself as small in a body, does not go about with arrogance, without taking mind in other directions and thinking oneself as small, abides in the Self - meaning, performs Kriya - which is transmitted via the teaching of Guru - does 1,728 pranayams every day, and does 21,736 pranayams from time to time - meaning, does pranayam day and night and always - meaning, always resides in this only - which happens automatically from continuously doing Kriya - when abiding in the Self at all times, having this kind of practice, then no desire in directions other than Brahman happens in any way - this is what is known as “vairagya” [non-attachment]; one who has this is the one who is “vairagi.”"
52,viviktasevi lagvashi yatavakkayamanasah dhyanayogaparo nityam vairagyam samupashritah,"[Commentary:]53) Ego, might, arrogance - meaning, going about with one’s chest puffed up, desire, anger, someone else’s house - meaning, not putting mind on other things except Brahman - from all of these - upon abiding in the par avastha of Kriya fully, one is freed from all of these aforementioned sense-matters; in that par avastha of Kriya, neither is there “me”, nor is there “mine” - which all Kriyanvita persons are experiencing; this is called Peace - meaning the end of Kriya itself - continuing to do this for a long time, one becomes Brahman Himself."
53,ahamkaram balam darpam kamam krodham parigraham vimuchya nirmamah shanto brahmabhuyaya kalpate,"[Commentary:]54) Becoming Brahman, just by its happening, oneself is in delight, because he does not at all put attachment-filled attention on other things besides Brahman; when he does not put attachment-filled attention on any thing, then there is no regretful grief about that other thing; it is when attachment-filled attention is given that one desires to acquire that [thing] - when there is not even attention on any other thing besides Brahman, then consequently, there is no craving for that either - sees Brahman in verily all phenomena, mobile and immobile; then all experiences happen spontaneously by themselves - having faith in the teaching of Guru, he resides as Himself in the Self and always performs Kriya, and thinks of that itself as fortune gained, the attainment which is the Wisdom above all."
54,brahmabhutah prasannatma na shochati na kankhati samah sarveshu bhuteshu madbhaktim labhate param,"[Commentary:]55) In this way, with devotion, one can reverently know what this “I” is; all that there is, is Me, and whoever there is, is Me - “tattvatah” - meaning, having done Kriya and having become Brahman, after that, knowing who I Am, it is in Me, verily, that Divine Union happens then."

56,sarvakarmanyapi sada kurvano madvyapashrayah matprasadadavapnoti shashvatam padamavyayam,"[Commentary:]57) Because Brahman Himself is doing all work via consciousness, knowing this ends all karma; because another person is performing whatever action; if you are not doing that karma [action], then for you that karma is eradicated - “matparah” = remain always in Atman and perform Kriya; through intelligence - meaning, via Stilled consciousness and abiding in the par avastha of Kriya, you will automatically do all work, which is the peculiar condition of sages, which automatically happens from the continuous practice of Kriya."
