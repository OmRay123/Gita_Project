12,sarvadvarani samyamya mano hridi niruddhya cha murdhnadhyatmanah pranamasthito yogadharanam,"[Commentary:]13) OM - the form of this body - then Kutastha - He is Brahman Itself!!!  With the utterance, surrendering to the Atom of Brahman - OM bhuh - Muladhar, meaning earth - OM bhuvah - Svadhisthan - water, meaning urine; OM mahah - Maharloka - Manipura (A) the region of the navel - that which rules within everyone in the form of Rudra - the secret place of this mind (accessible to yogis) - OM svah - from which all is born, meaning Anahata in the heart (B) - the abode of Mahadeva - takes birth by Himself - OM janah - the place from which all sounds arise - “a, aa, i, ee, ang, ah” - the sixteen letters [vowels] because of which - the sixteen-streamed Vishuddhakhya (C) - the abode of Shiva - the white manifestation of the form of Mahadeva - after that is Kutastha.(A) All speech/words arise because of vayu being in the energy of Manipura.  (B) That aforementioned fire becomes illuminated, settles in the heart, burns away all food and merges [dissolves] fire-energy into vayu.  (C) That vayu, going to the throat, merges into space and manifests as sixteen types of breath.  At the end of that sixteen-fold form - the Still subtle form - the revelation of Kutastha Itself - in the two-petaled Ajna Chakra, the revelation of Brahman Itself.Thereafter, one who, upon entering that Atom of Brahman, leaves the body while doing Omkar Kriya 3,456 times in every chakra in one breath - the Supreme Way that is attained - this is what is known as leaving life through yogic power.  And one who cannot do this - if he meditates upon Kutastha of those four chakras and leaves life while surrendered to the Atom of Brahman - doing this also brings attainment of the Supreme Way. (If correctly done, no questions remain.)*[*Translator’s note:  All parentheses - ( ) - and the text within them in the commentary to this sloka 8:13, are in the original.  Only the word within brackets - [ ] - are the translator’s for the purposes of clarification.  Within the commentary itself are footnotes provided by Yogiraj, which in the Bengali are delineated by letters that are literally “k”, “kh,” and “g” - the first three letters of the consonant section of alphabets in the Sanskritic family.  Because these particular letters were assigned as symbols for footnoted commentary, the corresponding letters that would normally be used for footnotes in English - “A”, “B”, and “C” have been used in this translation.]"

15,mamupetya punarjanma duhkhalayamashashvatam napnuvanti mahatmanah samsiddhim paramam gatah,"[Commentary:]16) All worlds that have been created from Brahman have their death and birth - attaining Me, meaning becoming Still - abiding in the par avastha of Kriya, birth does not happen again."
16,abrahmabhuvanallokah punaravartinohrjuna mamupetya tu kaunteya punarjanma na vidyate,"[Commentary:]17) For great sages, pulling and dropping happens one thousand times during the day - it happens like that at night also - those to whom this happens are the ones who can be called “brahmin” - meaning - those for whom, from the continuous practice of pranayam, one pull and drop generally takes 44 seconds to happen."
17,sahasrayugaparyantamaharshad brahmano viduh ratrim yugasahasram tam tehhoratra vido janah,"[Commentary:]18) When day and night - meaning that ida and pingala are still, and the movement is in sushumna - then this type of state is attained - he always resides in the state of Vijnana [beyond Knowledge] - where there is no day and night - yet the revealing Light like that of the day - like that - all forms that he sees, even the holes/cavities in them can be seen.  When one is not in this state - then nothing at all can be seen - that is what is known as “night” - when the sight, filled with attachment, verily goes to other things instead of Brahman - then it is “avyakta” - meaning - cannot comprehend anything at all."
18,avyaktadvyaktayah sarvah prabhavantyaharagame ratryagame praliyante tatreivavyaktasamjnake,"[Commentary:]19) All phenomena - having been created, become completely dissolved - if one stays in a different direction - that by which all have to remain in a paralyzed condition - those who do not perform Kriya - when Kriya is again performed, out from the darkness, the True Revelation of the True Self is attained."
19,bhutagramah sa evayam bhutva bhutva praliyate ratryagamehvashah partha prabhavatyaharagame,"[Commentary:]20) After this, remaining in the par avastha of Kriya - there is no “vyakta” [speakable or knowable] or “avyakta” [unspeakable or unknowable] - he - abiding always in Brahman, in the end merges in the Universal Brahman - one in whose phenomenal being this Knowledge has happened - he - though destructible, has no destruction - “indestructible”: does not at all have any destruction - meaning: remains as the Form of Brahman, like a particle in-between.  In that Form, whatever he wishes is fulfilled even before it is wished, or he can do so.  This is self-evident and perceivable - “the one who does, sees; whoever is seeing is seeing” - saying such, no one will believe it - do it and see!!!"

23,yatrakale tvanavrittimavrittim chaiva yoginah prayata yanti tatkalam vakshyami bharatarshabha,"[Commentary:]24) Like blazing fire all around, all directions will be aflame - in that, lightning will manifest - in that, there will light like daylight - white - a manifestation as if millions of suns and millions of moons have risen together - this will manifest in front of one after continuous practice of Kriya, day and night, for six months - those who reside in that and are in samadhi - these esteemed persons who are knowers of Brahman, like Bhisma and such - leaving the body."
24,agnirjyotirahah shuklah shanmasa uttarayanam tatra prayata gacchanti brahama brahmavido janah,"[Commentary:]25) When the yogi is disengaged from Kriya - meaning, attention filled with attachment is in other things, not meditating upon Atman, deluded as if in a dark night, like a small amount of moonlight - covered in the pleasures of samsara - the pleasure that does not remain forever - because the moon does not remain in the same state, and neither is its light like the sun - like that, the world contracts and expands - in this state - meaning staying in momentary pleasure - to the Winter Solstice - meaning, with effort, do not die in the house of death - meaning, they do not go there. Performing Kriya a little bit at a time for six months - and ordinarily, sadhus almost always in the southern direction - when the sun remains for six months - they do not die then. And when the sun is in the northern direction, it is in that that they die. At first, performing Kriya for six months, they see the moon - after that, they see Kutastha in Yonimudra - then again after another six months - with intense Light - they die then. That, after many days - meaning - they can see after almost one year of work - then, with the utterance, in Yonimudra - Omkar Kriya - which has been expounded upon in sloka 12."

White - meaning day; black - meaning night, which has been expounded upon in sloka 24. But in the day - meaning in the Summer Solstice with intense Light - dying while seeing this - there is no engulfment - meaning rebirth does not happen - and dying while only seeing the moon, rebirth will happen - the sadhus who die while seeing the Light of millions of moons and millions of suns, lightning within fire all around, and after that Kutastha Brahman Purushottama - those sadhus to whom this happens, they are sitting in front of Kutastha even though death has happened - the people who perform this Kriya properly, for many of them, they have had darshan of all sadhus in Yonimudra. Thus, they have attained the Supreme Abode - many have seen this."
26,shuklakrishne gati hyete jagatah shashvate mate ekaya yatyanavrittimanyayavartate punah,"[Commentary:]27) Yogis are never mesmerized - meaning, when they are in samadhi, attention never goes toward other things - for this reason, go into samadhi and remain lodged in Brahman."
27,naite sriti partha janan yogi muhyati kashchana tasmat sarveshu kaleshu yogayukto bhavarjuna,"[Commentary:]28) Seeing and hearing all - totally performing Kriya - seeing all people via Kriya in Kutastha and always abiding there - the result that comes about from this - transcending all of these - in Yonimudra seeing all sadhus in Kutastha sitting in front - there is fruition. Later, continuing to perform Kriya, from time to time performing pranayam twenty thousand seven hundred thirty six (20,736)* times in one sitting - gradually continuing to practice this, one attains “ekasana” in this way - meaning remains always in the state that is after Kriya - after which there is no abode - meaning the Supreme Abode - Brahman. One remains merged in That - meaning, attainment of Brahman happens - the One Who is the Primal Source of All.[*Translator’s Note: The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.]ity srimadbhagavadgitasupanishatsu brahmavidyayam yogashastre srikrishnarjunasamvade aksharabrahmayogonama ashtamohdhyayahThus ends the Eighth Chapter."
