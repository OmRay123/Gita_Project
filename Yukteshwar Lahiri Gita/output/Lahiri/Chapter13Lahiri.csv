21,purushah prakritistho hi bhunkte prakritijan gunan karanam gunasangohsya sadasadyonijanmasu,"[Commentary:]22) That Maheshvara is Himself Guru; that country which cannot be found can be seen through the teachings of Guru - it is when Stillness occurs in that Particle of Brahman that one can see the Infinite, Cosmos-pervading, Universal Form of Brahman.  It is He who is the Lord of Sustenance for all - meaning, the Lord of Sustenance for oneself is the Self Itself - even after knowing this, like fools, people say, “Oh God, oh God! How can I can carry on in this samsara,” and uselessly pass through time in this way.  People think, “I am eating from having earned it.”  But one is obviously and clearly seeing - which people do not see even after looking - that a dead person does not eat - He is residing in me, and thus it is He who is eating; and that the One who is eating is also the One who is eating all things in all places, having taken the form of jiva - there is a bug in the teeth of even the exemplary [even seers do not see/no set precedents show perfection]; He is the One Brahman in all phenomena and in jivas, and is spoken about as Maheshvara, Jaganmay, Jagannath, Brahmamay in all scriptures.  If one abides in Him, one becomes He Himself - that, which even though known in the par avastha of Kriya, cannot be found by anyone - therefore: Avyakta [undefinable, unspeakable].  Only - after 1728 pranayams, yogis are on the way of dhyan.  It is He Who is the Kutastha after Self.  It is in this very body that one can see One Supreme Person after Kutastha, via knowing Kriya through the teachings of Guru (in this body).*[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them are in the original.][A reminder to the readers:  all bracketed - [ ] - statements are from the translator, unless otherwise noted, and are used for the purposes of clarification, whereas all statements within parentheses - ( ), unless otherwise noted, including the parentheses themselves, are in the original commentaries.]"

25,anye tvevamajanantah shrutvanyebhya upasate tehpi chatitarantyeva mrityum shrutiparayanah,
25,"25) Listening to all this - meaning, listening about appropriate action - they take some particular thing which they steady in the mind and sit; they too, not having received anything else, simply listen to the Omkar Sound and stay in repose; they also cross over - meaning, the Tranquil Stillness from the performance of Kriya is experienced.","[Commentary:]26) All that has happened which you see - immobile and mobile - in all of these is Sat-Brahman; and He is also the manifested form of all - the field, in the Form of Prakriti; and He is also in all as the knower of the field - the form of jiva - the Supreme Person, Brahman-Being, All-pervading One - He Is.  Thus, upon seeing that One Purusha, abiding single-mindedly in that One Purusha, the One is Itself One - meaning, in Brahman is Brahman.  Then, nothing else remains to be known or acquired."

30,yada bhutaprithagbhavamekasthamanupashyati tata eva cha vistaram brahma sampadyate tada,"[Commentary:]31) Therefore, in One is all, in all is One; then where is Its beginning?  Then, where are the gunas even?  Because gunas have all become Brahman - they have merged in Brahman in the place after Kriya - in the par avastha of Atman, Stillness has been attained - That which is Infinite even though Settled; where is any destruction for That?  He - meaning, the one to whom this type of Knowledge has happened - even while residing in the body, is not doing anything - anything is Brahman - doing is also Brahman!!  Therefore, he is not doing anything - if there were another substance, then he could become enmeshed; all is Brahman; thus he is “nirlipta” [non-enmeshed, non-engulfed]."
31,anaditvannirgunatvat paramatmayamavyayah sharirasthohpi kaunteya na karoti na lipyate,"[Commentary:]32) In the way that space moves in subtle form throughout all in the immense Universe - meaning, stillness - its function is stillness and movement both!!  In the path of the subtle is Stillness, in the path of the physical is movement!!!  But subtleness is functioning as non-enmeshed [nirlipta].  In that way, the microcosm, in atomic form, is in all bodies - Brahman is pervading but in Stillness.  In that way, the Self in the body - which is the microcosmic Brahman - is residing in all places.  Movement is happening, yet there is Stillness!!  As soon as there is Stillness there is Nirlipta Brahman - That Stillness is the par avastha of Kriya - one who does not have It is residing in the world - meaning, from the time of birth onward, is only living in movement.  The way to stop the movement of the Universe is just this Kriya - which is transmitted via Guru and can be done with ease.  Only having a bit of priority to keeping attention in this direction [is needed] and “one will be pulled along by the current only”* - grab hold of a pillar [post] which is within you.[*Translator’s note:  The quotation marks and text within them is in the original.]"
32,yatha sarvagatam soukshmyadakasham nopalipyate sarvatravasthito dehetathatma nopalipyate,"[Commentary:]33) Just as one sun illuminates the entire earth, in the same way the Embodied One illuminates this body - (Note)* - as long as there is darkness - meaning, oneself’s attention, filled with attachment, is elsewhere, and the Atman’s sun-like illumination via Kutastha is not being revealed.[*Translator’s note:  The parentheses and the text within them is in the original.  The parenthetical is in English in the original.]"
33,yatha prashayatyekah kritsnam lokamimam ravih kshetram kshetri tatha kritsnam prakashayati bharata,"[Commentary:]34) The field and the knower of the field - meaning, the body and the embodied - are known as soon as the Knowledge-Eye Kutastha is revealed - meaning, Yonimudra - mind does not go in other directions and stays only in that Divine Sight - which is transmitted via Guru’s teaching!  The five elements - Muladhar, Svadhisthan, Manipura, Anahata, Vishuddhakhya - these five elements - the Self-linga - intercourse is done by the linga in the linga - when mind is stilled, there will be intelligence - after intelligence is Parabuddhi [Intelligence which is Beyond] - meaning, the Purusha after Prakriti - that is Itself Me-Brahman!!  It functions like - Prakriti, in the Mighty Form of Kali - mounted on top of Maheshvara is slaying everyone in Her own maya.  Mahadeva takes Her back in His very own Form.  Once taken, attention is no longer in other directions - the Self remains in the Self - that is the par avastha of Kriya, and beyond all - merging in that - this is what is known as Moksha [liberation].  This itself is the Supreme Thing, this itself is the Supreme Thing.ity srimadbhagavadgitasupanishatsu brahmavidyayam yogashastre srikrishnarjunasamvade kshetrakshetrajnavibhagayogonama trayodashohdhyayahThus ends the Thirteenth Chapter."
