1,"The Lord said: “I will again speak the knowledge that is the best and supreme among all knowledge, knowing which, all “munis” [sages; see further explanation in commentary below] go from here (from the bondage to the body) to the Abode of Liberation.”  ","In the previous chapter [Chapter 13 of the Bhagavad Gita], it was stated that all things that emerge come forth from the union of the field and the knower of the field. That the union of the field and the knower of the field does not happen on its own, but happens by Will of God – to show that, the Lord began this chapter [Chapter 14 of the Bhagavad Gita] by saying, “paraṃ bhooyah pravakshyAmi” [I shall [further] declare the highest] etc. In the 22nd sloka of the previous chapter, it was said that being situated in Prakriti and the association with the gunas [primal qualities] comprise the cause of samsara. Now the question is: what kinds of associations are made to the gunas, and to which of them? What are “gunas” anyway? And how do they bind one? How can one be Liberated from all of the gunas? And what are the signs of the [spiritually] Emancipated person? The knowledge of all of these matters is that which is the “best and supreme” knowledge. That is what has been spoken about in this chapter. It is by knowing that supreme knowledge that the “munis” [sages] (those whose “manovrittis” [mental waves] have completely merged [in the Self] – them) have attained the highest perfection – meaning: after which there is no more spiritual practice or fruits of spiritual practice – those who have attained that supreme state beyond the destruction of body-vanity/body-identification [are “munis”]. And those who do know [such knowledge] – they experience “jivanmuktatva” [the state of being Free while still carrying on life in the body] before they leave the body [before physical death], and afterwards, they merge in Brahman."
2,"By taking refuge in this knowledge, they attain My Self, and thus, they are not born at the time of creation, nor do they suffer at the time of dissolution.","This supreme and best knowledge that is being spoken about – this knowledge – if one performs spiritual practice with intense force, one attains the Dharma of “I” – meaning: one attains the Self Itself; one merges in Brahman. Just as delusional fear of a snake automatically leaves when it is seen that it is just a rope-bunch that is laying there – it is like that. In this state, there is neither duality nor non-duality – no mutations of perception are there. So naturally, creation-time’s emergence and dissolution-time’s destruction – there is no space for the sufferings caused by any of the pains of these two."
3,O Bharat [Arjuna]! The “Mahadbrahma” is My Yoni (the womb-place). I place My seed (the seed of the world) in that. It is from that that all phenomena and living beings arise.,"The meaning of the word “mama” [see first line of sloka above] is “mine” – meaning: the ego’s. “Yoni” – [means] the place of establishment (the source [place of beginning]). “Mahadbrahma” – “mahat” means “bigger than everything else.” One whose boundaries or beginnings and ends cannot be found anywhere. Even though it is not the Unlimited Great, it still pretends to be unlimited and great, and fools everyone; that is “mahat.” That is why one of its names is “Mahadbrahma,” or “Maya.” There we have the residing place of ego – Maya. I place into the womb of that Maya [My seed] – meaning: it is because I take that Maya into Me that Maya has a womb (the emergence-giving power). This is because: if I do take Maya into Me, then Maya remains closed; She has no power to give birth to anything. When there is a womb in the aforementioned way [in Me] – it is only then that She gives birth to all phenomena and living beings (this creation). There is no creation in Knowledge/Awareness; creation only happens in ignorance/unawareness. That is why, in order to explain the process of creation, “I take Maya (ignorance) into Me” – this statement has to be made. (See Chapter 9, sloka 17 [of the Bhagavad Gita].)"
4,"O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! All of the forms that take birth in all of the wombs – “Mahadbrahma” is their womb, and I am their seed-issuing Father.","O Arjuna! All of the kinds of wombs that there are – gods, demons, animals, birds etc. – and all of the kinds of forms that come forth from them – the womb of all of that is that “Mahadbrahma,” and that “Aham” (“I”) is the seed-giving Father. "
5,"O mighty-armed one [Arjuna]! Even though they are “avyakta” [not apparent], sattva, rajas, tamas – these three gunas [primal qualities], being with Prakriti, bind the embodied one in the body.","It has already been said, “I am not the embodied one”; “I am not the body”; “the ‘I’ does not have a body”; “I am not a jiva [embodied soul]”; “I am the Immutable Consciousness.” So, what are the three gunas [primal qualities]? And again, how do they bring the Undiminishing “I” to the bondage of the body? That is why, in order to explain, it is being said that sattva, rajas and tamas – these three gunas rise from Prakriti. O mighty-armed one! (The one who can bring everyone under control by wrapping his/her two arms around them – that is the one who is “mighty-armed.”) These three gunas smear mutations even onto the Undiminishing and Immutable, bring one into the body, and bind one as an embodied being.  "
6,"O Anagh (sinless one) [Arjuna]! Among those three gunas, sattva guna is revealing (illuminating) due to its clarity/purity, and it is “anaamaya” [peaceful]. Thus, it binds through the association of contentment/pleasure and [mental] knowledge.","Among those three gunas, sattva is clear/pure, is the illuminator of everything and is peaceful. That is why it brings together “sukha” [contentment/pleasure] (“su” = “sundar” [beautiful] + “kha” = void – meaning: with a pain-free experiential state), and “jnana” [knowing; ascertaining] – meaning: “I am happy; I am a knowledgeable one” and such mental movements are born. This coming together [of contentment/pleasure and knowledge] is called “oppression” or “bondage.” This [is called bondage] because I am actually nothing but the conflict-free Great and nothing else at all. Thus, there is the putting up of some other non-substance called “contentment/pleasure” and bringing it [apparently] into the “I”, the “I” in which there is no place for anything to come. And there is the mixing together [of “I”] with [mental] knowledge as well. This delusion of losing one’s true awareness – this is indeed bondage.

The word “jnana” has [the letters] “j”, “gn” [no Roman alphabet equivalent to the original Sanskrit], “a” [long], and “na” – these four letters. Among these, the meaning of the letter “j” means: “jaayamaan” – meaning: everything that is of emergence-preservation-destruction – those. And “gn” means the “essence of smell” – meaning: that which reveals the actions of the five tanmatras [elemental sources] – sound, touch, sight, taste, smell – mixed together – that. These two letters [“j” and “gn”] together make “jna” [no real equivalent in the Roman alphabet to the Sanskrit original]. The meaning of this “jna” sound is: everything that is within the realm of emergence-preservation-destruction-sound-touch-sight-taste-smell. The letter “a” [long] means “aasakti” [addiction; attachment] and the letter “na” means “naasti” [negation]. Thus we have: the state where there is no addiction/attachment to anything of emergence-preservation-destruction-sound-touch-sight-taste-smell is that which is called “jnana.” That which makes one enjoined to this “jnana” – that is that which is called “sattva guna.” Now, dear sadhak, understand how the bondage is when pleasure and knowledge come together."
7,"O Kaunteya [Arjuna]! Know that rajoguna [alternate spelling of rajas guna] is passion-endowed, and it is the maker of thirst [want] and attachment. It binds the embodied one through attachment to actions.","That from which there is birth/emergence – that is verily rajoguna. “Rajah” [rajas guna] also means the functionality of “coloring” [influence; staining] – like coloring white cloth by dunking it [in dye]. The operation of smearing the Maya-mutation ego in the Pure Brahman and dressing one up as jiva [embodied being] is called “raja” [rajas guna]. This rajoguna is passion-endowed – meaning: full of desirousness. It is from this desirousness that thirst and attachment arise. The craving for an unreceived thing is called “thirst” [want], and having love in the mind for some received thing is called “attachment.” All of these are actions. That by which there is the wish to get something other than “I” – that is that which is called “rajas.” The purport of this wishing is desirousness. The power that that desirousness has is attachment. That attachment is that which makes one submit to enslavement. That enslavement is that which is bondage. That submission bit is action, and the enslavement bit is bondage. It is through rajoguna that the jiva succumbs to the power of desirousness and becomes bound to karma [actions and their fruits]."
8,"O Bharat [Arjuna]! However, tamoguna arises from ignorance. Know that it is for this reason that every embodied being is deluded/confused. It binds one through madness, laziness/indolence, and sleep.","Prakriti has a part where the power of veiling is predominant. It is from this [condition of] ignorance that tamoguna emerges. This ignorance-born tamas deludes/confuses all living beings, makes them lose themselves, and imprisons them through madness, laziness/indolence and sleep.

(These are statements regarding the tamas guna that is born of Prakriti. That which is “pure tamas” – that is [actually] the ending place for Prakriti [or: the place of repose for Prakriti], that which is [also] called “Kaivalya Sthiti” [being established in Only-ness]. That is Alone, Emancipated, or, is the Settledness in Brahman. Prakritic activities do not reach there.) "
9,"O Bharat [Arjuna]! Sattva guna enjoins one to pleasure and rajoguna enjoins one to action, and tamoguna [tamas guna] covers up intelligence/knowledge and enjoins one to madness.","Sattva guna is revelatory; it stays in one place and illuminates/reveals all. Those whom it illuminates – they are forced to succumb to the power of the illuminator/revealer. Thus, the lordship [of sattva] comes about automatically. This type of experiencing of such states is called Prakritic happiness. Sattva guna brings one to this [type of] happiness. Rajoguna is active. It wishes to work. It does not remain in one place. The active aspect of this guna is only restlessness. It enjoins one to action. And tamoguna [tamas guna] is ignorance. The consciousness brought about by action and the illuminator/revealer – [tamoguna] drains that away [or: covers that up], and causes opposition to right action. That which causes harm – it enjoins one verily to that, like putting liquor into a healthy body and staying unconscious [in a stupor] – this type of action. This is that which is called “pramaad” [madness]. O Bharat [Arjuna]! The Stillness of Only-ness that is of “pure tamas” – that does not exist in this Prakritic tamas."
10,"O Bharat [Arjuna]! Sattva guna rises forth by subduing the guna-duo of rajas and tamas (does its work of enjoining one to contentment/pleasure, knowledge and such); rajoguna rises forth by subduing the guna-duo of sattva and tamas (does its work of enjoining one to thirst [want], attachment and such); and tamoguna rises forth by subduing the guna-duo of sattva and rajas (does its work of enjoining one to madness, laziness and such).","O Bharat [Arjuna]! These three gunas that have now been spoken about – none of them can work if they rise up at the same time. When sattva is predominant, then rajas and tamas – both are subdued. And again, the time that rajas manifests, sattva and tamas are subdued. Similarly, at the time of the operation of tamas, rajas and sattva experience inactivity."
11,When consciousness manifests in all of the doors of this body – know that it is at that time that sattva guna is present and active.,"The ten [primary] organs have ten operations, but the worldly experience is of five types. Enjoying/partaking again and again, no contentment is coming forth from any of these [five]. The more one enjoys/partakes, the more the lust for enjoyment and partaking grows. If enjoyment/partaking goes on like this, then even millions of brahmakalpas [enormous epochs] do not bring about the quelling of the lust for enjoyment/partaking; it just goes on growing and growing. It is not possible to end the coming and going [the cycle of birth and death] like this. Therefore, without extreme withdrawal from all of these things, there is no other way of being delivered from the hands of death.

The work of the organs of perception is to grasp. The work of the organs of action is to let go. And for as long as they remain, they will do these works. What I enjoy the first time, no matter how many times I enjoy that again, there is no newness in that enjoyment at any other time like the first time. So what is the use of spending time with that stale enjoyment? When this knowledge takes over in the heart fully, know that that is the establishment of sattva guna. The word “sarvadvara” [all doors; or: doors of all] means the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness]."
12,"O Bharatarshabha [Arjuna]! “Lobha” [greed], “pravritti” [effort to attain/have], “arambha” [commencement/undertaking] of all actions [also called “karmarambha”], “ashama” [disquiet; lack of serenity], and “spriha” [wishfulness] – these signs are born when rajoguna spreads. ","Even when there is great wealth and such, the lust that goes on growing to have even more – that is called “lobha” [greed]. The desire to enjoy the worldly experience is called “pravritti” [effort to attain/have]. To begin the endeavor to fulfill desires is called “karmarambha” [commencement of actions to gain]. “I will do this; I will do that” – the distress that is experienced with this way of the mind not being satisfied with anything at all – that is that which is called “ashama” [disquiet; lack of serenity]. Desiring immediately upon seeing things is called “spriha” [wishfulness; immediate desire]. When all of these active functionalities arise in the mind – one must know at that time that rajoguna has spread."
13,"O Kurunandan [beloved child of the Kurus; Arjuna]! “Aprakash” [non-revealing], “apravritti” [non-endeavoring], “pramaad” [madness] and “moha” [delusion] – when all of these aspects are born – that is when tamoguna has spread. ","The capability and strength to do work are fully there, but how to do that [work] – there is no light at all to know that. This type of dull/unintelligent state is called “aprakash” [non-revealing].
 
If I want, I can do everything/anything, but there is no attempting to do so. This kind of heaviness in the mental state is called “apravritti” [non-endeavoring].
 
Not looking at the good, and running towards doing only bad things is called “pramaad” [madness].
 
Being intoxicated and staying in a stupor is called “moha” [delusion; being stupefied]. O delight of the lineage of Kurus [Arjuna]! When all of these states rise up and manifest themselves in the antahkarana, know that, at that time, you have been surrounded by the mutations of tamas."
14,"When sattva guna has taken over – when the jiva dies, then he/she will attain the planes of the highly knowledgable luminaries. ","If any embodied being dies during the time of experiencing the previously mentioned qualities of sattva guna – if that happens – the luminous planes (the abodes of enjoying [higher] pleasures) of those who are knowledgable about Mahat and such – that being goes to those planes. (See Chapter 8, sloka 6 [of the Bhagavad Gita].)"
15,"When one dies during the time that rajoguna is predominant, one is born in the plane of humans, which is attached to karma [actions and their fruits]. And [if death occurs] during the time that tamoguna is predominant, the dead person takes birth in a womb of ignorance, such as animals etc.","If the body is cast off during the operation of rajoguna, the human is enjoined to karma [actions and their fruits] and rebirth is given – meaning: [the event] makes one get the plane of humans. Similarly, if death occurs during the time that tamoguna is manifesting, it makes one take birth in the wombs of animals and birds and such. ([See] Chapter 8, sloka 6 [of the Bhagavad Gita].)"
16,The learned ones have said that the fruits of sattvic acts are predominated by sattva guna and are pure; the fruits of rajasic acts are of pain/sorrow; and the fruits of tamasic acts are of ignorance (delusion).,"The fruit of good (sattvic) acts is the attainment of pureness (having happiness). The fruit of rajasic acts is pain/sorrow (the quarreling between the good and bad of the plane of humans). And the fruit of tamasic acts is ignorance – meaning: the continuous current of eating, sleeping, having sex, being afraid [etc.]. This happens for the lower types of humans [down through] inert matter."
17,Knowledge arises from sattva guna. Only greed arises from rajoguna. And madness and delusion arise from tamoguna. ,"The light of sattva guna makes one understand “I”. What this “I” is – to know that is that which is called “jnanaprapti” [having knowledge]. Rajoguna increases the lust to get other beings’ things in any way possible. And the tamasic state is the playground of madness, delusion and ignorance."
18,"Persons with predominantly sattvic tendencies go upward. Persons who are rajas-predominant stay in the middle. And the tamasic (deluded) ones, established in madness, delusion and such, go downward.","Those who practice sattva guna attain the upper destinations (from the lower levels of heaven to enjoying abodes such as the Sphere of Vishnu etc., even up to merging with Brahman). The sporting ground of this begins at the Ajna-chakra, [going] in the upward direction. If there is rajoguna, it forces one to act, due to being under the power of embedded desires. That is why they go neither up nor down, but do their coming and going [take births and deaths] in the middle plane (the karmic plane of humans), due to being enslaved by birth and death. Its sporting ground is Anahata.

The lower front area of the loins is called “jaghan” [place of vileness]. The sporting ground of tamoguna is the “Kampur-chakra” [lust-center]. Because this is in the place of “jaghan,” it is “jaghanya” [vile; of “jaghan”; see second line of above sloka for occurrence of the word]. The manifested forms of “kama” [lust] and “rati” [coition] reside in this chakra. The one in whose antahkarana [inner being] the activities of this “kama” and “rati” do their sporting – that one is said to be “jaghanyavrittistha” [established in vile nature]. This being’s attention, instead of being in the upward direction, is in the downward direction, because of which, [this being] attains the lower destinations. (See the commentary to Chapter 1, sloka 1 [of the Pranab Gita].)"
"19,20","When the jiva [individual soul], upon becoming a witness, no longer sees anything/anyone as “doer” other than the aggregate of the gunas, and knows the Self that is beyond all of the gunas, which is the Witness of that [the works of the gunas], then that being attains My State (Brahman-ness). The embodied one, going beyond this knowledge [of the gunas] –  which is the seed of the emergence of the body – becomes freed from the pain of birth, death and old age/infirmities, and attains Supreme Bliss.","From what I have now seen, it can be understood that those gunas are the ones that have dressed up as the activities and causalities in/of the worldly experience, and are playing their sports in multifarious ways by [constantly] changing their forms. Showing scenes of the non-living, such as sand, earth, stone etc., and the living, such as humans, animals, birds etc., they are putting up a “world” and causing troubles. The operators of these troubles are none other than those three gunas and no one else. The knowledgeable one who, through concentrated and sustained [spiritual] practice, sees that those three gunas are verily the creators and operators of all of those states and everything, and [also] knows the Self – Who is beyond the gunas and is in the form of Witness [to all] – that is the one who, upon witnessing those guna-matters, attains “I” Itself – meaning: attains My State of Vasudeva [the Omnipresent; the All] (“vAsudeva sarvamiti” [Vasudeva is All] – this direct Knowledge). How does that being attain “Vasudeva-ness”? But like this: those very familiar gunas can no longer put that knowledgeable being inside that body of physical, subtle and causal aspects, [that body that is] is built by those three gunas. In front of that being, their broken illusory web does not become whole again. It is the body that is born and makes one suffer the pains of birth, death and infirmities. But with the destruction of the cause of the appearance of that body, no actions manifest any more. With the absence of a foundation for enjoyment (because of the absence of body-oriented-consciousness) – the non-emergence of the pain of birth, death and old age/infirmities – that is that which is called “the attainment of one’s True Form beyond the three gunas,” the “attainment of Immortality for the embodied one,” or “Emancipation.” And that certainly does happen."
21,Arjuna said: “Lord! By what signs does the embodied one go beyond the three gunas? What kind of character does that being have? Through what methods does that being become established by going beyond the three gunas?”,"The sadhak [spiritual practitioner], who is accustomed to go about as one who is under the powers of the actions and manifestations of the gunas, wanting to know how it all is with the characteristics, gait, and way of being in the state beyond the three gunas, as well as the enjoyment of Immortality while carrying on the body, is at the moment observing his/her state of consciousness from the time just before [this present state in this sloka], and saying: “O Lord. How does one go beyond those three gunas? By what signs are the great souls who are beyond the three gunas recognized? And how is the character and behavior of those great souls, or what kind [of characteristics and behaviors] do they display? Tell me these very things."
"22,23,24,25","The Lord said: “Illumination, endeavor, delusion – when all of these activities of the gunas are active together (towards the substances) – the one who does not hate, and while being unengaged, does not want (substances); the one who, being aloof, just remains as one is and is not perturbed by the activities of all of the gunas – (instead) ‘all are doing their own works according to their nature’ – knowing this, remains settled, and does not get restless; the one for whom pleasure and pain are the same; the one who is ‘svastha’ (settled in the Self); the one for whom a clod, stone and gold are the same; the one for whom dear and non-dear are the same; the one who is steady; the one for whom derision or praise [towards oneself by others] is the same; the one who remains in the same state [of steadiness] in honor and dishonor; the one for whom even friend and foe are the same; and the one who renounces all undertakings – that is the one who is said to be beyond the gunas.”","O Pandava [Arjuna]! This illumination that is the work of sattva, the endeavoring of rajas, the delusion of tamas – the one who does not have either attachment or repulsion towards these [this sentence is left incomplete in the original]. The qualities [the gunas] are themselves qualities, and the actions of the qualities are simply qualities in another form – the one who, understanding this, becomes a witness of the gunas, and in order to attain one’s own Self, renounces endeavoring, and in order to annihilate suffering and ignorance, does not long for withdrawal [either] – that is the one who is called “gunateet” [beyond the gunas].
Just as – if one sits up above in a high place, no one from below can touch that person – in the same way, the one who keeps oneself apart from the gunas and the works of the gunas, and does not feel obstacles or conflicts from the works of the gunas; the one who is “svastha” [abiding in the Self] – meaning: always settled in one’s True Self; the one for whom the perception of differences between pleasure and pain, in a clod (lump of earth), stone (rock), gold and such have disappeared; the one in whose antahkarana [inner being] no functionalities called dear or non-dear arise; the one for whom there is no feeling of derision and praise, honor and dishonor, enemy or friend – what to say, the one who has even renounced every kind of endeavor (the one who does not begin any kind of thing) – that is the one who is called “gunateet” [beyond the gunas]."
"{26,27}{stop}","The one who serves, through single-minded bhakti-yoga, Me alone – that being goes beyond all of these gunas completely, and becomes fit to attain Brahman Itself. This is because I AM the Foundation (the Deity) of Brahman, and I AM also the Foundation of the Indestructible, Immortality, the Pure Dharma and Absolute Happiness as well.","This “I” – the “I” that is Only and Alone, the One onto Whom no dabs of the waverings of addition or subtraction can be stuck – keeping this “I” unswerving in the way taught by guru – and, being free of all wavering, the one who makes the effort to merge [in the Self] – that one goes beyond all gunas and becomes That which is meant by the word “Brahman.” That Brahman is like this: the One Who simply Is and just Is, the One in Whom there is no end/limit, the One Who is Indestructible, the One Who is Eternal, the One Who is Dharma, the One Who is the Highest Happiness – That.

“BrahmaNo hi pratiShThAham” [I AM the Foundation of Brahman] – the meaning of this statement is: I AM the Deity [aspect] of Brahman – meaning: I am Brahman in Concentrated Form, or – I am Kutastha Chaitanya – like the concentrated aspect of the light [of the sun] is called the “solar sphere.” Energy and heat is unseen but they are all-pervading. With greater or lesser amounts (being subtle or extremely fine), the energy that is in every substance – as that energy concentrates in one place – as heat increases more and more, becomes intensified and concentrated, and then takes on a luminous form, and takes on the name of “fire-flame” – in the same way, the extremely subtle, unseen Consciousness-Essence (Brahman-Substance) becomes concentrated in the Kuta, takes on the Form of Revelatory Light, and takes on the name of “Aham” [“I”].

That is why this “Aham” or “I” is called “Ghana Chaitanya” [Concentrated Consciousness/Spirit]. It is for this reason that the Formless Brahman’s Foundation (Deity, Formed Consciousness, or Form [of Consciousness]) is “I”. I AM Brahman – Indestructibility Itself, Immortality Itself, the Pure Dharma Itself and Absolute Happiness Itself. But “Aham” is the Deity [aspect] of Brahman. That is why this “Aham,” the Supreme Bliss Itself, the Supreme Person Kutastha Chaitanya – is the Foundation of all of this."
