1,"The Lord said: “O Mahabaho [mighty-armed one; Arjuna]! You feel dearness coming from Me to you through the words I speak to you. And so, as I desire the best for you, listen again to the teachings that I will speak to you now, regarding resolution with the Supreme Self. ”","In the 1st sloka of the 7th Chapter [of the Gita], the Lord said to Arjuna, “Hear now the way in which you can know Me completely and without any doubt.” Saying this, the Lord began to speak about His wonders, might, power, opulence/sovereignty etc. Through these [following] sayings: in Chapter Seven [of the Gita] – “raso’hamapsu kaunteya” [I am the liquidity in water, O son of Kunti] etc., in Chapter Eight – “adhiyojna’evamAtra” [I am the “adhiyajna” [Lord of offerings] indeed; see Chapter 8, slokas 3-4, item 6 for spiritual definition and explanation of “adhiyajna”] etc., and in Chapter Nine – “aham kraturahaṃ yajnah” [I am the rite, I am the fire sacrifice] etc., the Lord described the Self in a very concise manner. And in the last sloka of Chapter Nine, He also explained the method through which the Self can be attained. With this, the disciple Arjuna received the Lord’s endearment. But, in case all doubts are not removed because of such a summarized explanation, the Lord is again [or: further] elucidating the teachings regarding resolution with the Supreme Self."
2,"The gods do not know My Origin, neither do the “maharshi[s]” [great seer[s]]. This is because I AM before all gods and great sages.","That “I” which is on the upper side of “Vivasvan” [see commentary to 4:1-2 of the Pranab Gita] – the gods do not know that. That is because they are enjoyers of the fruits of karma [acts; rites]. They are not “karmi[s]” [spiritual practitioners; those who do the spiritual act]. “Maharshi[s]” [great seers] are those who know the three phases of time, who completely know the created cosmos. They too, do not know that state of Mine. Why is it that they [gods and “maharshis”] do not know? Take a look and see why. If you stay with the enquiry into the three phases of time and samsara, then you will have to remain as a practitioner of the dharma of the chitta [dharma of the personal consciousness]. You will not be able to go above. If one wants to go above, the enjoyment of the fruits of karma and the power of enquiry will have to be left behind, and they [karmic fruits and enquiry] will remain in the field of the chitta [personal consciousness]. When you withdrew your “I” from Maya and experienced these [following] things: the revelation of Vivasvan at the field where “I” and Maya separate, and the putting forth of the reflection of Vivasvan onto the chitta – at that time you understood that these experiences cannot be touched by those who follow the dharma of the chitta. That is because these are realities that are far above the chitta. And the True “I” is even above these. It is because you are a “karmi” [spiritual practitioner; doer of the spiritual act] that these [matters above the chitta] were experienced by you through “karma” (Kriya). But, as the “maharshis” are always abiding in matters that bless the world, they do not grasp the state of the Upper “I”. But that does not mean that you should come to the conclusion that they [the “maharshis” – great seers] do not have the ability to grasp That “I”. In any case, “I” Am prior to the great sages and gods."
3,"The one who knows Me to be without beginning and the Supreme Lord of all the worlds – that one, among those of the earthen-world, is without delusion, and is free of all sins.","In this beginning- and end-endowed world, no one and nothing is without beginning. Only “I” AM without beginning – the Original Cause. As the “karmi”’s [spiritual practitioner’s] karma [actions and their fruits] is reduced by doing karma [spiritual practice], as a result of that, that sadhak/karmi comes closer and closer to this “I”. As soon as that sadhak realizes that “I” is different from him/her and that It IS without beginning, right away, that sadhak casts off “moodhatva” [foolishness] (the one who is under the power of desire – that is the one who is “moodha” [stupid; fool; ignorant]), merges with “I”, leaves the dharma of the earthen-world, and knows “I” to be the Great Lord of creation. Thus, the change-bound restlessness (sin) no longer remains. That is because “I” AM the Origin, without birth. There is no appearance of sin in “I”; there is no sin in Me at all."
"04,05","The manifold states that arise in living beings such as “buddhi,” “jnana,” “asammoha,” “kshama,” “satya,” “dama,” “shama,” “sukha,” “duhkha,” “utpatti,” “nasha,” “bhaya,” “abhaya,” “ahimsa,” “samata,” “tushti,” “tapa,” “daan,” “yasha,” “ayasha” etc. all arise from Me. ","“Buddhi” means: the power within the antahkarana [the four-fold personal consciousness] that enables one to discern between truth and untruth [or: good and bad], and thereby allows one to understand the subtler things – meaning: the vritti [functionality] of “making certain/clear [or: making definite].”
 
Jnana – see Chapter 9, sloka 1. That which has been made clear through the enquiry-endowed “buddhi” – to apply that is called “jnana.”
 
Asammoha – “a” = negation + “saṃ” = “samyak” [total] + “moha” = the vritti [functionality] of ignorance. The state in which the vritti of ignorance ends completely – that state is called the state of “asammhoha.”
 
Kshama – the power to be indifferent to praise or derision by others, even if the recipient has the ability to respond – that is “kshama.”
 
Satya – to do good for others without any ulterior motive [of recompense and such].
 
Dama – the control of the external sense-organs.
 
Shama – the control of the antahkarana [the four inner operators of personal consciousness].
 
Sukha – “su” = “sundar” [beautiful]; “khaṃ” = void – meaning: being without anxiety/tension.
 
Duhkha – the opposite of “sukha.”
 
Bhava – birth.
 
Abhava – death.
 
Ahimsa – empathy towards living beings.
 
Samata – the ending of likes and dislikes.
 
Tushti – contentment.
 
Tapa – the effort to burn the mutations of Maya to ashes in the fire of Knowledge/Awareness.
 
Daan – the giving away of one’s properly acquired possessions, as much as is feasible, to worthy recipients. Dear sadhak! See! You are nothing but Brahman [the Absolute]. Even so – the fact that you have taken refuge in Maya, and the fact that, under the power of ego, you have dressed up as “I” and have taken on sound, touch, sight, taste and smell – these forms are your “properly acquired” “dhana” [wealth]. “Dhana” [wealth] – “dha” = “dharana” [concentration]; “na” = negation/annihilation – to be devoid of concentration is called “dhana.” [When there is focus on “dhana”] the mind cannot be concentrated [on the Self], because of being in the worldly experiences of sound and such; only restlessness is there. That is why these [worldly experiences] are called “dhana” [wealth]. All of this wealth of yours – all of these are “asat” [non-truth], because they are limited. To give away all of these to worthy recipients – meaning: to surrender them to the Limitless Parambrahman is called “daan” [giving away] (see “brahmaNAdhyaya” Chapter 5, sloka 10) – meaning: upon having cast off desires, forgetting the separate existence of those things through the practice of meditation on Brahman, and seeing Brahman in all – that is “daan.”
 
Yasha – renown from doing righteous deeds.
 
Ayaha – infamy from doing non-righteous deeds.
 
These [aforementioned things] are in the marketplace of “bhoota” [phenomena/living beings] – meaning: they exist for those who follow the dharma of the antahkarana [personal consciousness]. That is why these are called “bhoota-bhava” [the states of the “bhootas”]. Although these states arise from “I”, they are variegated – meaning: of different kinds. “That” which is the state of “I” or the State of the Self – there is no sense of separateness in that. “That” is One without a second. This is the reason that the states of the “bhootas” are completely opposite to the State of the Self."
6,"The seven personages – “Marichi” [an immortal sage] and such – and the four “maharshis” [great seers] such as “Sanaka” [a mind-born sage] from the past, and the personages of the “Manus” [progenitors of humanity] such as “Svayambhu” [the first “Manu”] all get their power from Me and come forth from My Mind – all of these ones from whom all of the participants of creation have been created.","“Mahat” is Consciousness/Spirit as it is present within Maya – meaning: “Ishvara” [God as a separate Being]. The one who has attained this state of “Mahat” through the power of sadhana [spiritual practice] – that is the one who is called “maharshi” [the one who has attained “Mahat”]. In this present “Vaivasvata Manavantara” [name of the current aeon], seven beings have attained that state. Their names are: Marichi, Atri, Angira, Pulasta, Pulaha, Kratu and Vashishtha. And in some places it is said that the maharshis of the Vaivasvata Manavantara are: Kashyap, Atri, Vashishtha, Vishvamitra, Gautam [not Gautam the Buddha], Jamadagni and Bharadvaj. The four beings from the primordial times are: Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatkumar and Sanatan. The fourteen Manus [progenitors of humanity] are: Svayambhuva [also called Svayambhu], Svarochisha, Uttama, Tamasa, Vaivata, Chakshusha, Vaivasvata (this Vaivasvata Manavantara [aeon] is the current one), Savarni, Dakshasavarni, Brahmasavarni, Dharmasavarni, Rudrasavarni, Devasavarni and Indrasavarni. All of these ones are born of imagination-power of My Mind – meaning: the particular vritti [functionality] that is called “manas” [mind] — Begin Footnote. —  “Manas” [mind] – to accept. To accept something is “manas” – the power of desire — End Footnote. — that arises within My State of Being, all of these ones have arisen in that Mind. All of these beings are endowed with My State of Being – meaning: they are adepts of My “Vaishnavi” (omnipresence). They are “prajapati” [lords of the created world]. It is from them that the innumerable living beings have spread out throughout creation."
7,The one who comes to know about all of these Glories/Manifestations of Mine as well as yogic truths (the adeptness in the manifestations of yoga) – that one becomes united to unwavering yoga. There is no doubt about this.,"This creation-vritti [creation-functionality] of Mine, this dissolution-vritti [of Mine] (addition [creation] and subtraction [dissolution]), and the “Kaivalya Sthiti” [Reality of Only-ness] that is before creation and after dissolution – these three together make up My “vibhuti-yoga.” “Vibhuti” [glories; divine manifestations/happenings; miracles] = extraordinary kind of manifestation. The extraordinary aspect is that there are millions and millions of microcosms in the form of living beings in the macrocosm. And “yoga” is to gather up those “vibhuti” [divine manifestations] and merge [in the Self]. One who witnesses these two [vibhuti and yoga] while [at the same time] being aware of the manifested experience – meaning: the time just before the dissolution that happens by the power of sadhana, when the state of being under the power of Prakriti is still there – the one who, in that state, sees this creation and the grand sport of this creation – for that being, at the time of dissolution – meaning: at the time of merging with “I” – there is no more taste for dancing about in the lusts for enjoyments. Thus, one falls into “I”, and there is the attainment of “Kaivalya” [Only-ness]. No shifting about happens in That. This is a statement that is without doubt."
8,"I, indeed, am the cause of all manifestations, and it is from Me that all proceeds. Knowing this, the knowledgeable ones, in their meditative states, worship Me.","“Aham” – “I” – “Paramatman” [Supreme Self]; “sarva” [all] – the garland-narrative of creation, from Brahmaa [the creator] to stones and all there is throughout creation. “Budh” [knowledgeable one; the planet Mercury] – the planet that is closest to the Sun – that is “Budh.” Thus the light of the Sun falls more on Budh. Similarly, the one who, through discriminatory-awareness, always keeps the company of the Supreme Self – that being is also “Budh” [receiving the Knowledge of the Self] – “viveki” [spiritually discerning one]. When this discrimination/discernment is attained, the sadhak [spiritual practitioner] becomes aware that “I” AM the source of all – the Cause of manifestation, and whatever states that are taking place in all living beings/phenomena such as “buddhi,” “jnana,” “asammoha” etc. [see slokas 10:4-5] – are all happening from this “I”. “I” am the One and Only refuge of all as well as their Operator. When this type of knowing happens, one is united to the State of the Self, and does the worship of “I” alone – meaning: there is no desire at all to take recourse/refuge in anything except “I”; one makes effort with the whole of life, mind and heart to just merge with That “I”. "
9,"Having put mind and life on Me (those “budh[s]” [knowledgeable ones; see commentary to sloka 10:8 above for spiritual explanation]), teach each other about the matters of “I”, and conversing always about the matters of “I”, attain contentment and happiness.","At the time of dissolution, “mind-ness” does not remain in Maya; it enters into “I”. And therefore, the life-force that is usually connected to life in the world – that too, along with “mind-ness,” enters into “I”. This is because at that time Maya has no power of action. For this reason, the duality of the “other” comes to an end. If there is anyone there to say anything at that time, and if that being says anything – in that case, because that being is Alone, that being will say, “I AM ‘I’.” This “I” is, verily, the Eternal. All that is to be had has been had (because everything has merged into “I”), and because of this, there is no wanting for attaining or having. Joy is Itself enjoying Joy. Purush and Prakriti becoming one is that which is called “raman” [Divine Romance; Divine Delight]. And that is what is happening here."
10,"Those who are ever-united in yoga, and worship Me with love, I bestow upon them that “buddhi-yoga” (jnana [spiritual knowledge]), by which, they attain Me.","Those who enjoy that happiness of the Bliss of Brahman at all times – because of being under the Power of Love, they do not want to ever let go of “I”; they worship [“I”]. Thus, I take their minds and merge them into “I” and make them “I”, and thus, they become “I”."
11,"Those who meditate [upon Me] in the aforementioned way – out of compassion, I live in their beings, and by the Luminous Lamp of Knowledge/Awareness, I destroy the darkness born of ignorance.","By the Grace of “I”, for the spiritual practitioner of this kind, the ignorance-bound mutations of Maya are destroyed. This is because that sadhak has become Still in the State of the Self, and thus the Light from the State of the Self permeates that practitioner’s inner being."
"12,13","Arjuna said: “You are ‘Parambrahman,’ ‘Param dham,’ ‘Param pavitra’; (for this reason) sages such as ‘Bhrigu’ etc., the divine sage ‘Narada,’ ‘Asit,’ ‘Deval’ and ‘Vyasa’ – all of them speak of You as ‘Shashvata,’ ‘Divya,’ ‘Purush,’ ‘Adideva,’ ‘Aja,’ and ‘Vibhu.’ You ‘Svayam’ are also telling me this.”","(In seven slokas – [10:]12 to [10:]18 – Arjuna, upon praising the Lord in hymn, is asking about knowing His Glorious Manifestations fully.) The knowledge that takes one to the shores beyond – that is what is known as “param.” “BrahmavidyApnoti param” – meaning: the one who is a knower of Brahman – that being comes to this “param” and comes to realize what kind of state this is. “Brahman” is the Limitless Great. This is also [being called] a “state.” It is being called a “state” only because if it is not called a “state,” it is not easy to explain all of these things nor is it easy to understand this matter. The knowledge that takes one to the shores beyond, the abiding place for that knowledge is called “Param Dham” [the Supreme Abode] – meaning: the state of enjoying the Bliss of Brahman. “Pavitram” [Pure] – a state devoid of toxicity. “Paramam” is the state of abidance after the life span of Brahmaa [creator aspect] is finished (when vibration ends). This is also a state. “Purusham” – the One Who is laying still in the abode of Maya – that is the One Who is “Purush.” “Shashvatam” [Immaculate] = One Who is never destroyed. “Divyam” [Divine] – means the space-like Form of the Self. Just as you cannot hold on to space, similarly your “You-state” cannot be held. That is why You are “Divyam.”
 
“Adideva” – the place from which the first beginning happens – that is “adi.” The beginning of this creation is from You. Thus, You are “Adideva” [God of Origin].
 
“Aja” means the One Who is never born. That is also that “You.” “Vibhu” means One Who is ever-unbound and ever-present in everything and everyone – meaning: the One Who is Omnipresent. That is also You.
 
All of these states are established in You. That is why You are “Bhavan” [the Universe] – meaning: that it is You Who actually are all of these states – I get to know this in that state, the state where every word is known with its cause, form and meaning. That is what is known as the state of “rishi” [sagaciousness]. “Ṛshayah sarve” [all seeing; seeing in all].
 
“Devarshi Narada” [divine sage Narada]: “Nara” means “Vishnu”; “da” means “daan” [giving]. The one who enables one to have Vishnu – that being is the one who is called “Narada” (see Chapter 10, sloka 26 [of the Gita]).
 
“Asit” – “a” = negation; “sit” = bound. One Who is not bound – it is He Who is called “Asit” – meaning: the state of being Free is the state of “Asit.”
 
“Deval” – “deva” = “devata” [divine being], and “lam” = the seed of the earth element. The state where the inner mind plays with the gods of the earthen-world – meaning: remains engrossed in the worship of form. It is that state that is called the state of “Deval.”
 
“Vyasa” – segmented knowledge – meaning: the one who, for the benefit of the world of living beings, divided the river of knowledge in the form of the Vedas (under the names: Sama, Rik, Yaju and Atharva), and for those with a lesser ability to grasp, created the Form-worship-oriented Puranas [spiritual mythologies], thereby making it possible to be on the path of Liberation – that is the one who is “Vyasa” ([it is] a state of being).
 
And “Svayam” [“I” as “I AM”]? That is the paravastha of Kriya! After being in this state, I come down, make the “I” into “you” and I understand these experiential states of Mine that I am experiencing. And again after coming down, I am coming to know that when My state of Rishi, state of Narada, state of Asit, state of Deval, state of Vyasa and state of Svayam happened – at that time, it seems that this knowledge: that the Upper “I” Myself Am “Parambrahman” [Supreme Absolute], “Param dham,” “Pavitra,” “Param Purush,” “Shashvata,” “Divya,” “Adideva,” “Aja” and “Vibhu” – this knowledge that I have seen, experienced and understood – it seems that it is “You” who is speaking about this [because of my having come down from Upper “I”]."
14,"O Keshava [Sri Krishna]! That which You are telling me – I believe all of that to be true. Indeed, O Bhagavan [Divine One; Sri Krishna]! Even the gods do not know Your Presence (the Cause of Manifestation), and neither do the demons.","“Keshava” – “ka” = Brahmaa, the creator + “eesha” = the destroyer + “va” = void. When this power of creation and the power of destruction become the Void, when they merge and become One – meaning: the Permanent State that is devoid of creation and destruction – that is the state that is called “Keshava.” When, after experiencing this state, I came down – at that time, whatever it is that “He” said up above – He had me accept all of that. That “Keshava-state” – that cannot be known by anyone other than “karmis” [spiritual practitioners] (Kriya-devoted ones), regardless of being in the state of “gods” who enjoy the fruits of karma [actions and their fruits] or being the lust-bound, ignorant/stupid ones in the state of “demons.” And because all of those glories are established in You, You are “Bhagavan” [Divine One; the Lord]."
15,O “Purushottama!” O “Bhootabhavana!” O “Bhootesha!” O “Devadeva!” O “Jagatpate” – You Yourself know Yourself by Yourself. ,"“Bhootabhavana” = the Nourisher of “bhoota[s]” [living beings; phenomena; elements]; “Bhootesha” = the Deliverer of “bhootas”; “Devadeva” = the God of gods; “Jagatpati” [spelled with an “i” here for grammatical declension] – the Husband of Creation. “Purushottama” – The Prakritic veil is “pur” [abode]. Among these states that are there after the Prakritic veil is united [with the Self] – the state that is highest among them, above which there is no more “state” – That is “Purushottama.” How Glorious is Purush! And all of this is You! Lord! Lord! And now You are Me! That is why I am saying, I Myself am the Knower, I Myself am the Known, and I Myself am the Knowing. "
16,"Tell me how You are present with all of these manifestations throughout all of the planes. Tell me about all of Your manifestations, completely.","That state of Kaivalya [Only-ness] that is there up above – that state that pervades the Cosmos, all phenomena and souls – anything about this cannot be spoken about after coming down [from there]. Yet, the continuous intoxication of the “I”-State does not go away either. In this kind of state, there is a time that one forgets the merging of the limited into the Unlimited. And because of the power of previous impressions, it is as if spontaneously (helplessly) a “You” forms in the “I”. That is what forces the sadhak to say, “That sky-covering Glory that is You – the fact that You have dressed up everything in creation as different ‘you’s’ – and at the same time, You are present in all of it – tell me about all of that without exception. Don’t leave anything out!” This means: the sadhak prepares him/herself to compare the states of everything outside to the sadhak’s own inner states and destroy all doubts."
17,O Yogi [Sri Krishna]! In what way can I contemplate You at all times and get to know You? O Lord! In which “bhaav[s]” (things) will You appear in my contemplation?,"In what way can I contemplate You at all times and get to know Your Yogic State? It is seen in sadhana: as long as there is chitta-dharma [dharma of personal consciousness], that yogi-state never comes. The word “bhaav” [state] itself refers to that yogi-state. But O Lord! How and to which “bhaav” will I merge my contemplation? Contemplation cannot reach “bhaav” [spiritual state] at all and in any way. So then in which states will You be the matter of contemplation?"
18,"O Janardan [Sri Krishna]! Tell me again about Your Yogic Glories and Your Vast Nature, because even after hearing the nectarous words from Your mouth, I am still not satisfied.","That Self, that Pureness, that Self-Luminescence, that Sovereign-ness, that Non-doing/Formless State of Yoga – O Source of life and death! Tell me again about those Glories and Manifestations of Yours, fully and completely. Make me understand again. I am not satisfied by the little amount of that State that I have experienced."
19,"The Lord said with great emphasis, “O best of the Kurus [Arjuna]! I will now tell you [only] about the primary Manifestations of Mine, because there is no end to My Glory.”","Again, through one’s own Awareness, the previously mentioned queries are being resolved – meaning: one is spontaneously answering one’s own questions by Oneself.
 
“Kurushreshtha” [the best of the Kurus] – the word “kuru” refers to “doing.” Its purport: someone does the work, and the reaper of the fruits is another. It is the same here. Prakriti did the work; the one who fell into bondage is [lesser] “I” (jiva [individual consciousness]). Why? Because I am in “Kurukshetra” [the field of Kuru; the field of work/karma]. From the Manipur to the Muladhar is the “Kurukshetra” of the path of sadhana [spiritual practice]. (See the commentary to slokas 14-15 in Chapter 3 [of the Pranab Gita].) The sadhak for whom there is still the sporting about of lust, anger, greed and delusion/attachment in the area from the Manipur to the Muladhar – that sadhak is referred to as “kuru.” The “best/highest” one among them is the one who has nevertheless attained the right to go above the Ajna-chakra – meaning: this sadhak is not able to let go of lust, anger, greed, delusion/attachment, pride and envy; yet, at the same time, he/she is also connected to the attainments of knowing the Self: spiritual seeing, spiritual hearing, contemplation and absorption. This sadhak has this kind of state of being. That is why this sadhak is being called “kurushreshtha” [the best of the sadhaks who are still in the field of samsara].
 
That Divine Opulence of Mine – meaning: like the endless waves, foam and bubbles in water, so is the manifestation of the Self in the drama of the Cosmos – it has no end. This is because I AM Infinite. That which can be known about Me, is also Infinite, Vast. But, now, I am telling you about some of the most primary ones [Manifestations; Glories].
"
20,"O Gudakesh [Arjuna]! I AM the Self within all things/living beings. I AM the Beginning of all phenomena/living beings – meaning: the Creator, the Middle – meaning: the Sustainer, and the End – meaning: the Destroyer.","“Gudakesh” – “guDAkA” = sleep; “eesha” = deliverance; one who has conquered sleep. The sadhak who cannot be attacked by sleep, the sadhak who is ever awake – that is the one who is “Gudakesh.” “Aham” = “I”, the Self – the Lord of all phenomena and living beings – meaning: the tanmatras [sources of the senses] come from “I”-ness [ego]; space and such elements have come forth from the tanmatras. That is why the “ashay” [abode] or ruler of all phenomena/living beings is called “atma” [self]. “Ashay” means “place.” Wherever one stays, that is that one’s “ashay.” Just as the “ashay” of water is the sea, similarly the “ashay” of phenomena/living beings is “I”. It is from “I” that the phenomena/living beings arise, and again, it is in “I” that phenomena/living beings end. And then again, the middle between this beginning and end is also in “I”. Therefore, the emergence-preservation-destruction of creation is happening on “I”, from “I” and within “I”. "
21,"Among the “Adityas,” I am “Vishnu,” among all lights, the “Angshumali” Sun, and among the “Maruts,” I am “Marichi.” Among the celestial bodies, I am “Chandra” [Moon].","“Aditya” – the one by whom all lack is fulfilled – that one is “Aditya.” The reflected light of Consciousness that shines at the junction area of Mahat and Avyakta – because that [reflection] is called the first manifestation of Maya, it is named “Aditya” [the first]. Through the use of sambhavi, this Aditya can be seen in twelve parts. They are: “Bhaga,” “Angsha,” “Aryama,” “Mitra,” “Varuna,” “Savita,” “Dhata,” “Vivasvan,” “Tashta,” “Pusha,” “Indra” and “Vishnu.” Among these twelve, it is “Vishnu” Who is “savitṛmaNDalamadhyavartee nArAyaNah hiraNmayavapu” [Lord Narayana in Golden Form situated in the center of the sun-like orb]. In that Heart of that Inner Aditya [see second sentence of this commentary] – meaning: when the Star that is in exactly the middle [of the radiance] bursts – the eight-petaled lotus that is seen after that – it is above that lotus that the Golden Person is seen. The color that comes forth when melted gold is stirred – that Person’s color is just like that. That is why the name “Hiranmaya” [golden] is used. He is “hiraNyashmashru” [with golden beard] and “hiraNyakesha” [golden-haired]. His nails and everything is golden in Him. — Begin Footnote. — “atha yadevaitadAtyasya shuklaṃ bhAh saiva sAtha yanneelaṃ parah kṛShNaṃ tadamastatsAmAtha ya eSho’ntarAditye hiraNmayah puruSho dṛshyate hiraNyashmashrurhiraNyakesha ApraNasvAtsarva eva suvarNah.” Chhandogya Upanishad; 1st Chapter. 1.6.6. — End footnote. — It is He Who is Vishnu. That Vishnu is verily, “I” – meaning: the first mutation of Ancient Mahamaya.

The one that is “Angshumali Ravi” [radiant sun] (“raṃ” – revelation/light; “i” – power; “vaṃ” – space/void; the power that brings light in the void) in the zodiac – “I” am that as well. “Marut” [air/wind] (“m” – dying + “ut” [pulled out]) – meaning: pulling this one out causes death. Among the “Maruts,” “I” am “Marichi” – meaning: prana [life-force].
 
“Nakshatra” [ordinary definition: star; celestial body] – meaning: that which has no destruction [when the word “nakshatra” is broken down etymologically, the meaning is that which cannot be destroyed] – meaning: “amrita” [nectar of immortality; ambrosia]. This nectar is in “Shashi” [Moon]. That is why “I” am the Moon."
22,"Among all of the vedas I am the Sama Veda. Among the gods I am “Vasav” [also known as “Indra”]. I am the mind among the sense-organs, and I am consciousness within living beings and phenomena.","Veda = jnana [knowledge]; whatever there is to be known – that is “Veda.” Among the vedas, the Sama Veda is the joining point – the coming together of Maya and Brahman. Its [Sama Veda’s] place is the Ajna-chakra (see commentary to Chapter 2, sloka 5 [of the Pranab Gita]). There is complete revelation here. That is why, among the vedas, “I” am Sama Veda.
 
VAsav[a] [head of the demi-gods; Indra] – “vAs” + “av[a]” – meaning: the one who resides in heaven – he is Vasav. “Svarga” [heaven; levels] means “level[s].” There are two levels in creation. One is of bondage, and the other is of Freedom. Between these two, there is an aisle called “chitta” [higher mind; personal consciousness]. In the level below chitta, due to the dominance of the three gunas, there is the bound “jiva-ness” [personal entity-ness]. From below, however much one progresses [upwards] towards the veil of chitta, that much freedom from “jiva-ness” does that person experience. And again, there are two more levels above chitta. There is a level between chitta and Vivasvan [see commentary to Chapter 4:1-2 of the Pranab Gita], and there is another level above Vivasvan. Above the chitta is the residing place for those who are still controlled [by lower powers]. Some are controlled by chitta, some by Prakriti, some by Maya – like this. These beings can go about both above and below chitta, yet they are not bound like jivas [samsaric souls]. However, they do not have the power or right to go to the level above Vivasvan. And[, among these beings who can go above and below chitta,] those who are below – even those who are residents of the levels of ego, intellect, mind, senses, worldly experiences etc. are also called “swarga- [heaven-] dwellers.” It is seen like this: the worldly person in the worldly experience, the “muni” [mental sage] in the mind, the Buddhist in buddhi [intellect], the “ahamkari” [I-worshipper] (follower of “so’hang/so’ham” [I am That]) etc. Among them, one who is residing in chitta but has attained the power to go above chitta and has established him/herself somewhat higher – it is that being that is called “Indra” or “Vasav.” The state above Ajna is the karma-less state of enjoying the fruits, or the state of the gods. Whatever kinds of “states of the gods” that the “I” has – among them, that “Vasav-state” is primary. The full manifestation of “I” in the “states of the gods” is in “Vasav.” That is why it has been said, “I am ‘Vasav.’”
 
IndriyANAṃ manashchAsmi – among the sense-organs, I am “mind.” There are eleven sense-organs. Five are the organs of perception. These take the outer experiences of sound, touch, sight, taste and scent and bring it to “I”. Five are organs of action. The organs of action make the “I” – which is made restless by the worldly experiences of sight, taste and such – do work outside. Besides these, there is another sense-organ. That organ is called “mind.” This mind makes the “I” experience the worldly life and makes it do work as well – meaning: activating desire, feeling, thought – all of these things within – makes one run about with actions outside. The true form of this bi-directional sense-organ is verily that which is known as “mind.” And “I” am that.
 
Mana [mind] – “ma” = “I” + “na” = “am not” – meaning: “I am not.” The “I” that is among the sense-organs – that is the “false ‘I’.” But among these, the mind that is “I am not” – that [“I am not”] is the real “I”. Now let us see which mind is the “I am not”-mind among the aggregate of the sense-organs.
 
Indriya [sense-organs] – “i” + “ndra” + “i” + “ya”; “i” = power; “ndra” = fire; “i” = power; “ya” = something that is itself. In “indriya[s]” [sense-organ[s]], “fire-power” and “power-itself” are found. The nature of “fire-power” is this: whatever falls into fire, fire transforms that into its own form and quality. Whatever fire touches – fire first illuminates that thing, then it makes it heated, and in the end what remains is only a sign/remnant – blackness and ashes. Similarly, whichever worldly experience comes and falls into the fire-power of the sense-organs – first that experience is illuminated within [experienced]; then a pressure or movement is felt; and later only a samksara [impression] of that worldly experience remains. Here we have seen one part of “indriya,” the work of  “fire-power” or “indra.” Now let us see the work of the other part – “iya” or “power-itself.”
 
In all of the workings of each of the sense-organs, the experience “I am doing; I am seeing” – this kind of thing that is happening – the “I” that is in this – that is the “false ‘I’.” This “I” is endowed with beginningless samskaras. It is this “I” that experiences pleasure and pain, health and illness, old age and death. It is this “I” that, having fallen into seeing and hearing and such, that is ever growing and ever being nurtured, and being a happy or sad one. But the “power-itself” that accompanies “fire-power” – meaning: the “i” + “ya” that is enjoined there [in the sense organs] – that has no change. That [“power-itself”] does not hold anything or anyone, nor does it cast off anyone or anything. This “power-itself” ever presides in state of Stillness and Peace. This “power-itself” is not “I”, instead, because there is nothing in this “power-itself” that knows itself as “I”, this “power-itself” is called “I am not” – or “mind.”
 
The reason for calling this “power-itself” “I am not” or “mind” is this: “fire-power” or the “false ‘I’” goes around being restless at all times due to being with falsehood. If there was no “power-itself” or the still “I” at the root of “fire-power” – if there is no unmoving thing at the root of every movement, then on what will the waves float? Similarly, the game of the “false ‘I’” – the beginningless current of the breaking down and building up of the samskara-bundles – is taking place on top of the “power-itself” in the form of “I am not.” All pleasure and pain are in this [“false ‘I’” or “fire-power”]. However, at the root is the real “I” – the still, peaceful “power-itself.” That which people say “I”, “I”, to which they become attached, and for which they become overcome by grief – that is the “false ‘I’.” Thus, it is being said here that among the senses, it is “mind” or the “I am not” that is the real “I”. [Translators’ note: The following two sentences are difficult to understand unless one knows the Sanskrit alphabet, its specific sounds and their energetic purport. It is being translated here as is, so that the work is true to the original.] The short “i” – representing the lesser power – is being used here because [the Lord] is speaking about the Divine Manifestations in the particular. If the Manifestations were spoken about in the macrocosmic sense, the greater power would have been represented.
 
BhootAnAmasmi chetanA – I am the consciousness in living beings and phenomena. “Bhoot” – that which goes. Everything in creation that can be seen, heard, done, felt – all of that goes away. Nothing stays. All of that is “bhoot” [phenomena; past]. All of that is Prakriti. All of that is material. Within them, “I” am “chetana” [consciousness]. “Chetana” – “chet” + “a” + “na.” “Chet” means “if” – meaning: uncertain. What is uncertain? Oh but “a”. “A” means “asat” [false; bad; wrongness] – meaning: whatever is of the six attributes such as “asti jAyate” etc. [see footnote 5 in Chapter 8 of the Pranab Gita] – all of that. And “na” means “not.” Therefore, the word “chetana” means whatever is not of the uncertain, not of the six-attribute-endowed – that. In other words, the Certain Thing is “I”."
23,"Among the “Rudras,” I am “Shankar”; among the “yakshas” and “rakshas,” I am “Kubera”; among the “vasus,” I am “Agni”; and among the mountains I am “Sumeru.”","RudrANAṃ shankarashchAsmi – among the “Rudras” I am Shankar. There are 11 rudras. They are: “Aja,” “Ekapada,” “Ahirbradhna,” “Pinaki,” “Rita,” “Pitrirupa,” “Tryambaka,” “Vrishakapi,” “Shambhu,” “Havan” and “Ishvara.”
 
When the sadhak comes to know the [alphabet] letters in the six lotuses – at that time the sadhak sees “da,” “ya,” “pa” and “u” – these four yonis – meaning: places of abidance. The place of “da” is in the middle area between the Muladhar and Svadhisthan – at the abode of desire. The place of “ya” is in the Anahata-chakra. The place of “pa” is above the Vishuddha and below the Ajna – at the “mastak granthi.” [See Introduction, Section 5.] And the place of “u” is at the Sahasrar.
 
“Rudra” = “ra” + “u” + “da” + “ra”. “Ra” = the fire-seed; “u” = the place of settledness at Sahasrar; “da” = the yoni at the abode of desire [see above paragraph]. Therefore, the One in Whom (the Holding Place in Which) there is the fire of desire as well as the fire of mercy – in their fully manifested forms – that is the One Who is “Rudra.” Among the Rudras, I am “Shankar.” “Shang” [“ng” is the root form] – meaning: the One Who bestows Beneficence – meaning: the One Who is Only Blessing Itself. “I” AM That.
 
Vittesho yaksharakshasAm – “vitta” means the Directing Shakti [Divine Power]. This Power is divided into four parts. The first part is in the earth-element; the second part is in water; the third part is in fire; and the fourth part is merged into the sages and saints. This is the One Who is named: “Padmaa,” “Lakshmi,” “Bhooti,” “Shree,” “Shraddhaa,” “Medhaa,” “Sannati,” “Vijitaa,” “Sthiti,” “Dhriti,” “Siddhi,” “Svadhaa,” “Niyati” and “Smriti.” Whatever good or bad thing you see in this world – that thing will make you entranced. That Entrancing Power – it is She Who is the Vishnu-Maya. Because She is within everything and everyone, and She is known only through the observation of everything and everyone other than Her, no one can actually see or know Her movements. That is why She is called the Ruling Goddess of “Alakapur” [the abode[s] of certain spirits] – meaning: all of the abodes that exist from the Supreme Particle to Maya – this sattva-guna-endowed Great Shakti is the Decorator of all of those abodes. (“Al” = to clothe; decorate.) “DikpAl” – “dig” [“g” is the root form] – meaning: those who can be brought to settlement – the Directress of this activity. “Kubera” [the lord of wealth] protects this Goddess. She is Kubera’s possession. That is why “Kubera” is named “Vittesha” [having the Directing Power]. Even this bit of the game of Maya is happening in “I”. Thus, “I” am “Vittesha” [“Kubera”].
 
VasunAṃ pAvakashchAsmi [among the “vasus” I am fire] – “vasu” means “that which reveals/illuminates – meaning: the one whose energy/light energizes/illuminates another. The “vasus” are eight. They are: “Bhava,” “Dhruva,” “Soma,” “Vishnu,” “Anal,” “Anil,” “Pratyush” and “Prabhav.” “Pavak” means “Anal” [fire] or “Agni” [fire] – the one who purifies. Coming to “I”, everyone is purified; thus, “I” am “Pavak” [Purifier].
 
MerushikhariNAham [I am “Meru” among the peaks] – “Shikhari” means “mountains” – meaning: high places. Among them, “Meru” is the highest. Now, dear sadhak, take a look within. Above the Vivasvan part of Maya is “I”."
24,"O Partha [Arjuna]! Know Me to be “Brihaspati,” the Premier among the priests. It is I Who am “Kartik” among the soldiers, and among the bodies of water I am the ocean.","The word “purodhas” [see first line of sloka above] means “purohit” [priest] – meaning: the one who is the holder, from the beginning. (The work/rite cannot be accomplished simply with the power of pure kshatriyas [caste of kings and warriors]. Along with the power of kshatriyas, the power of Brahman is necessary. It is for this reason that the protectors of kings – meaning: the holders of their righteousness – are priests. Thus, by the use of the word “purodhas,” this is meant: “the one who is holding from the beginning.” This is shown by the fact that the protective rites such as fire offerings and such are done by the priests.) The One Who is holding is holding Maya itself. This Maya is “brihat” [the “big”]. The “pati” [husband] of this “brihat” is “Brihaspati.” When the Knowledge of Brahman arose in the Royal Sage Janaka, he spoke out like this, “Lo! How wondrous I AM! I Myself bow to Me. There is no one who has accomplished what I have, as even without touching this body, I am eternally sustaining/holding the Cosmos-Body.” — Begin Footnote. — “Aho ahaṃ namo mahyaṃ dasksho nasti hi matsamah; asaṃspṛshyashareereNa yena vishvaṃ chiraṃ dhṛtam.” - Ashtavakra Samhita, sloka 2:13. — End Footnote. — Thus, among the priests, I am the Premier Brihaspati. Know this. Here, among “jiva” [individual], “Ishvara” [personal God] and “I”, “I” am the Primary One. — Begin Footnote. — Dear sadhak. Look. The jiva [individual] is “purodhas” [priest], the Reflection [personal God] in the chitta [personal consciousness] is also “purodhas” and “I” am also “purodhas.” Among these three “I” am the Primary One. — End Footnote. —

SenAneenAmahaṃ skandah [among the soldiers I am “Skanda” [Kartik]]. “Sena” [soldier[s]] means people – meaning: those who have been born. All of them are fighting with these two things: “me” and “mine.” This battle – its director is “vasana” [embedded desire]. “Vasa” [residing] happens in the yoni [place of abidance] – meaning: the one who is in the place of abidance, that one is “vasana.” This “vasana” is the aggregate of soldiers. “Skanda[h]” = “sa” + “ka” + “na” + “da” + “:” [this is not a “colon”; this is the symbol of visarga which symbolizes extinguishing and concluding words and sounds with an added aspirated sound to the original word, like adding an “h”] (“s”). The adjoining of this “s” shows half-becoming [almost getting there]. “Sa” = subtle breath; “ka” = head; “na” = negation; not; “da” = yoni. Therefore, it [the meaning of “Skanda”] is this: the time when one has taken the subtlest of subtle breaths up to the head through the void-yoni, and is only awaiting Freedom – meaning: when “vasana” [desire] no longer moves about in all kinds of ways below and has let go of all vibration, and is one-pointedly focused on Emancipation and going that way – the state that happens at that time – that is called “Skanda.” This state and the “I” have a close transference with each other. That is why “visarga” (: [signifying the “h” sound]) is enjoined. That is why “I” am “Skandah.” (See Chapter 8, sloka 3 regarding “visarga.”)
 
SarasAsmi sAgarah – “sarasAṃ” – “sa” + “ra” + “sa” + “Aṃ”; “sa” = subtle breath; “ra” = revelatory light; revelation; “sa” = subtle breath”: “Aṃ” = “aasakti” = addiction. In the revelatory light of the subtle breath, an addiction to the subtle breath happens. Dear sadhak! See! That addiction becomes the ocean. “SAgara” [ocean] – “sA” = addiction to the subtle breath; “gara” = poison – meaning: that addiction spreads like poison. Just by putting attention on exhalation and inhalation, the out-breaths and in-breaths become gradually smaller and smaller until there is a state of the stoppage of breathing. At that time, that limitation-bound subtleness gradually disappears and transforms into unlimited subtleness. At that time, that very unlimited subtleness is “asmi” [am] – meaning: “I”. This is of the inner. And outside, whatever water there is – canal, swamp, creek, pond, tributary, river – whatever – all water is of the sea. And those forms are just fragments of the form of the sea, but limited. The sea is borderless, boundless. That is why as far as the forms of water, it is in the sea that there is the full manifestation of “I”."
25,"I am “Bhrigu” among the “maharshi[s],” the single syllable [OM] in speech/words/sounds, “japayajna” among “yajna[s]” and “Himalaya” among “sthavar[s].”","“Maharshi[s]” ([see] Chapter 10, sloka 6) are the ones who have attained all of the divine powers through the power of sadhana. Among them, I am “Bhrigu.” “Bhri” = to fill; and “gu” = darkness. Nothing is discernible in darkness. For this reason, sagacious personages refer to ignorance as “darkness.” In comparison to the Awareness of Brahman, the happenings of karma [action] is this ignorance. Thus, even after attaining divine powers through the power of sadhana, the one who still goes about in the happenings of karma [action] – that is the person who is called “Bhrigu.” But even though that sage is playing around in the happenings of karma [action], “Bhrigu” is never separated from the Awareness of Brahman. The one who, without ever separating, remains absorbed in the Awareness of Brahman – that great sage is, verily, “I”. Because the happenings of karma [action] and the State of Brahman-Knowledge are both present in Bhrigu, among “maharshis” [see beginning of this commentary], “I” am “Bhrigu.”
 
“Gira” means speech/words/sounds.  In all speech/words/sounds, My speech/word/sound is the single syllable Pranava [OM]. Thus, among speech/words/sounds, “I” verily am the Pranava [OM].
 
YajnAnAṃ japayajno’smi [among yajnas I am the “japayajna”; see last sentence of this paragraph] – among “yajnas” [spiritual acts] I am the “ajapa-japa” [automatic inner recitation of mantra] yajna, and it is by this that the Settledness in Brahman is attained. To offer “saphalya” [particular oblations for attainment; definition follows] in fire in order to attain something is called “yajna.” (Sesame, barley, rice paddy [rice with husk] and ghee mixed together is called “saphalya.”) To fill the stomach with food is also called “yajna.” The putting out through the out-breath and the taking in through the in-breath – these together are also called “yajna.” There are many types of yajnas in the world. Among them, I am the yajna of “ajapa” [source-less recitation of mantra]. “Japa” [recitation of mantra from a source] is that which (by the practice of which) the practitioner of the japa is made one with the Beloved Deity. This statement is about the inner. In the exterior, the separated-state that exists between the sadhak and “I” – the ending of this separation via guru-instructed Kriya, and the state of “svayamevaAtmanAmAnam” [knowing Oneself by Oneself] that comes about – that is what is called “japayajna” [inner spiritual practice being the yajna].
 
SthAvarANAṃ himAlayah [among “sthavar[s]” [immovables], I am “Himalaya”] – “sthavar” means that which never moves. The word “stha” means “established.” The word “var” means the greatest/highest – meaning: among all of the highest places of settledness (the repose for the sadhak) that there are, [I am] Himalaya among them. “Him” means “coolness/cold” (where there is no heat; restlessness is heat itself); “alaya” means “house/home” – meaning: living where there is no anxiety/disturbance. “A” [long version] = void; “la” = limitation. That which is immovable, unwavering, still, peaceful, calm and cool, devoid of limitation – that is what is called “Himalaya.” And “I” Am That."
26,"Among “vrikshas” [trees], I am “ashvattha” [peepul tree; a type of fig tree], among “devarshis” [divine sages], “Narada,” among “gandharvas” [celestial beings], “Chitrarath,” and among the “siddhas” [perfected beings] I am “Kapil Muni.”","“Ashvattha” – “a” + “shva” + “ta” + “tha”. “A” [short version] = negation; “shva” = the dawn of tomorrow. Thus, “Ashva” means that which has no time, that which is endless and beginning-less. “Ta” = “taran” or crossing over; “tha” = the five pranas, five deities, three powers, and three bindus, all of which are part of Kundalini Shakti Maya. That Endless and Beginning-less Reality which is beyond this Maya – that is “ashvattha.” “Vriksha” – “vriksh” – to wrap/enclose, and “a” = negation – the One Whom nothing and no one can wrap/enclose, the One Who has none greater than Him – the One Who is greater than all is called “vriksha.” It is That which is greater than these greats: earth, water, fire, air and space. All of these [elements] are also called “sarva” [all]. These are also “vriksha” [the greatest among phenomena]. That is because it is not easy to grasp them. But That which is attained by the great element mind – That is called Brahman. All phenomena are insignificant, impermanent and limited in relation to Brahman. That Brahman is none other than “I”. And no matter how great the beings [great ones] of Prakriti are, they cannot enwrap “I”. Thus, among all “vrikshas” [greats] “I” am “Ashvattha” [Ungraspable]. “Ashvattha” = the destroyer of moments – meaning: where even momentary time does not arise.
 
Devarshi [divine sage] – a special state of being. The state in which every aspect [of existence] is known along with its cause, form and meaning – that is the “rishi-state” [sage-state]. Those who are in this state of being and are gods at the same time – they are “devarshis” [divine sages]. Among them, I am “Narada.” The word “Nara” means “Vishnu”; the word “da” means “daan” [giving]. One who gives Vishnu to someone – that is the one who is “Narada.” “Vishnu” is the name for the Omnipresent Consciousness – the Self. The Omnipresent Consciousness is verily Brahman. The one who can initiate one into this Brahman – that one is “Brahman-vid” [the teacher who shows Brahman]. That “Brahman-vid” is “Narada.” “Brahmavid brahmaiva bhavati” [I am the teacher who shows Brahman, and I am Brahman Itself]. Therefore, “Narada” is also “I”.
 
GandharvANAṃ chitrarathah [among “gandharvas” [celestial beings] I am “Chitrarath”] – “gandharva” – “gandh” means aggression, and “arva” means “to go.” The ones go into war because of aggression – meaning: those who intensely do not want to remain in the Mayic worldly experiences after having taken Kriya. The “gandharvas” [celestial musicians] know both “marga” (meaning: from above) and “deshi” (meaning: secular) types of music, and they are adept at teaching these. But they are not at all connected to the usual musical art. Here [in the spiritual realm] too, the seven tones are rising up, making one intoxicated. Some are being understood by the practitioner, some are not. If someone wants to learn, then the knowledgeable sage is able to teach that person up to this point. The sadhaks who have this state of being are called “gandharvas” [celestial musicians]. Among them, [I am] “Chitrarath.” “Chitra” [picture] means “a colorful drawing/painting.” And “rath” [chariot] means a very high resting place (that which can be driven or stopped at will). Just by being a sadhak, one knows this place. If one goes up to that place and sits there, there is no enchantment of Maya. Where there is no enchantment of Maya – the One Who resides there – That is the One Who is called “Chitrarath.” Because “I” do not live in the enchantment of Maya, “I” am “Chitrarath.”
 
Siddha [perfected being] – those who have completed sadhana, for whom there is nothing left to be done, those who are only enjoying the fruits of sadhana – they are the ones who are “siddhas” [perfected ones]. In this state, no vritti [active tendency] of the antahakarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] remains. That is the one who is “muni” [sage with inner silence]. “Munih saṃleenamAnasah” [“muni” is one who has merged his/her mind [in the Self]] – the one for whom all of the happenings of mind have been completely merged [in the Self] – that is the one who is “muni.” When this state comes, the sadhak witnesses the form of “Kapil” in the Sphere by oneself. “Kapil Muni” [a mythological sage] in a previous life, left his body after having fulfilled all aspects of sadhana. Because of this, all that was left for him was to enjoy the fruits of sadhana. Immediately upon taking re-birth, all of the fruits of that sadhana became present in him. That is why he is called “janma-siddha” [perfected right from birth]. There is no birth in “I”. All aspects and attainments of sadhana have finished. There is nothing at all to be done or acted upon. That is why, among “siddhas” [perfected beings], “I” am “Kapil Muni.”
"
27,"Among “ashvas” [horses], know Me to be “Amritotbhav ucchaishravA.” Among “gajendras” [elephants], [I am] “Airavat,” and know Me to be “Nara” among “manushyas” [humans].","When the sadhak travels according to instructions within the brahmanadi in the sushumna (that brahmanadi is that which is called “ksheersamudra” [sea of sweet milk]) – this action is that which is called “traveling the sea.” As Kriya is practiced continuously, these seven primary “vayus” [vital-airs] arise: “pravaha,” “sangvaha,” “vivaha,” “udvaha,” “aavaha,” “parivaha” and “paraavaha.” Among these, “sangvaha” is related to “apana,” “vivaha” to “samana,” “udvaha” to “vyana,” “aavaha” to “udana,” and “parivaha” to “prana.” The work of “prana” is to preserve the body from within the body, and the work of “apana” is to expel “prana” from the body. At all times, there is this fight between the two vayus. The rubbing together [of prana and apana] that happens at the time of Kriya is of a special type. The seven [aforementioned] vayus are in the form of “shakti” [creative and active power] in each of the petals of each of the lotuses. There are seven [other] “matrika shaktis” from the Muladhar to the Sahasrar that keep those vayus integrated and in harmony, which, respectively, are: “Keerti,” “Shri,” “Vak,” “Smriti,” “Medha,” “Vriti” and “Kshama.” When, during the performance of Kriya, the vital-air from the space outside comes into the body – at that time, “Keerti” goes on rising from the Muladhar, and “Kshama” goes on descending from the Sahasrar. Due to the moving back and forth of these two shaktis – which are located at the two ends [of the aggregate of seven], the shaktis in the middle go through a transformation in their states. As soon as there is the rising up [of spiritual attention] to the place of “Kshama,” right then, the work of “Keerti” disappears. And as “Kshama” comes to the place of “Keerti,” it immediately spreads its “Kshama-ness” everywhere. The way that the shaktis in the middle were previously operating (all of their activities were directed towards creation) – all of the operations of all of those shaktis – as well – turn around – meaning: they become Brahman-facing. For this reason, each of the vayus in all of the petals of the six lotuses turn around, and go on directing each of their powers in the non-samsaric path. Within this aggregate of these shaktis, 14 types of sounds/tones come forth. All of these tones can be heard in the upper regions. And they are continuous, never-ending and unbroken. That is why the name is “ucchaivashravasam.” [heard together in the upper place]. And because this endless, unbroken-ness is established in “I”, “I” am “ucchashrava.” “Ucchaishrava” is the greatest of the “ashvas.” What is “ashva” [traditional meaning: horse]? “Ashva” is that which takes someone/something on its back and goes about – meaning: a weight-bearing animal. The vayus within the body that take the mind upon their backs and bring it outside through exhalation and make it gather up the experiences of sound-touch-sight-taste-smell, and again through inhalation carry those experiences into the body and make one experience them in the “manomaya kosha” [mental sheath] – those two vayus in the forms of exhalation and inhalation are called “ashva” [bearing mind on their backs]. Among them, the vayu that takes the mind through the “naad” [inner sound] and through the “jyoti” [inner light] and has one realize That Vishnu – that is the one that is “ucchashraivas,” which has been previously mentioned.
 
Separation/broken-ness is death; only the unbroken-ness bit is “amrita” [immortality; nectar of immortality]. Because this state is realized from the unbroken sound, “ucchashraivas” is said to come forth from “amrita” [nectar] (“amritodbhava” [coming forth from “amrita” [nectar]; see Bengali translation above for occurrence of the term in a slightly different form]. This is because during this state, the ambrosia dropping from the Sahasrar endlessly consecrates Kshama at the Muladhar. And because the direction of that “amrita” has turned back, it never ends. In this state that is devoid of the ending of the flow of nectar, that tone can be heard. This state is the operation of Shakti-Agni (there are no outward directed vrittis [functionalities]). That is why “Ucchashraiva” is said to be the Indra’s [the lord of fire’s] ride/mount.
 
airAvataṃ gajendraNAm [among “gajendras” [great elephants] I am “Airavat”] – “airavat” (ira = water; and “vat” = similar to) – it is like water, but not water – something that completely satisfies intense thirst. “Gaja” is the name of one who melts with the pleasure of touch, one who loses oneself in the pleasure of touch. And “indra” means the “highest” [of a particular group] – meaning: the one who loses oneself in the pleasure of pure touch and experiences the full satisfaction of the quenching of all of the worldly thirsts – that is the one who is “gajendra” [king of the “gajas”] (Airavat). Now, dear sadhak, check this against your own experience. When you go to pierce the Anahata (the place of attachment) after having pierced the eight-aspected place from the Manipur – at that time, you become so intoxicated, and you so lose yourself due to the pleasure of touch, that all the hairs on your body stand on end. A shivering comes to your body. It is not cold, yet there is shivering. Such is this kind of shivering that no matter what you try, you cannot stop/quench it. All of your external body, from the feet to the head, shake. At this time, in your heart and in your head, such a cooling touch is experienced that it gives you all satisfaction. There are no worldly experiences; there are no enjoyments left; there is nothing left to attain/have. Yet, as you continually keep on attaining all that is to be attained, you go above and merge. At that time, whether outside or within, there is no kind of sense of either’s existence [no sense of outer and inner]. During this state, there is the witnessing of a white elephant on the east side of Kutastha. That is “Airavat.” This state is not different from “I”. Therefore, “I” am “Airavat” among “gajendras.”
 
NarAnAṃcha narAdhipam – among the “naras,” I am “Naradhip” [king of the “naras”]; “nara” – “n” means taking and getting; “a” is a letter of negation – the state in which there is no taking and getting – that is the state of “nara.” Taking and getting are of the worldly experience. The worldly experience exists up to the Vishuddha-lotus. When one goes above the worldly experience (goes up to the Ajna-chakra), one is bestowed the right of self-improvement. The one for whom the right to improve oneself has come about – that one is called “nara.” As well, if one does not come back down after getting up to the Ajna-chakra, one can become “adhip” (king). This is because at this place, there can be both self-improvement and, at the same time, one can also rule over the worldly experience below as well. It is from abiding in this place that one witnesses the Supreme Person Vishnu and one attains His qualities. The one who rules – that one is called “king.” Lord Vishnu rules this creation (the place of experiencing the worldly matters). Yet, because He is not connected to them, He remains as the Lord of yoga/Lord of yogis. That is why I am saying that among “naras,” “I” am the highest of the “naras” – their King; and That Vishnu is “I”. "
28,"I am “vajra” [thunderbolt] among “aayudha[s]” [weapons]; among “dhenu[s]” [cows], I am “Kamadhenu” [wish-fulfilling cow]; I am “Kandarpa,” the cause of the emergence of the “prajana[s]” [begotten], and among “sarpa[s]” [serpents], I am “Vasuki.”","AyudhAnAṃ ahamvajram – Among “aayudha[s]” [weapons] I am “vajra” [thunderbolt]. “Aa” + “yudh” + “a” – that by which one does battle. Weapons and missiles and such things with which one strikes are called “aayudha[s]” or “praharan.” “Praharan” – “pra” – “prakrishta” [verity; true; actual]; “hṛ” = to do “haran” [take away] + “anat” [a suffix] – the One Who truly takes away. The thing upon which this [weapon] is applied [weapon is struck] – this weapon takes that thing’s existence away – that is why this is called “praharan.” In this body, it is only vayu [vital-air] is the “aayudha” [weapon] in the form of “praharan.” Vayu, as well, is residing in the body under many names. Among them is “vajra” [thunderbolt]. “Vaj” = going; “raṃ” = the fire-seed; fire is both self-illuminating and other-illuminating. It is luminescent, movement-endowed, and on whatever it falls, it has the power to take that away [consume that; destroy that]. The one who is like this is called “vajra.” The Great Vayu by whose operation there is the existence of the body – that supremely holy, supremely worship-worthy, lord of pranas is called “Vajra.” To whomever this great power is directed during the time of repose – that very person becomes victorious. (This is a known fact for the sadhak.) Victory is eternally established in “I”. Therefore, among “aayudhas,” “I” verily am the victory-endowed “Vajra.”
 
DhenunAmasmi kAmadhuk [among cows, I am the wish-fulfilling cow, “Kamadhuk”] – that from which a free-flowing, stomach-filling food-substance (drinkable liquid) can be had – that is called “dhenu.” The nectar that is dripping within this body – upon drinking that nectar, at the time of going to the State of Immortality, a certain state is reached where whatever is desired – that can be had. For this reason, that state is called “kamadhuk” [wish-fulfilling]. That state of Mine is very, very close to “I” and it is almost one with “I”. That is why, among “dhenus,” “I” am “Kamadhuk” (“Kamadhenu”). “Dhenu” – the sound “dhe” means “drinkable liquid” and “nu” means the “doer” – meaning: the One Who bestows the drinkable sustenance – that is the one called “dhenu” (the milk-giving cow). Among all of the kinds of digestibles, the drinkable thing is the one that is free-flowing and fills the stomach. This can be had from “dhenus” [cows]. “Kama” means “desire”; “dhu” means “stirring”; and “ka” means the “Self.” In order to understand the feeling of the word “kamadhuk,” one has to know the free-flowing stirring that happens when there is the desire to enjoy. This is the highest enjoyment and effort-free. Now dear sadhak, see. Just that much – after you have the knowledge of discerning between Prakriti and Purush – that bit that is the tone “nishad” [the equivalent of “ti” or “si” in western music’s solfeggio]  – “ni” [short form of “nishad”] is the final tone among the seven notes [of the octave]. The sustaining resonance [microtonal notes] even above that “ni,” all the way until just before reaching the octave – all of the microtones that are there just about to touch the octave but coming back down after not touching the octave, and then again making the effort to go back5 – this bit of intense coming and going without break is called the “kamadhuk” state. In this state, there is no aim but “I”. One almost reaches the “I” but is not able to do so. This oscillation that goes back and forth – even though it is a vibration/oscillation, because it is imbued with “I”, it is actually nothing else but “I” Itself. In this state, whatever a jiva [person] wants – he/she gets that very thing. That is why among “dhenus,” “I” am “Kamadhuk.” — Begin Translator’s Note — This simile refers to the technique of oscillating tones and microtones used in precise ways in Indian Classical Music, where there is no use of static chords other than a drone. The precise oscillation of one note not quite reaching the resolution note, coming back and trying to reach the resolution again and again, creates the feeling of “longing” or “wanting” –  or “kama.” — End Translator’s Note —

PrajanashchAsmi kandarpa [among “prajana[s]” [begotten], I am “Kandarpa”] – The sound “pra” means “fame” – meaning: the announcing of names; the sound “jan” means “taking birth”; and the sound “a” means “doer/lord.” The ones who are announced immediately after taking birth – meaning: the names that come about (meaning: whatever is seen in samsara) – that is “prajana.”
 
Kandarpa – “kaṃ” = Brahmaa, the creator. “Brahmaa” + “dṛp” = to do “sandipan” [captivate] + “a” (“an”) = sound related to “doing” – meaning: right upon taking birth, the one who does “sandipan” to the creator Brahmaa (entrances [the creator Brahmaa]) (the creator of a thing is “Brahmaa” to that being or thing) – that is the one who is “Kandarpa.” Now, dear sadhak! Just look at Me once. It is “I” Who am without name before birth. After birth, names are attached to “I” Itself. And the one to whom I am born, I keep that creator entranced in “I”. Therefore, “prajana” and “kandarpa” – the activation place of both of these words is “I”.
 
SarpANAsmi vAsuki [among serpents I am “Vasuki”] – serpent means hooded (venomous) snake. Among the venomous hooded snakes I am “Vasuki.” “Vasu” + “k”. “Vasu” means the “self-revealed jewel-gem,” like diamond, emerald, etc. And the sound “k” means “head.” One will be a hooded serpent (snakes are venomous), will keep the self-revealed jewel-gem in the head – the greatest among these serpents – that serpent is called “Vasuki.” The Self-revealed One is no one but “I”. Thus, whatever state of Maya that remains blended with “I” – that state is the greatest, or spoken of as “king.” Thus, among the bejeweled great serpents, “I” am “Vasuki.”
 
“I” have no state of My own. There has never been any such thing as Maya that has even existed. It is like this only to appease the dharma of the antahkarana [personal consciousness]; and the springing forth that comes forth from there – only that is the manifestation of Maya. When the game is being played with “I” in the dharma of the antahkarana, just that bit is called the highest state of Maya. Upon continuously doing guru-instructed Kriya, the hooded, luminescent, bejeweled-headed serpent that the sadhak sees in Kutastha – that serpent is verily the image of “Vasuki.” "
29,"Among the “nagas,” I am “Ananta,” and among the gods of the waters, I am “Varuna.” Among the ancestors I am “Aryama,” and among “samyama,” I am “Yama.”","“Ananta” is that which has no boundaries, no source. “Naga”[snake-like] = “n” + “aga”; “n” = not; “aga” = serpent – meaning: that which is not a serpent, but is like a snake. Snakes have venom. This entity does not have venom. A snake’s beginning and end can be seen with its narrowness or girth. This entity is only long (it can be seen in Kutastha). This kind of “naga” is called “Ananta.” It is he who is the bed of Vishnu on the Ocean of Sweet Milk. That “Vishnu” is “I”. “Ananta” is always absorbed in Me, and therefore existing as “I”. Thus, among “nagas,” “I” am “Ananta.”
 
VaruNoyAdasAmaham – “varuna” – “va” – means “encircling,” and the sound “unan” means to be connected to a thing – meaning: the one who is encircling. The Earth is encircled by seas, or the liquid-element. “YAdah” – meaning: the gods of the waters – like: wells, lakes, springs, rivers, tributaries, etc. All of these are life-powers in the world. Within all of them is the liquid-element – meaning: “I” am presiding within them as the Nourishing Power. The place of residence for all of these small powers is the “I”, the All-Powerful Infinite God “Varuna.”
 
PitṛNAmarmyamA chAsmi [among the ancestors, I am “Aryama”] – “AryamA” – “arya” (“ṛ” = going) + “mana” [mind] + “kanin.” “Kanin” means “receiving illumination.” Thus, the one who, after casting off the body [dying], goes to the plane of the ancestors and attains Supreme-ness and Illumination – that is the one who is “Aryama.”
 
Dear sadhak! Now look. When, through particular Kriya, you abide in subtle form in the brahmanadi within the “chitrani” – at that time, you are not in the physical body. What to say, whether there is a physical body or not – even that is not in your awareness [at this time]. In this state, the masculine form (the Form of the Self) that you see within the masses of energy at Kutastha – know that that is verily “Aryama,” the lord of the ancestors. This holy deity comes at the appropriate time to give encouragement to the sadhak and blesses him/her. A Luminescent Form of Oneself that is different from [or: other than] the physical body can be witnessed. Thus, “I” am “Aryama” as well.
 
Yamah saṃyamatAham – “Yama” is the name of the lord of the abode of halting. “Yam” = to do “nivritti” [spiritual withdrawal] + “an” = one who is connected to it – meaning: the one who causes “nivritti” to happen is “Yama.” “Nivritti” [non-wave] means the waveless state of the antahkarana [personal consciousness]. After pratyahar [spiritual in-turning], the state that comes from the aggregate of dharana [spiritual concentration], dhyan [meditation] and samadhi is called “samyama” [all-halting; all-absorbed]. The state in which there is no aggression, where truth [non-lying] (“satya parahitaṃ proktam” [truth-ness is that which benefits the well-being of others]), non-stealing, chastity, and non-grasping are established – that is the state called “yama.” The state in which I live as if I am dead, even though I am alive (not death, not sleep, not swoon – yet a certain kind of effort-free and suffering-free way of living) – when this becomes a state that lasts for very, very long periods (what to say, even the anxiety of the breaking of dharna-dhyan-samadhi is not there) – it is then that the state of “yama” comes about. “Samyama” is a small state of being, and “yama” is a great state of being. Both of these are My States. Thus, among “samyama” I am “Yama” [dead while alive]. This body is that which is called “Pretpur” [the abode of ghosts]. "
30,"Among the “daityas,” I am “Prahlad,” “Kaal” among “vasheekari[s],” “Mrigendra” among “mrigas” and “Garuda” among “pakshis.”","PrahlAdashchAsmi daityAnAm [among “daityas,” I am “Prahlad”] – “Prahlad” – “pra” = renown + “halad” = to become “ahladita” [delighted] + “an” [declension]. The one who is renowned for giving delight – that is the one who is “Prahlad.”
 
Daitya [traditional meaning: fallen but powerful souls] – The lineage that has emerged from “Diti” [a mythological woman]. Longing for a son, Diti used to go to make love to Kashyap [a mythological sage] at inauspicious times. Because of that [having sex at inauspicious times], an “asat” [non-good] lineage was born from them. Because “asat” does not actually exist [alternate translation: cannot last], this lineage’s dharma is that of death. At some point in time, some member of this lineage received grace from some saint (Narada), and the “a”  [“non”] was removed. Then only “sat” [good; truth] remained. There is no destruction of “sat.” Vishnu Himself is represented by the word “Sat.” “Hlad” [delight] exists in Vishnu Himself. The person from the lineage of Diti who was representing the delight of Vishnu and presided as such – that is the person who is called “Prahlad.” That Prahlad is – verily – “I”.
 
Kashyapa [see second sentence of above paragraph] – “kashya” means liquor – that which intoxicates. And “pa” means “to drink.” Enter yourself and see the truth of it. When the flow of nectar in the reverse direction intoxicates you – at that time, there is no operation occurring in your antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness]; yet, it is not inoperative either. This state is your state of “kashyap.” When, in this undisturbed state, there is the rising of previously created impressions for the enjoyment of worldly experiences, which sometimes create stirrings in your stillness – that is your state of “diti.” At this time, a little attention goes towards the outer world, and an incredibly beautiful, golden, massive light swallows you up and covers you. This is your state of being “Hiranya Kashyipu” [a mythological fallen yet powerful being who was the father of Prahlad]. The word “hiranya” means “golden,” and “kashyipu” means to be swallowed up. When even this mind-captivating effort by Prakriti to enslave you fails – the beautiful delight that arises in you due to this failure [by Prakriti] – that delight is “Prahlad.”
 
“KAlah KalayatAmaham” [among the spell-casters, I am “Kaal” [time; death]] – “kalyatAm” [means] “vasheekari[s]” [spell-workers]. “Vasheekaran” [spellbinding] can happen through gems, mantras, and elixirs [and such]. Whatever kinds of “vasheekari shaktis” [spellbinding powers] that there are – among them I am that which casts a spell over all - “kaal” [time; death].
 
“Kaal” – the sound “ka” means “Brahmaloka.” The sound “aa” means “atmosphere”; “la” means “Earth.” The universal/subtle sheath is formed by these three. Whatever there is in this universal sheath – all of them are under the power of this very sheath – meaning: creation, preservation and destruction are happening within this very sheath. Wherever anyone/anything may be, that person/thing is operating in that place only; no one has any power/right to move from the place where one is. And even this sheath is established in “I”. Thus, among the “vasheekaris” [spell-casters] “I” am there in the form of “Kaal.”
 
MṛgANAṃcha mṛgendro’ham [among the “mrigas,” I am “Mrigendra”] – “mriga” means “animal.” Among these animals, I am the “mrigaraj” [king of the animals] – the lion (which can be seen in Kutastha). In the inner direction, the word “mriga” means “yancha” [petitioning]. The greatest among “yanchas” is “mumukshuta” [intense longing for God].
 
“VainateyashchapakshiNAm” [among “pakshis” [ordinary meaning: bird; see spiritual definition and explanation below] I am “Garuda” [mythological bird]] – “Vainateya” [means] “Garuda,” who was born of the egg from “Vinata.” “Vinayataa” means one who is very humble. Dear sadhak! See. While doing Kriya, you have two states that come about. One is low; the other is high. When the mind takes the five organs of action, the five organs of perception and the five pranas, and thereby takes up its place in the physical body of five elements in order to enjoy the worldly experience – that is your dark direction – meaning “avinata” [egotistical] state. And when you gather up the externally directed activities and take the bright path in the upper direction – at that time, you take these five organs of perception, five organs of action and five pranas (when you leave behind the waking state of the physical body) and do Kriya in the subtle body – this is your state of “vinata” [humility]. At this time you fall into a kind of dream-like state, and you see a winged, golden-colored bird within the egg-shaped place in the Kutastha. He is “Garuda.” He destroys the “visha” [poison] that is “vishaya” [worldly experience]. That is why his name is “Garuda” (“gar” + “uda”). The word “gar” means “poison.” The word “uda” means casting it away. The one who casts away poison – he is “Garuda.” In this state, the mind is free of the worldly experience and abides in the Sky of Consciousness. “I” too have no “vishaya” [worldly experience; the holder of poison]. And these “bright” and “dark” aspects are also called “paksha[s]” [mystical wings] Those who have “pakshas,” those who travel about in the Void – are “pakshis” [celestial birds]. Among these “pakshis,” “I” am “Garuda” [the One Who casts away the poisonous worldly experience]."
31,"Among the things that purify, I am “Pavan” [wind]. Among the wielders of “shastra[s]” [weapons], I am “Rama.” Among the “matsya[s]” [fishes], I am “Makara.” And among the currents, I am “Jaahnavi” [Ganges].","Pavanah pavatAmasmi – whatever kinds of purifying things there are – among them, I am the all purifying “vayu” [vital-air] (pranayam with the aim of the sadhaks’ enlightenment). “Pavan” [wind; air] – the sound “pav” means “to purify + “an” – a sound expressing the active principle – meaning: the one who purifies. The false is that which is impure (mutations). As the mutations of Maya come into Me and become purified, “I” am the all-purifying “Pavan.”
 
RAmah shastrabhṛtAmaham – “Rama” – the One [Supreme Self] Who romances the Atma [Self]. He is “shastrabhrit” [weapon-wielder]. “Shas” – to kill or to discipline. It is vayu [vital-air] that is the disciplinarian of the body, or the commander; thus, it is “shastra” [tool of discipline]. Joining the arrow of vayu to the bow of the spinal column, the One Who commands this and becomes victorious over all – that “Atma-Rama” [Rama-Self] is “I”. In the chariot of this body, the ten sense-organs are going in ten directions. The one who is controlling their movements – that is the one called “Dasharath” [symbolic name of Rama’s father in the Ramayana [an epic]]. From the state of “Dasharath,” the Romance of the Self and the Supreme Self arises. That is why that State of Romance is called “Daasharathi Rama.” During this state when the ten sense-organs are silent, vayu moves in the path of sushumna in the spinal column and thus the Romance in the form of Union of the Self and the Supreme Self takes place, and because of this Rama is known as “shastrabhriti” [weapon-wielder] and “Daasharathi” [the charioteer of the “ten”].
 
RAma – “rA” = cosmos + “ma” – the One Who is the Lord of the cosmos – He is called “Rama.” “Shastra” [a kind of weapon] is some thing with which one strikes, such as scimitar, axe etc. And “astra” [a kind of weapon] is some thing with which the striking is done by throwing, such as arrow, round projectile, bullets etc.6 And the one who uses these things with which one strikes – that person is called “shastrabhrit” [weapon-wielder]. — Begin Translator’s Note — The meanings of “shastra” and “astra” are also spoken of in reverse. “Shastra” can mean “missile,” and “astra” can mean “a weapon with which one strikes.” — End Translator’s Note —

Three avatars [divine incarnations] of Vishnu: “Parashurama,” “Daasharathi Rama” [usually known as “Rama”] and “Balarama” – because Daasharathi Rama was victorious over Parashurama, Daasharathi Rama gained primacy. And the highest form of the Divine-Life-Force of Krishna blossomed in Krishna, and not in Balarama [a being who was Krishna’s Divine Extension]. Among the Divine Glories, the Primary Glory is the “Only-ness.” Because this “Only-ness” remained ever-present in Daasharathi Rama, it is Daasharathi Rama that is said to be the Perfected Shastrabhrit. Now the thing is, whether you say “astra” or “shastra,” both of these are Prakritic [material]. Those whose source is Prakriti – they are Prakritic. “MayAdhyaksheNa prakṛtih sooyate sacharAcharam” [under My direction, Prakriti operates the moving and the non-moving]. The One Who is holding this Prakriti-weapon in the form of the cosmos, yet Whose “Only-ness” is not corrupted – the Rama Who is like this – that is the one who is “Shastrabhrit Rama.” That “Rama” is none other than “I”. (Dear sadhak! Observe that bit that is your “I”-State. If that is done, you will understand the meaning, along with realizing the Taraka-Brahman Rama State.)
 
ṚShANAṃ makarashchAmi – among fishes, I am “Makara.” “Rish” – the sound “ri” means “perspective”; the sound “sh” means “most great.” Among all of the greatnesses that preside within (such as: “so’ham/sohang” – That I am; “matsa” [I am That]; “so’ham brahmAsmi” – I am that Brahman; “aham brahmAsmi” – I am Brahman and all such recited sadhana-related words that there are – meaning: the words which, when sounded, make one Brahman-filled) – all of those are dressed with the highest of Glories. Among these, there is “Makara.”

The One in Whom there exist: control, desire’s fire, the moon’s nourishment, Shiva’s settledness, Vishnu’s omnipresence, Brahmaa’s creativity, poison’s destructiveness, air’s life-force, bondage’s strictness, mantra’s fruit, time’s indivisibility, sun’s light and Daksha’s rulership [Daksha – a son of Brahmaa]; the One Who knows how to hold, and does not know how to let go – meaning: whoever or whatever it is that He holds, He does not let go of that (like the rays of the setting sun and the sun). He is the One called “Makara.” It is He who is the ride/vehicle of the purifying Ganges. The Great Shakti that delivers the fallen – She takes refuge in Me. That is why, among “rish” [fishes], “I” am “Makara.”
 
SrotasAmasmi jAhnavee – among the currents, or the “pravahinis” [flows], I am “Jaahnavi” (Ganges). If there is a beginning and an end [to a current], that is not “pravahini.” The current whose beginning and end cannot be found – that is “pravahini,” like the flow of Pure Awareness. There is no beginning or end to this current; thus, she is called “Ganga” [Ganges]. “Gacchateeiti ganga” [it goes; therefore it is called “ganga”]. The one whose unbroken motion is going on – she is the one who is called “Ganga” [Ganges]; she is “Jaahnavi.” Because [the sage] “Jahnu” drank up Ganga and ripped out the “jaanu” [knees] and threw them out, Ganga is called “Jaahnavi.” “Jaanu” means the junction point between the thigh and the leg, or knee – meaning: where motion begins. “Jahnu” – “jah” + “n” = in lordship; “haa” – means “to let go.” “Jahnu” is one who is a master renunciate. “Jahnu” is a “rajarshi” [royal sage]. The rishis [sages] that have rajoguna as the predominant guna – they are called “rajarshi[s].” This rajoguna is the playground of volition and non-volition. Therefore, in this field, the flow of pure knowledge is covered up. This is the “swallowing up of the Ganges” by Jahnu. Volition and non-volition are the play within, and of, the “manomaya kosha” [mental sheath]. Because speech and such do not come forth when one is in this state, people on the outside have called [a person in this state] “muni” [sage with a vow of silence]. And then again, when the state of “mauna” [not-speaking] comes to an end, and the sagacious words come forth (the current of teachings), that is when the cover of the covered-up current of knowledge comes apart and the current is seen. That is why there is the name “Jaahnavi” [of “Jahnu”]. That Immaculate Flow of Awareness is My Form. “Jnana pravAhA vimaleti ganga” [“ganga” is the pure flow of awareness]. That is why [“I” am] the Ganges – “Jaahnavi” – among the currents."
32,"O Arjuna! It is I Who am the beginning, end and middle of creation. Among “vidya[s]” [knowledge[s]], I am “adhyatmavidya” [spiritual knowledge], and among “vaadi[s]” [logics; argumentations] ([meaning:] among “vaad” [mutual discussion]; “jalpa” [adversarial argument], “vitanda” [wrangling for the sake of winning alone]), “I am “vaad.”","“Sarga” [creation; see first line of sloka above] means “levels” – meaning: that which has a beginning, middle and end. This cosmos is also endowed with a beginning, middle and end. O Arjuna! O sadhak! It is “I” Who have become the levels and am visible to you as this cosmos. When space is partitioned by a fence, it looks to the physical sight that space has been divided. Just as, in truth, space is not divided, and in that [apparent] partition’s beginning, middle and end there is no absence of the presence of space – in the same way, in Indivisible Brahman, even though the One “I” is divided into many via the imaginary powers of Maya’s partitions (even if, through Mayic eyes, the separation is visible), Brahman actually remains Undivided. That is why I am saying, “O sadhak! See it directly. All of the levels that exist (creation) within you from the earth-element to Maya – in their beginnings, middles and ends, “I” am there in Undivided Form. Your created levels, are like jewels strung on a thread, and even though you see it through your eyes as existing on Me – still, that is not true.”
 
AdhyAtmavidyA vidyAnAm [among knowledges, I am spiritual knowledge] – “vidya” (“vid” = knowing; and “y” + “a”) – that by which the knowledge of things can be known. Everything that there is in this creation – that is the “false.” And that which makes one think that that falseness is true – that is “Avidya” [non-knowledge; ignorance]. “Adhyatma vidya” [spiritual knowledge] is that which takes the intelligence and merges it into the Self. (See definition of “adhyatma” in Chapter 8, sloka 3 [of the Pranab Gita].)That is why I am saying that whatever types of knowledges there are – among them the Knowledge of the Self is “I”. Dear sadhak! See. When, after leaving everything and everyone from Earth, you fall into “I” and become “I”, everything else disappears, but that “I” does not go away. That which cannot be divided up by the three phases of time – that is that which is “nitya” [eternal]. That spiritual knowledge is also Eternal; thus, it is “I”.
 
VAdah pravadAmaham [among argumentations/logics, I am “vaad”] – “Pravadan” [argumentation[s]] means the blah blah blah between him, her, them. And the enquiry that happens after becoming devoid of questions, the enquiry to find Truth – that is that which is called “vaad” [proper enquiry; inner resonance]. Truth is nothing/no one but “I”. Thus, among “pravadan,” “I” am “vaada.”"
33,"Among “varnas,” I am the form of “a”. Among “samaas,” I am “dvandva.” I, indeed, am the unending time, and all fruits of actions are presided over by Me.","All of the symbols of vowels and consonants are individual letters. The letters that can be completely pronounced without the help of other letters are called “vowels” – such as: “a”, “i”, “u” etc. And the letters that cannot be fully pronounced without the help of vowels – those are consonants – such as “k[a],” “kh[a],” “g[a]” etc. Among all of these letters “I” am the letter “a.” This is because within the beginning, middle and end of every letter, “a” is present. But “a” is itself by itself. That which is Itself by Itself – that is “I”.
 
Dvadvah sAmAsikasya [among “samaas,” I am “dvandva”] – whatever you see in this creation – none of them are great. That is why one keeps another down and becomes adversely determined to show oneself as greater than another. But the One Who is actually Great – because His Greatness is complete and perfect, there is no need to show it. As well, whoever mingles with a great, becomes great. Dear sadhak! When you were in the intoxication of Maya, compare that state to this State of Settledness in Brahman. In that state of being intoxicated by Maya, you did not have any awareness of this State [of Settledness in Brahman]. Only the primacy of Maya was evident. Such as this Brahman-ness is, It was dormant at that time. That is why It was not [at that time] dressed up as “dvandva” [dual; with awareness of Divinity in the midst of illusion]. Even at that time, Maya was not without Brahman. But she kept herself as primary, and suppressed Brahman. And now? Now you are equally aware of both Brahman and Maya. This “becoming one” of these two, where one is not predominant, where neither is greater or smaller – becoming one in this way is called “samaas.” And keeping the primacy of all intact, and experiencing the oneness of all – that is called “dvandva samas” [experiencing Divinity in all]. Even though “I” am without activity, the active ones of Maya (those endowed with Maya), while remaining in Me, are showing each’s primacy; yet, they are not being separated from Me. Even though “I” am the Great, I am not causing any obstacles to their predominance. I am abiding as blended in with everyone. It looks as if “I” am coming about because of their being. This is “dvandva” [individual worshipping the Divine as dual]. It is in this state that knowledge is fully revealed. That is why among “samaas,” “I” am “dvandva.”
 
Ahamevakshayah kAlah [I am the unending time] – This time that is in existence in an unbroken way – when analysts cut it up into separate numbers of types – such as “kalaa,” “kaashtha,” “kshana,” “lava” [these are names for different and specific durations of time] – just as this does not corrupt the endlessness of time – similarly, when “I” is mentioned in relation to past and future, it does create any lack in the present-ness of “I”. Thus, “I” am both free of time and at the same time “I” am also the resting place for the arising of time. (Dear sadhak! You and your State of Settledness in Brahman. Examine this and see.)
 
DhAtA’haṃ vishvatomukhah [I am the Holder/Bearer of the mouth of the cosmos] – “dhata” means “one who holds/bears.” And the word “aham” means “I”. It is “I” Who am holding this creation – therefore, “I” am “dhata.” When the ego “I” is gone – it is then that this creation disappears. Thus, “I” am the director, ruler or the operator of this creation. That which is bound by limitation, which deteriorates – that is that which is called “body.” When the identification/vanity of “I” is put upon this body, the creation appears. “Vishva” [cosmos; universe] – “vi” = “vishesh” [something special; something particular]; “shva” = the dawn-time of the next day. Before this dawn-time of the next day, in-between, in the form of night, there is an “avyakta” [unexpressed] or “mrityu” [death] state. Just as there is ignorance in the form of sleep that takes place after the day is over, in the same way, there is the state  of “avyakta” [unexpressed; unaware] after the end of life. Just as at the end of the night there is re-emergence at dawn, similarly, after death, there is the taking up of rebirth. Both of these are called “the dawn-time of the next day.” This continuous movement of the expressed/manifested [life-state] and the unexpressed [death-state] that goes on happening again and again – this is that which is called “vishva” [cosmos; universe]. “Mukh” [mouth; face] means a door for entering and leaving. Because at the time of dissolution, this cosmos enters “I” and at the beginning of an epoch, goes back out from “I”, “I” am the “mukh” [mouth; entrance and exit] of “vishvato” [everything in the cosmos] (“sarvato” [all that there is in creation]), like the flower and fruit in a tree. Dear sadhak! There is no more effort needed to make you know/understand. If you look at creation when seated in the “True ‘I’,” everything will be directly visible to you. Look!"
34,"I am the all-destroying death as well. I am also the cause of the emergence of the living beings yet to come. Among women, I am renown, beauty/gloriousness, speech, memory, intelligence, steadfastness and patience/tolerance as well.","Mṛtyuh sarvarashchAham [I am the all-destroying death] – from the creator Brahmaa to inert matter and everything in creation – the aggregate of all of that is that which is called “sarva” [all]. The power through which this “all” is destroyed – meaning: when the transmutation of visage, state and place take place – that is that which is called “mrityu” [death]. Nothing escapes the hand of this death. Everything in this cosmic shell is under its power. It is due to its power that the Para and Apara Prakriti’s union is endlessly being destroyed (broken up). At the time of dissolution, this destruction-activity becomes intensely strong and destroys everything at once. This is why it is said that death is “the total destruction” or “the all-destroying.” This is that which is God’s Power of annihilation – the operation of tamoguna. Thus, it is a Divine Glory. That is why it has been said that “I” am the total-destruction-death. Udbhavashcha bhaviShyatAm [and those that emerge in the future] – after everything is destroyed at dissolution via that annihilating power in the form of total-destruction-death, the power by which the operations of creation begin again – that power is called “the power that is the cause of creation,” [or] “the power that is the cause of emergence.” Thus, it is also a Divine Glory. And for this reason, “I” am the emergence of the living beings who are to come in the future, after dissolution. Keertih shreervAk cheti [renown, prosperity, speech and such] – in these operations of creation and destruction by God – in this activity there is present a Shakti [Intelligent Power] that is responsible for settled existence. This [Power] is His power of maintaining – the operation of sattva guna. This Maintaining Shakti of His has seven powers, and She, the Mahashakti Goddess of sattva guna, is maintaining the order of the entire cosmos. Those seven powers are – “keerti” [renown], “shree,” [beauty/gloriousness], “vak” [speech], “smriti” [memory], “medha” [intelligence] and “kshama” [patience/tolerance].
Keerti [renown] – refers to the fame of dead people. This Mahashakti [great power] rules from the abode of desire below the Svadhisthan to the Muladhar. All of the desires that there are in samsara – she is the maintainer of all of those. Whatever it is that a human being does that is under the power of desire, whether good or bad – that remains after the end of the body (like lineage continuation being preserved). That is that which is called “keerti.” Shree [beauty/gloriousness] – refers to the one whom everyone serves. The one who is prior to deities, guru, gurus’ residence, certain places, the lords of those places, perfections, the right to perfection [and such] – this Holy Goddess is called “Shree.” She is the greatest Goddess ruling over sattva guna. Her playground is in the sushumna at the Svadhisthan. Wherever Her activities are – She makes them flourish. VAk [speech] – refers to the sounds produced by thought. The expression of [vocal] sound is produced due to fire-energy. Thus, this ruler of sound, the goddess of speech, presides in the Manipur-chakra, the abode of fire-energy. Smriti [memory] – refers to the remembrance of previously done things. This Mahashakti sports in all four parts of the antahkarana (mind, intellect, ego and chitta [personal consciousness]). Her playground is the “manomaya kosha” [mental sheath] at the Anahata-chakra. Medha [intelligence] – that in which all of the perspectives of the worldly experience (the perspectives of sound, touch, sight, taste and smell), through having experienced them many times, remain imprinted – that is called “medha” [learned intelligence] or “smaran-shakti” [active power from memory]. Her operations need to take place in a purified place, and therefore, her place of residence is in the Vishuddha-chakra (in the abode of space). Dhṛti [forbearance] – the power of holding fast. Her abode is the Ajnachakra. KshamA [patience; tolerance] – the power of patience. “BAhye vAdhyAtmake chaiva duhkhe chodpAdite kvachit; na kupyati na vA hanti sA kshamA parikeertitA” [displaying no anger, abuse or infliction towards the one who causes physical or mental grief – that is called “kShamA”]. She resides at the Sahasrar. Because these seven Mahashaktis are preserving the body of the jiva [individual person] as a mother would, they are the glorious ones among all “stree[s]” [female[s]] (women). Glories are actually established in “I”. Thus, because they [the Mahashaktis] are actually My Glories, they are “I”."
35,"Among the “sama[s],” I am “Vrihat Sama.” Among “chhanda[s]” [rhythmic poetry] I am “Gayatri [mantra],” Among months, I am “Margasheersha,” and among seasons, I am “Vasanta” [spring]. ","“Sama” refers to one particular Veda among the four Vedas. — Begin Footnote. — The music that is within the Vedas is called “sam[a].” The blessed Vyasadeva [the compiler of the Vedas], at the time of dividing the Vedas into parts, gathered together all of those musical pieces, set them in sequence and created one particular part [of the four parts of the Vedas]. That part is called “Sama Veda.” This is why the musical aspect is predominant in the recitation of the Sama Veda. Listening to the Sama-music, the mind gradually merges and goes into Infinity, and afterwards, crosses past “Shabda-Brahman” [Brahman-Sound/Word]. That is why there is the proverb: “gaanat paratara na hi” [there is nothing beyond Music; or: there is nothing greater than Music]. Following the Vedic example, the word “sam[a]” is also used in Greek and Latin in reference to sacred music. — End Footnote. — In each Veda, there are actually three parts – karma [acts], bhakti [worshipful observance] and jnana [knowledge; realization]. The part in the Sama Veda that is about attaining Liberation – that part’s name is “Vrihat Sama” [the big Sama]. “I” Myself Am Liberation Itself. The attainment is of “I” alone. Thus, “I” am “Vrihat Sama.”
GAyatree [a sacred mantra] – “gAyantaṃ trAyate iti gAyatree” [that, by singing which, one is delivered] – by singing which, one’s coming and going from this world ends. This [Gayatri mantra] is set up with twentyfour syllables using specific light and heavy emphases on the sounds of the letters. That is why it is called “chhanda” [rhythmic poetry]. Among all of the “chhandas,” Gayatri is the greatest. This is because this “chhanda” has such an effect that the singing of the Gayatri mantra makes one attain all knowledge, and one attains Brahman Itself. This does not happen with any other “chhandas.” Thus, “I” am “Gayatri.” Among the months I am “Margasheersha.” The time that the sun is in the “Mrigasheersha” [a star] zone is called the “Margasheersha” month. In the world of people, when the astrological aspects of time were first revealed – meaning: when human beings became aware of “future” and “that which has not yet come” in the movement of time – that is when the divisions of day, week, fortnight, month, year etc. were made. At that time, the first month from which the calculations began – that month is called “Agrahayan” [approximately from mid-November to mid-December in the western solar calendar]. The word “agra” means “first,” and the word “ayan” means “year.” “I” am Knowledge Itself. Because that Knowledge was first revealed in this month of “Agrahayan” or “Margasheersha,” “I” am “Margasheersha” among all of the months that there are. ṚtunAṃ kusumAkarah [among seasons, I am spring] – “kusum” [blossom; flower] is the finest part of a tree. As a simile to the tree, the blossom in the human being is knowledge. Because of the spring season being neither cold nor hot, the trees are full of vital-energy and this fine aspect [blossom; flower] manifests. With this, the trees are further beautified, and the splendrous part of Nature flourishes. And it is also true for human beings. When the body’s energy flourishes, the blossom of knowledge manifests – meaning: because the brain, at this time [spring], is nourished and healthy and facile, the inner journey of sadhana is traversed more easily than in other seasons. For this reason, the spring season is named “kusumakar” [blossoming], and it is for this reason that [spring] is the king of seasons. The subtlest part of substances is the part that is the manifestation of the Consciousness-Self, or the Divine aspect. That manifestation comes forth in this spring season, and thus, the spring season is the Lord’s Divine Manifestation. This is the outer side. Now, for the inner side, when the sadhak, due to the results of pranayam during sadhana, attains settledness in Kutastha, and the inner world becomes beautiful, when mind, in ecstasy, becomes intoxicated in the Inexpressible Bliss – that is the sadhak’s spring season of sadhana. At that time, the sadhak’s Knowledge of the Self flowers. And from that flower, the fruit of SelfRealization comes forth. — Begin Footnote. — This is actually the meaning of the “the coming to being of the six children of Vasudev.” [In this case, “Vasudev” is the name of Sri Krishna’s birth father, not Sri Krishna’s name; the “a” is short in this name, whereas it is long when a similar looking [in the Roman alphabet] name is used for Sri Krishna; furthermore, these six children are from Devaki [Sri Krishna’s birth mother], and not the offspring of Vasudev’s other wives.] For as long as Knowledge/Awareness does not fully manifest, for that long is SelfRealization impermanent – meaning: due to the attraction-power of Maya, the attainment ends after just a short time of having it. This is the meaning of the six sons of Vasudev [Sri Krishna’s father] being destroyed. All of this is part of the progress of elevation in the six chakras – the events of broken samadhi. Later, after crossing the six chakras and rising up to the seventh abode at the Sahasrar, Knowledge/Awareness fully manifests. And then Maya can no longer break the sadhak’s absorption. Therefore, SelfRealization becomes permanent and stays forever. This is the meaning of Vasudev’s seventh and eighth sons [Balarama and Sri Krishna] not being destroyed. — End Footnote. — For all of these reasons, both in the inner and the outer, the spring season is supreme. That is why it has been said, “Among seasons, ‘I’ am the blossoming spring.” "
36,"Among the cunning I am the game of “dyuta”; among the “tejasvi[s],” I am “teja”; I am “jaya” [victory] itself; I am “vyavasAya” [enterprise/endeavor] itself; and among the “sattvavAn[s]” [good beings], I am “sattva” [good] itself.","Among cunning acts I am “dyuta.” The activity that is done by betting against an opponent – that is called “dyuta.” This game of “dyuta” is a game of Kshatriya — Begin Footnote. — “KshatAt trAyate iti kshatriya” [one who delivers those who are wounded is called “kshatriya”]. “Kshata” [wound] is “incompleteness” [or: “non-wholeness”]. One who delivers beings from non-wholeness – he is “kshatriya.” — End Footnote. — kings, gambling in which, one loses everything and another becomes victorious. Among all the acts of cunning that are there, because “dyuta” makes one lose everything – this game of “dyuta” is “I”. Dear sadhak! See. The game played by the non-living is called “dyuta.” For as long as there is the restlessness of prana/life – meaning: there is moving about – for that long is there “sarva” [everything]. As soon as your prana became still, you “lost everything.” As soon as you lost everything (that is actually what is known as “being freed from everything”), you immediately became “I”. TejastejasvinAmaham – I am the “teja” of the “tejasvi[s]” [the phrase means: the energy of the powerful; the splendor of the splendid; the Light of the luminous]. Dear sadhak! Rise once again to “Vivasvan” [see commentary to Chapter 4:1-2 of the Pranab Gita]. Now look. All of the fire/light of the moon and the sun, the stars and the constellations, and even Maya’s light [that shows the world] are coming from “I”. Thus, “I” am the “Teja” of “teja” [Light of light].
Jayo’smi [I am victory] – “jaya” [victory] means “where everyone is defeated” [or: “where everyone loses”]. Whatever kinds of operations/activities there are – “I” am the resting place for all of them. Because I am Non-doing, no activity can defeat me. Thus, “I” am “jaya” [victory]. VyavasAyo’smi [I am enterprise/endeavor] – “vyavasa” [enterprise; endeavor] refers to getting and giving [exchange]. Maya, dressed up as Prakriti, takes something from “I” (this taking is actually that which is “samsara”), and then again it gives something to “I” (this is that which is called “pralaya” [dissolution]). This creation and dissolution of Maya – this is happening actually with “I”. Thus “vyavasaya” [the taking and giving] is also “I”. Sattvaṃ sattvatAmaham [I am the goodness of the good] – Those who sport (do sadhana) with sattva guna – they have eight types of states that happen to them. They are: sweating, stupefying, thrill, breaking of breath-flow, vibrating, radiance in the body, tears and dissolution. Dear sadhak! That day when you first went and sat in your meditation posture – go on and remember the sequence of the states of your sadhana from that day onward. Look: at the very beginning, sweat came out [of your body]; because of that, the body became calm, and as the usual tension went away, your body became as if it is stupefied, or unmoving. You were able to sit still. After that you experienced thrills – meaning: your body experienced goosebumps. After that there was a breaking of the breath-flow – meaning: the flow to which the movement of the exhalation and inhalation was bound before doing sadhana – that flow broke and another type of flow of exhaling and inhaling happened in you – meaning: both were actually balanced. With the exhalation becoming the same in proportion as the inhalation, the irregularity/dissimilarity of the flow came to an end. After that, “vepathu” (vibrating/quaking) came about – meaning: through pranayam, the flow of prana became extremely subtle and entered the sushumna, and being hindered by the crude phlegm [in the nadis] – for as long as that phlegm did not become dry through the upward push of prana, for that long did the colliding of the vayu’s [vital-air’s] movement [with the impurities in the subtle passages] shake the nervous system of the body. Right after that ends, the radiance of the body comes about – meaning: because the crude phlegm is dried-up and the path of sushumna is now clear, prana moves unhindered in its subtle and easy flow and awakens the steady and subtle power. Because of this, the radiance and beauty of the body shines forth and a comeliness/softness comes into being. The eyes become dreamy in their gaze. And at that, such a pure, radiant light comes forth – that everyone wants to love [that light]. The look of the body that used to be – that becomes transformed. After this state of sadhana, there are tears. It is as if everything that is of this creation – good, bad, everything there is – it is as if everything is dearest to my heart. Experiencing this, such a wonderful thrill is experienced in the heart that the life-force, filled with joy, intoxicates the heart and tears flow from the eyes (but this is not crying [not sorrowful]). After that, there is dissolution – meaning: the establishment in samadhi. One in whom these [states] have taken their place – that is the one who is called “sattvavan” [the good being]. In “sattvavans,” that “goodness” part is “I”, because it is through the manifestation of this goodness that delusion is destroyed, and one merges into “I”, and becomes “I”."
37,"In the lineage of “Vrishnee,” I am “Vasudeva”; among the “Pandava[s],” I am “Dhananjaya”; among the “muni[s],” I am “Vyasa”; and among “kavi[s],” I am “Ushana” [also called “Ushanas”] (“Shukracharya”).","“VṛShNee” – “vrish” = to rain + “ni” = sound denoting doership – meaning: those who make rain, such as clouds. Among them, I am “Vasudeva” [the first “a” is long; the all-pervading One; another name for Sri Krishna]. One in Whom everything resides, and One Who rains on everything – that High Being is “Vasudeva.” Because [Vasudeva/Sri Krishna in physical life] was born in the lineage of “Vrishnee,” it is being said: “in the lineage of Vrishnee.” And the residence-abode of the power that [expands,] sustains and contracts all that is rained upon (all that is creation-preservation-destruction oriented) is “I”. Thus, “I” AM “Vasudeva.” PANDvAnAṃ dhananjayah [“Dhananjaya” among “Pandava[s]”] – among the Earth children of King Pandu, [I am] “Dhananjaya.” The one who was victorious over the Kubera, the lord of “dhana” [wealth], and who had Kunti do worship of Lord Shiva with a “champa” flower made of gold – Lord Shiva bestowed upon him the name of “Dhananjaya” [one who is victorious over wealth/materialism/possessions]. (“Pandava” – see Chapter 1, sloka 1 [of the Pranab Gita][one of the names of Arjuna is “Dhananjaya,” who is a “Pandava”].) The word “Paandaa” means “highly intelligent scholar.” Even among these scholars, “I” am “Dhananjaya” [one who is victorious over wealth/possessions]. The jiva [person] has six types of possessions: birth, death, pleasure, pain, hunger and thirst. One who conquers these six – that one is “Dhananjaya” [ruler of the possessions]. Through doing tapasya [austerities] of Nara Rishi, Arjuna conquered these. Whoever is victorious – that one is also the ruler of the conquered. Thus, Arjuna is the ruler of these. Then again, there is no ruler/governor other than “I”. Thus, “Dhananjaya” is “I” as well. MuneenAmapyahaṃ vyasah – among “muni[s]” [see definition later in this paragraph], I am “Vyasa.” “Vyasa” – the one who creates sections. In the lower part of chitta [personal consciousness] is ahamkar [ego; personal “I”]. It is from this ego that divisions begin – meaning: the “Iness” begins to spread. Thus, “I” am “Vyasa.” (See commentary to sloka 13 in Chapter 10 [of the Pranab Gita].) The word “aham” [“I”] does not signify anyone at all other than “I”. Thus, “Vyasa” is also “I”. “Munih saṃleenamAnasah” [one whose mind is merged [in the Self] is “muni”]. When the mental functionality becomes completely merged [in the Self] (like sugar mixed in with sugar-cane juice) – that is when the meaning of the word “muni” is known. This is a state of Totality. When vrittis [functionalities] begin to operate in this state, there is a perturbation in the totality of the state – meaning: divisions/distinctions of many-ness come into being. Just this knowledge of this sectionalization – this bit of knowledge is called “vyasa.” And the State of Totality that is prior to the arising of this knowledge – that is the State of “I”. And it is in that “I” that the bit of knowledge of separateness exists. It cannot exist without “I”, and because of this, that bit is also “I”. Thus, in the state of “muni,” “I” am the state of “Vyasa.” KaveenAmushanah kavih [among poets, I am the poet “Ushana”; also called “Ushanas”] – one who speaks newly every time – that one is “kavi” [poet]. “Ushanas” – “ush” = to desire + “anas” = doership (along with the first part of the word) – meaning: “one who desires.” Poetness/poetry begins from desire itself. (“Kaviṃ purANam” – see commentary to sloka 9 in Chapter 8 [of the Pranab Gita].) I am the abode where desire resides. “Ushana” [in mythology] is the lord of desires. Thus, among “kavi[s]” [poets; those who create from desire], “I” am “Ushana” [the Lord of desires]. Creation and dissolution – both of these are under the power of desire. Dissolution coming from creation – this – which is happening spontaneously – one cannot experience poetry in this. But the creation that comes out from dissolution – that is where the poetry is. Because this poetry remained as the death-back-to-life power within “Ushana/Ushanas” [mythological poet] (within “Shukracharya” [another name for “Ushana”]) – he was able to even bring the dead back to life. This power too is established in “I”. It is from My death-back-to-life Power that “newness” happens. Now dear sadhak, take a look. The word “shukra” [referring to the other name of “Ushana/Ushanas”; see above paragraph] means: white, potency, purity. And again this Shukra is one-eyed. When the sadhak attains the state of purity, and, rising through a mass of light/power, conquers death – after that, all of the games, from their beginnings to ends, of this world of death, as well as any of the knowledge that there is about immortality – he/she knows all of this, and within him/herself experiences newness at every moment. In this state, the sadhak does not see through the physical eyes. Only the Eye of Knowledge remains open. This state happens when one does not remain under the power of Prakriti but has Prakriti under one’s power. “I” have Prakriti under My Power. Ushana had Prakriti under his power. That is why Ushana is greatest among poets. That which is greatest – That is “I”. Thus, “I” am “Ushana” as well."
38,"I am the “danda” [lit: stick/staff] of the rulers, [and] the adeptness of those who desire victory. I am the one who is the knowledge in the caves/secret places of the silent knowledgeable ones. ","“DaNDo damayatAmasmi” [I am the stick/staff of the rulers] – among the kinds of tools to use for commanding, “I” am the “staff.” Dear sadhak, take a look. In your body – the sense-organs, the matters grasped by the sense-organs, lust, anger and such – whatever functionalities of the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] that there are – all of these are wild and unruly. The only way of bringing them under one’s command is pranayam. Thus, whatever kinds of tools to command that there are – among them, “I” am that “staff” in the form of pranayam, in Whom all becomes still, where Establishment in Only-ness is attained. Neetirasmi jigeeShatAm – I am the adeptness of those who desire victory. That by which “the other” is conquered – that is called “niti” [adeptness]. The technique of a particular action is also called “niti” [skill; method]. This action is the directing of prana (taught by guru) in the path of the chitta [personal consciousness]. “I-ness” is established in this very thing. The one who wants to conquer Maya – that is the one who is called “jigeeshu” [desirous of victory]. Maunaṃ chaivAsmi guhyAnAm [I am the unspoken-ness/innate silence of the secrets as well] –all of the kinds of secret things that there are in the world – among them, the Satisfaction that comes from Ecstasy in Brahman – that is what is called “mauna” [unspoken-ness/innate silence]. Thus, that “mauna” is “I”. JnAnaṃ jnAnavatAmaham – “I” AM the Knowledge of the Self in the wise. "
39,"O Arjuna! The seed (cause of emergence) in all phenomena/living beings – I am that, as there is no phenomena – whether moving or unmoving – that can exist without Me.",O sadhak! Whatever you see in this static and dynamic universe – all of that is happening from “I”. All is “I”. You will not be able to see anything at all called “you” without “I”. There is no separate existence of anything apart from “I”.
40,"O Parantapa [Arjuna]! There is no end to My Glorious Manifestations. Nevertheless, I have now spoken to you in brief about these extensive Glories. ","Parantapa means: one who has the power to defeat the strength or power of another. All of these Maya-filled Manifestations cannot come to an end unless Maya is subdued and “I” predominates. (See “mAmeva ye prapadyante” [those who surrender to Me; Bhagavad Gita Chapter 7:14].) There is no beginning or end to these Manifestations. Nevertheless, I just told you about a few of them. Uddeshatah [with the intention of] – with the intention to include – meaning: by speaking about the primary [Manifestations], it is intended to include all [Manifestations]. "
41,"Whatever things you see that are glorious, prosperous and powerful, know that they are just parts of My own Power.","Qualities, power, influence, splendor, opulence – whatever there is that dresses up this world-sheath – know that each of those are manifesting from My Energy – verily."
{42}{stop},"But, O Arjuna! What need do you have in knowing this type of knowledge of the many, as I am holding this entire creation by a fraction [of My Power]?","O sadhak! There is no use in trying to understand that which is beginning-less and endless through the perception of beginnings and ends. Firmly accept that this universe-sheath emerges from Mahattattva. The Infinite Brahman on the Mahat-tattva is just like the reflection of the sky on the water of a pond. In the same way, you, me etc. – the innumerable beings are floating in the Great Brahman. Like the divisions in the ocean on the Earth which is suspended in the womb of space, even though they are called this land-mass, that land-mass, the other land-mass [etc.], within that water everything is united from water to water. But (because of ignorance) there is no understanding of that [water] being one, and an illusion of “many” is there, making everyone look foolish. In reality, just as One is [always] One – it is just like that, my friend! In the Infinite Brahman, in one (Undivided/Unseparated) Part [of the Infinity], the brokenup creation is being perceived through the partitions created by Maya. For as long as the Perception of Knowledge does not come about, for that long does one have to understand the Truth of Divinity through/in separate forms. It is for that long that the “perception of the many” remains. Once the Perception of Knowledge comes forth, then no perception of separation remains. The “perception of the many” also does not remain. The Perception of One, or the Perception of Unity comes about. At that time, this entire creation is directly seen as just a fragment of the Divine. Just as on one part of a human there are different parts and subparts, and hundreds of thousands of hair follicles – in the same way, in one fragment of the Divine, there are millions and millions of universes. He is the Cosmos. There is nothing besides That. That is why it is said in the scriptures: “pAdo’sya vishvA bhootani” [one fraction of Him is the universe and its beings]. Arjuna (the sadhak) has now progressed in the phase of “upasana” [spiritual and devotional awareness], and has become fit to have the Divine Eye opened. That is why the Blessed One (Gurudev) is advising that the sadhak leave behind the knowledge of the many and take up the Knowledge of the One. It is actually from here that “Vishvarupadarshana” [the revelation of the Universal Form] begins."
