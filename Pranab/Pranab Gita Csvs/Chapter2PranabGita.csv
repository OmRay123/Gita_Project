1,"Sanjaya said: “Madhusudan [Sri Krishna], seeing the despondent Arjuna overcome with compassion and tear-filled eyes, spoke these words to him.”","It is by rising above the visible and limited five elements that one gains complete victory. The inner vision that is revealed after achieving that complete victory is that which is called “Sanjaya” (“saṃ” [“san”] = total + “jay[a]” [victory]). And the direct knowledge that is born from observing with that inner vision, the knowledge against which there cannot even be a cause for doubt – the understanding that is possible through that knowledge – that is what is called the “statements by Sanjaya.”
 
“Vish” means that which has the power of permeation; “a” = addiction; “d” = giving; “giving” addiction to permeations is called “vishad.” Just as there is the permeation of names and forms given by the jiva to the [things of the] Maya-filled universe – in that same way, the meanings of the words relating to Brahman also have a certain kind of permeation. If one “gives” addiction to the permeation of Brahman, one has to end. And if one gives addiction to the permeation of Maya (the universe), one has to fall into suffering. The sadhak, while going forward to merge with the permeation of Brahman, ends up giving addiction to the permeation of Maya because of the errors of habit. And from that, those [vrittis] that come forth from the [permeations of the] meaning of the word “mine” - [the sadhak] takes them up because of [his/her] union with Maya [at that time], and becomes filled with pity. This is what is known as “Vishad Yoga.” Thus, being under the intensity of Maya, the tears come and cover up the power of external vision. As soon as the external vision is covered, immediately does the veil of the inner vision get lifted, and thrilling experiences come forth. Those experiences, verily, are the statements of Madhusudan [Sri Krishna] – meaning: the spontaneous deliberation and resolution of one's own questions by one's own understanding/knowing in one's own self-awareness. “Madhu” [honey] refers to something very sweet. The jiva's desires for enjoyments in samsara are the “sweet things.” The One Who is the “sudan” (eliminator) of that “honey” appearing as desires – meaning: the One Who Liberates the jiva from the samsara-calamity – it is He Who is “Madhusudan” (Kutastha “Tarak Brahman”). Because the treasures of knowledge, detachment and such are always present in Him, He is called “Bhagavan” [the Divine One; the Lord; God]."
2,"The Lord said: “Arjuna! How did this “kashmal” [ordinary meaning: confusion, timidity; see commentary below for spiritual definitions] – which is “anAryasevita” [not of service to sages], “asvargya” [does not lead to heaven] and is “akeertikara” [disgraceful action; opposite of works of eminence] – come upon you at this time of danger?”","“Sama” means the state which is without up and down (without stirring), when – because of the “me and mine” idea not being present – not even a trace of desire remains. Yet, only a kind of “I am I” - difficult to explain – type of “awareness of being” feeling remains. After having attained realization of the “sadhana chatushtaya” [see commentary on sloka 2 of Chapter 1] and having experienced this [aforementioned] state, when one comes down and goes to destroy the seed of samsara, there is “visham” [danger; distress] – meaning: an extreme experience of a disharmonious state comes about. At that time, the awareness of “me,” “mine” and “others” [or: “others'”'] - these three – becomes very strong. From the intense power of a kshatriya [warrior] [being experienced by the sadhak] in Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra, the rajoguna springs forth. The force of saving “me” and destroying “others” becomes quickened, and the divine vision begins to operate. But if one falls into the mire of the treachery of Maya, one sees in the heart – meaning in the middle of the Kutastha-vision – some things like threads, sparks, wheels, zig-zags, twisting lines, colors of many kinds – all kinds of mixed up and convoluted lines, squiggly things wiggling and such. This is what is called “kashmal.” At that time, the intellect is under the power of Avidya and is in delusion, and one feels that the “other” is “my own.” This aberrant state of mind is also called “kashmal.” This “kashmal” is “anAryasevita” [not of service to sages], “asvargya” [does not lead to heaven] and “akeertikara” [disgraceful action; opposite of works of eminence].
 
“AnAryasevita” [not of service to sages]: The one whose mind has taken up the “subtle,” and thus finds Oneness/Equipoise in the world of Consciousness/Spirit – he/she is “arya” [sage]. And the one who loses oneness/equipoise by mixing into the mixture of the physicality in the physical world – it is he/she who is “anarya” [non-sage]. One becomes “anarya” by succumbing to the pull of Maya and falling in distress. Then, because of the inner vision being covered with “kashmal” [confusion], only “kashmal” [nonsensical visual stuff] goes on in the inner vision – meaning: one becomes a servant of “kashmal” [confusion; timidity]. This is why “kashmal” is not of service to sages.
 
“Asvargya” [does not lead to heaven]: “svarga” [heaven] = “sa” + “va” + “r” + “ga”; “sa” - the subtle breath; “va” - void; “r[a]” - power; “ga” - movement. The powerful movement that happens when the subtle breath becomes void is what is verily “svarga” - meaning: the attainment of the Light of the Self. Applying the “ya” (the “y” grammatical device) makes it “svargya” - meaning: that which causes the “attainment of the Light of the Self.” That which causes one to not be able to attain that “attainment of the Light of the Self” – that is what is called “asvargya” (“a”  = lack + “svargya” [attainability of heaven]. When one succumbs to the pull of Maya, the movement becomes “downwards-directed,” and right away, “kashmal” comes forth, and “svarga” (the Light of the Self) is no longer seen, and one becomes progressively covered up with the guna of tamas. That is why “kashmal” “does not lead to heaven.”
 
“Akeertikara”: The renowned identification that comes about from the accomplishment of a “karma” [endeavor] – that is what is known as “keerti” [accomplished act]. Such as: when one takes up samsara [the meaning here is: “life of a householder” or “worldly life”], one is a “samsari” [householder; one whose life is in the world]; when one gets wealth, one is “wealthy”; when one attains knowledge, one is a “scholar”; if one knows science, one is a “scientist”; if one is practiced at yoga, one is a “yogi”; when karmas are finished, one is a “sannyasi,” etc. The complete end of karma is Brahman-ness. But there are many different stages before the complete end [of karma]. Those various stages are individual places of accomplishment. The one who crosses over all of the stages and goes up to the absolute highest stage, that is the one who is “keertiman” [the highly accomplished one]; that is who is “jivanmukta” [Liberated while still living in the physical body]. The “videha-mukti” [Liberation after dropping the body] owned by [that person] is in his/her “hastamal-kavat” [in the person's hands] or under the power of his/her wish/whim. In no way does one who is “veera”[heroic/valiant] succumb to the power of Maya. Regardless of thousands of temptations/pulls [that sadhak] remains in the state of penetrating upwards. It is that sadhak that goes on to rise to the top of accomplishments, unhindered. If, because of the power of time, [that sadhak] has to leave the body before reaching the top, even then [that sadhak] is not stopped. The magnetic, drawing power that was gained by his/her sadhana then becomes extremely strong, and with the speed of lightning, in the blink of an eye, [that power] takes the sadhak across all stages and all the way to the top. That sadhak receives Eternal Life – meaning: attains permanent establishment in the “State of No Return.” That is why it is said in the proverbs: “keertiryasya sa jeevati” [one who is accomplished, lives]. But the one who loses his heroic/valiant nature and is not able to penetrate upwards and gets stuck – “kashmal” appears in front of that [sadhak], covering the sky of consciousness with fog, and it covers up the inner perception of consciousness. That sadhak, now having lost the way and having lost all direction, falls in the cycle of Maya and continuously goes around in circles. For that sadhak there is no more attainment of “keerti” [renowned accomplishment]; there is only “akeerti” [disgraceful lack of accomplishment]. This is because fruitless acts and acts of “asat” [non-spiritual; non-righteous] comprise that which is called “akeerti.” This type of unaccomplished sadhak does not “attain life,” or it happens much later. This is because: just as “keerti” [spiritual accomplishment] makes the jiva cross over all of the karmic boundaries – similarly, “akeerti” [lack of spiritual accomplishment] makes [the jiva] fall to very low stages, or keeps one pulled back and does not allow one to cross over the [karmic] boundaries. Thus, that sadhak has to succumb to the power of [the cycle of] life and death.
 
That is why the Lord is saying: “How did this kind of 'kashmal' come to you? You, the one who by the powers of the current of your Self conquered all – the Earth, the subtle world and such -   and traveled throughout heaven – meaning: moved about in the thousand petals of the Sahasrar [thousand petaled lotus], who received “pashupata” through the blessings of Mahadev [Lord Shiva] – meaning: by submerging yourself in the Brahman-bindu in the middle of the center of the flower of Sahasrar, you received the power of becoming established in Shiva-ness, which destroys all evil in the blink of an eye! Being this kind of a being, this delusional way you are now behaving does not become you.”"
3,"O Partha [Arjuna]! Do not take up the ways of a “kleeba” [eunuch; neuter]. It does not dignify you. O Parantapa [Arjuna], abandon such petty weakness of heart and rise up.","And more, you are the son of Pritha. Your mother is Pritha (“pritha” - throwing; the power of throwing is the mother of the sadhana-life of the sadhak). By the strength of the self-generated power of distinguishing between the gunas and actions, [Pritha – the mother of Arjuna] continuously and always abandoned past conditions because of her own wishes and because of the wishes of others. She even left Shurasena – the giver of her own birth [her birth-father] – and had to become the daughter of Kuntibhoja. That quality of your mother is active in you. So, if you too wish, you can use the strength from that power within you and abandon the Mayic way and take on the Brahman-way. So I am saying: do not take up this kind of “klaibya” [neutered person] quality. “Klaibya” means feeling like a eunuch. It is like the way a “kleeba” (eunuch) is – having neither female-ness nor male-ness, and just going on experiencing only the samsara-suffering. In the same way, in the path of sadhana, one who succumbs to the pull of Maya and loses the masculine principle, that sadhak cannot penetrate above, and because of being under the influence of hope [for Liberation], cannot relax and receive either. That sadhak only experiences the suffering of sadhana. You are “Parantapa” (one who can energize the power of the beyond – meaning: one who has the capability to use the arresting power of Prakriti [Nature]) – meaning: one who is adept at stopping the natural restlessness via subtle pranayam and able to be established in yoga. This kind of neuter-ness (lack of the masculine principle) does not become you. Abandon this petty weakness and be “ut” “tiShTha” (established above). [See sloka in Sanskrit above for the full [compound] word “uttiShTha” stated there.] Among the “da”, “ya”, “pa” and “u” - these four stations1 – at the time of sadhana one has to be settled in the “pa” station and pierce the Kutastha by the use of Shambhavi mudra. This “pa” is below the Ajna and above the Vishuddha, situated at the place where the head and the neck join. Because [this station] is above the five elements, it is called “ut” (above). Turning the tongue backwards, pulling the chin so that it touches the thorax of the throat, sitting with the chest thrust forward, and keeping the spinal column, neck and head aligned straight, and keeping head and neck area taut makes the “pa” and the Ajna chakra – these two stations – line up “on the same thread” [on the same line]. This state of “being on the same thread” is what is called the state of “kapidhvaja” (see the commentary on sloka 20 of Chapter 1). When Mayic worldly matters come to the mind, the two stations [“pa” and Ajna-chakra] no longer remain “on the same thread”; “pa” lowers down a bit, and the Ajna-chakra goes up a bit. This state is what is called “sitting on the chariot.” In order to destroy the seed of samsara, one has to abandon timidity and be on that “same thread.” Then, immediately upon applying Shambhavi mudra, the “kuta” gets pierced; the seed [of samsara] gets buried by the strike of extremely subtle prana and never sprouts again – meaning: through the “thoka” [strike] of breath, the mind dies and Chaitanya Samadhi is attained."
4,[Arjuna said:] O enemy-destroying Madhusudan! How can I employ my arrows and weapons and fight this war against the venerable Bhishma and Drona?,"There are two powers that are continuously working in the body of the jiva. One is “Nara” [human]; the other is “Narayana” [Divine]. Nara, abiding in the Muladhar, is trying to absorb the consciousness-substance in the worldliness-oriented “ignorance-natured tamoguna,” and Narayana, abiding in the Sahasrar, is trying to bring the consciousness-substance into the “knowledge-natured tamoguna,” and preside over [the consciousness-substance]. The result of this “trying” – meaning: the aggregate of these two powers' strengths together – is the “jiva-bhava” [jiva-condition; jiva-ness] or “jivatva” [jiva-ness]. Just as the consciousness-substance – meaning: mind – is helpless to the pulls of those two powers – similarly, prana is also helpless – one time within, another time outside, going round and round like a weaver's spinning wheel. Mind – subtle and free; prana – physical and enslaved; mind – the living-ness; prana – life being lived;  the difference between [mind and prana] is only this much. That Nara-Narayana is also called “Maya-Brahman” or “Mayic Shakti” or “Brahmi-shakti.” Just as soon as one tries to leave Maya and go to Brahman, right away Maya starts pulling [on the jiva]. At that time, mind – like the swing of life [alternate meaning: like the swinging of prana] – goes on swinging between Maya and Brahman – meaning: at one time rises up through the strength of Self-Awareness, and then again comes down because of the errors of world-awareness. In Self-Awareness - “It is I Who is the presence of all and it is from Me that everything is present” - this type of state of Independence comes about. In the world-awareness - “you are the all-knowing guru; I am the ignorant disciple” - this type of enslaved state comes about. These two states are what are called, respectively, “Atma-bhava” and “jiva-bhava.” The doubt and conflict of the jiva-bhava finds resolution in Atma-bhava. This discussion between Arjuna and Sri Krishna is actually the jiva-bhava and Atma-bhava – doubt/conflict and resolution [respectively]. These two are only different states of the same being. I am the one who understands; I am the One Who makes me understand. Succumbing to the pull of Maya is [the state of] Arjuna, not succumbing is Bhagavan [Lord]. In the chamber of the Self in the path of sadhana, it is this that is realized directly.
 
Dear sadhak, now you understand – what the [real] meaning of “arjuna uvAcha” [Arjuna said] and “sribhagavAnuvAcha” [the Lord said] is.
 
“SAṃkhya”: “Saṃ” = whole; “kha” = space; “ya” = vehicle; “a” = settledness – meaning: casting off the “I am the body” idea, settling wholly in the vehicle of space (in “chidakash” [the space of consciousness]). The teaching in Ashtavakra Samhita - “yadi dehaṃ pṛthaka kṛtya chiti vishrAmya tiShThasi” [if, knowing that you are distinct from the body, you establish yourself in a state of resting in consciousness] is exemplified by this word [saṃkhya]. The complete sloka [from Ashtavakra Samhita] associated with this teaching has been translated in Bengali [and explained] in a footnote in the 9th sloka of Chapter 3 in this Gita. One will be able to understand the essential meaning [of that sloka and this teaching] by reading that [section].
 
“IShubhih”: If the Atma-mantra and “hangsa” are united together, prana becomes extremely subtle and intensely quickened. That is what is called “iShu” or “baan” [arrow] (a thing that pierces). It is by the progressive and regular striking of that subtle prana that all of the inner coverings are pierced [or: cut asunder].
 
The sadhak (Arjuna) has readied him/herself to destroy the seed of samsara, but, because of true knowledge being covered up due to Mayic confusion, many doubts are coming up for him/her. So, [the sadhak] is looking to the Atma-bhava Madhusudan and thinking, “Being separated from the body, and merging the mind into the space-equilibrium, how will I be able to strike with the breath by driving the subtle prana and thus kill the mind? This means: [how will I destroy] the “I-ness” (Bhishma) of the mind and the mind-driven intellect (Drona)? At that time the power to do “'mantra' ut-charan” [ordinary meaning: pronunciation of mantra; the meaning here: to ride the mantra above] becomes contracted; how would it be possible [at that time] to draw prana? And more, it is through this “I-ness” that I grow, and it is through this [samsaric] intellect that I get my greater awareness, or revelations. Through the power of this “I-ness” I have made the universe “I”-filled, and through the power of the Prakritic intellect, I have ascertained the knowledge of substances and have become learned in the sciences and have become a receiver of revelations. For these reasons, these two [“I-ness” and the samskaric intellect] are actually worthy of worship. They are certainly not things to be destroyed.” This kind of delusion is coming about.
"
5,"If I have to eat by begging because I am refraining from killing all of these noble venerable ones – even that [begging to eat] is better for me. But, if we kill these persons [from the side of Dhritarashtra], then we will have to experience, right here in this world, the consequences of the blood-killing of relatives.","So, if because of not destroying these two powerful ones [“I-ness” and samskaric intellect], I have to experience lack (“bhaikshya” [beggar-condition]) in this world because of the karma from this desire [to not kill them] – meaning: remaining under the rulership of Prakriti – even that is good. But destroying these two and gaining rulership over Prakriti is not good. This is because if the “I-ness” does not remain, then the sensory experience does not remain, and if the Prakritic intellect does not remain, then good and bad do not remain. In that condition, [desiring] worldly enjoyments, or living in the body, is nothing but being ridiculous. It is like when there is an illness on the tongue that makes one not be able to taste, and because of that, the pleasurable food becomes full of unpleasantness/painful – it is like that. “Gurun” [see third line of the sloka above] [in the spiritual case] is the pluralized form of “gaurav” [pride]."
6,"If we are victorious, or if they are victorious over us – which among these two [possibilities] is more weighty for us? I cannot understand even this! Those – killing whom I do not even want to live – those same persons of the side of Dhritarasthra are in front of me.","After thinking like that [in the previous sloka], [the sadhak is] again thinking: “Oh right! Wait. Which one is good? Is it better to remain under the power of Prakriti, or is it better to bring Prakriti under one's power? By remaining under the power of Prakriti, the seed of samsara does not get destroyed. And then again, worldly enjoyments do not remain if one brings Prakriti under one's power. Those with whom I would enjoy the things of the world – killing whom there is no purpose for living – because of that I have no wish to live – all of those mental vrittis are here in front of me. That is what it is! What do I do!”"
7,"In what kind of way can I live after killing my relatives? This desperation as well as [the thought that] destroying lineage will cause sin – thinking in this erroneous way [or: thinking about sin] has caused my normal nature (“shaurya” [splendor]) to be overcome with confusion. And a doubt has come up: “Is taking up the act of begging appropriate to the dharma of kshatriyas?” So I am asking You [Sri Krishna], tell me what is best for me with certainty. I am Your disciple. I surrender to You. Please teach me.","In this sloka, the sadhak is completely abandoning the vanity of doership and surrendering to the feet of guru. [The sadhak] is saying, “Being taken over by affectionate attachment, my power of reasoning and understanding has become covered up. Even the chitta has become deluded on the subject of dharma. So I ask You [Sri Krishna], please tell me, with certainty, what is best. I am [Your] disciple. I take refuge in you. Advise me as to what I should do.” Unless one accepts and admits disciple-ness and surrenders, the teachings on spirituality cannot be had. Just as this is true in the outer [world], it is the same in the inner [world]. This is because: it is seen that if one does not abandon ahaṃkar [ego] (the feeling of doership) and does not devotedly surrender to the feet of guru during the practice of Kriya – in no way does the inner vision open; neither is spiritual knowledge gained. So, to admit disciple-ness to the satguru is what is being taught in this sloka."
8,"Even if I get uncontested rulership over all of the kingdoms of the world, or even over the gods, I still do not see anything that will remove this grief that is desiccating my senses.","“Bhoomi” = field – [meaning:] this body; “asapatna” = without enemies; the “daivic” opposition [opposition arising from the subtle body], vrittis of “asat” [unholiness; unrighteousness] and the aberrations of natural ways – these three are the “enemies.” Whatever goes on to be known through the practice of asana, pranayam and such – only that much becomes “rulership of a kingdom without enemies.” At that time, the yoga-siddhis [yogic powers] that are attained through particular Kriyas, that is what is called “riddhi” or “vibhuti” [wondrous/miraculous things/powers]. It is when one becomes “dressed with 'vibhuti'” through perfection in yoga that the body becomes a kingdom without enemies and a place of wonders.
 
“Sura” [demi-god; or: melody] (“sa” + “u” + “ra”): “sa” = divinity - “prANohi bhagaVaneeshah” [prana is the divine power] – therefore it is prana; “u” = the settling in Sahasrar; “ra” = power/light. The blaze of Energy/Light that is revealed when prana becomes Still at the Sahasrar – that is “sura.” The Power that comes about when mind is merged into the “Naad-bindu” [the bindu of Sound] in the front and back of that Light – that is what is called “surANAṃ Adhipatyaṃ” [rulership over the gods].
 
The sadhak is at this time absorbed in ignorance. That is why he/she is not able to see that if that kind of [aforementioned] attainment in yoga is had, then there is nothing left for which one would grieve. [The sadhak] is despairing because of thinking of things [from an ignorant state of being].
"
9,"Sanjaya said: Gudakesh Parantapa Arjuna, after saying all of this to Hrishikesh, said “I will not fight” to “Govinda” and became silent.","When Gudakesh Parantapa Arjuna (the sadhak) goes on speaking in the previously seen ways [in the previous slokas], at that time, he has a direct encounter with Kutastha Chaitanya in the form of Hrishikesh – meaning: [the sadhak] sees that it is actually Kutastha Chaitanya that is presiding as the ruler over all of the senses. After that, whatever the sadhak becomes intent on, [like] “I won't fight the war [do Kriya] any more (whatever happens, let it happen), right then the form of “Govinda” appears. (“Go” = the whole of the universe; this body of the five elements; “vid” = knowing; the One Who is the Knower of the universe, the Witness, the Foundation – it is He Who is “Govinda.”). This means: Seeing Kutastha-Brahman as the Total Witness and the Foundation of this entire formed-universe, the sadhak directly realizes: “all is He.” When this happens, the non-involved feeling blossoms forth. At that time, the sadhak becomes totally silent. The state devoid of any activity [or: this state of complete silence] is called “tushnibhava.” In this state, all of the senses take a respite from their individual activities, and mind, having given up trying and not taking up anything as a support, remains just as it is within itself. It is not possible to avoid calling this “tushnibhava” by the names of “Gudakesh” and “Parantapa.” The one who has overcome sleep (laziness), the one who has learned to “put sleep to sleep,” the one who – because of having brought sleep completely under his power – [who,] even at the habitual time of sleeping, does not fall into the dream-delusion of the mire of Maya – meaning: the one who - during in the “waking dream” - always remains in the Consciousness of the Self – that one is “Gudakesh.” And the one who has become an “asana-siddha” [one who has perfected/conquered the seated posture] – meaning: the kinds of troubles that used to come up because of the [physical and subtle] tendons and pathways being blocked by the gross [humors] vayu-pitta-kapha [air-bile-phlegm], like: needing to massage the knees, the back and such being tense and agitated – the one who, through determined and steady practice, has destroyed all of those [afflictions] and is able to effortlessly sit in a still-posture for a long time, for whom no desperation/comes, instead he/she feels the great comfort that comes from lying down when he/she sits in asana – in short, the one who cannot be deterred from his own endeavor by any of the soldiers of Prakriti – that is the one who is “Parantapa.”"
10,"O Bharat [Dhritarashtra]! Hrishikesh began to laugh, and, in the place situated between the soldiers of both sides, said these words to the despondent Arjuna. ","Just as that kind of [aforementioned] “tushnibhava” comes forth, Hrishikesh begins to laugh – meaning: the rays of the tenderly brilliant Light fills and fully radiates the inner sky; the heart becomes filled with thrilling joy. (That Light – that Bliss – cannot be described by language. One who – having given up doership as stated in slokas 6 and 7 [of this Chapter 2], and thus having become a blindly-following disciple – has reached that state of non-doing silence – only that one sees [this Light] and understands.) But because at this time the mind, even though staying just as itself within itself [and not taking any support], is situated between the present vrittis divided into two sides, the “despondent feeling” part still remains in [the sadhak]. Then, from the Kutastha, spoken teachings come forth softly — Begin Footnote. —  If one keeps a sattvic diet, conducts oneself with sattvic behavior, and follows the instructions of guru in a sattvic way, within a time that is not lengthy, the Gita and Gayatri [sacred mantra] go on being spoken [within] automatically and on their own. This can be heard. This is why the Vedas and Upanishads are called “shruti” [that which is heard]. The spiritual teachings are not created by human beings. The one who, with sincere faith, goes on the path instructed by satguru – he/she is the one who knows the truth of this. And the one who will continue to move [on the path] – he/she will also be able [to know the truth of this]. It cannot be known or made known by language or by guessing/inferential logic! If one is a bhogi [immersed enjoyer] of worldly enjoyments, this state cannot be known. — End Footnote. — (the feeling/experience springs up). The one who has been in that state and has heard those teachings – it is he/she who can truly be called fortunate. That is the one whose life is truly successful; that is [the sadhak] who is truly a “person.”"
11,"[The Lord said:] You [Arjuna] are grieving over things which are not to be grieved over, and at the same time, you are also speaking like a knowledgeable person. But knowledgeable people do not grieve over anyone at all – whether alive or dead.","Those who abide in the “paravastha” of Kriya [“paravastha” = poise after Kriya; or the “post-Kriya state”], they do not see restlessness/movement or stillness (“alive or dead”) - nothing at all. You [Arjuna] are not abiding in that Settledness, yet you are speaking about that abidance. But everything [you are experiencing now] is in a restless and unsettled state.
 
In the daily practice of Kriya, one must not get up and leave the asana [seat and seated posture] right after finishing Kriya; instead, one has to sit for a while in a settled posture and focus on Kutastha with a one-pointed mind. No other kind of Kriya should be done [at this time]. At that time, due to “accumulation” from the practice of Kriya, the mind forgets about the external things and sees and hears supernatural happenings in the inner world[s]. For as long as this state remains – for that long is the “paravastha” of Kriya. During the time-span of the experience of this state, the sadhak goes on gaining Knowledge/Wisdom. For this reason, he/she becomes like a “pandit” [knowledgeable person]. When Perfection is attained in sadhana, this state becomes permanent; it never breaks again. Then there is nothing over which to grieve. Directly realizing the matters of phenomena, such as creation-sustenance-destruction etc., the sadhak then attains the Bliss-filled, “no-grief” state. But for as long as Perfection is not attained, because of which the Universal Form is not seen – for that long, during the waking state, that state of being a “pandit” comes up to the mind only as a shadow [of the real state]. The real “no-grief” state does not come. Yes, one may speak like a pandit, but the weakness of the heart does not go away. It is that very condition – being experienced here by Arjuna – that is being pointed out in this sloka."
12,That there was a time when I was not – that is not how it is; that you were not – that is also not how it is. That these kings were not – that is not how it is. That we will not continue after this – that is also not how it is.,"“I” = the “Self-ness,” or Paramatman [Supreme Self]; “you” = the “jiva-ness”; “janAdheepa” [rulers of people] - “jana” [people] = the aggregate of the vrittis of the antahkarana [inner operators]; “adheepa” = those among [the aforementioned vrittis] that are primary. This conscious body that has come about with the combination of the “Self-ness” and the “jiva-ness” - these jiva-ness and Self-ness were there before this body's coming into existence; the inner vrittis were also there. If they were not there, they would not have come together/combined now. The reason is this: the past and present are bound by the bindings of karma. If the bindings are not undone, this combination [“Self-ness”, “jiva-ness” etc.] will continue later as well – meaning: again there will be “I”, “you”, “these people”  - all of this [will happen again].
 
In the wheel of Time, as the dharma of the particular “yugas” [epochs] appears in the progression of the “manvantara” [the age of “Manu” and the span of time containing the four yugas], the deliverance of sages, the destruction of evil-doers and the establishment of dharma becomes necessary because of the law of regulation/balance. And whenever there is the decline of dharma and the flourishing of adharma [unrighteousness; ungodliness], it is then, due to the law of regulation/balance, a Deific Form appears in order to fulfill that longing for deliverance, appropriate to the time and place. That Deific Form is known by names such as “Rama,” “Shyam” [Sri Krishna], “Buddha,” “Kalki,” “Jesus,” “Muhammad,” “Chaitanya” etc. How many times and in how many forms that “Rama,” “Shyam” etc. have come – there is no way of keeping track of such. It is impossible to limit the Infinite. If the operative aspects of [personal and phenomenal] nature and character are carefully examined, it is seen that character and nature take turns [in doing the same activities] – meaning: revolves (round and round) [repeats again and again] – according to the progression [of the times], and they produce the same kinds of operative conditions [in every round]. Thus, “the decline of dharma and the flourishing of adharma” is an expected operative condition. When this operative condition appears, then, in order to produce the [righteous] condition that is appropriate for the time, the Deific Form, which is associated with “Self-ness,” appears. As long as there has been, is and will be a world, for so long has there been, is, and will be the incarnation of this Deific Form.

13,"The kinds of mutations of conditions – such as childhood, youth, old age – that are there for this (physical) body of the jiva – it is the same after the end of the body. Therefore, a person who is “dheera” [steady and composed] does not get deluded by that.","Like the way different kinds of conditions come about one after the other for this [physical] body (yet no change happens to the embodied one; one stays as one is) – in the same way, the different kinds of bodies that one receives after death according to the state of consciousness at the time of death – such as demi-god, human, mammal, bird etc. - those different kinds of bodies that are received are also the same thing (the change is only in the condition and appearance; the jiva's “jiva-ness” does not go away; that remains just as it is. In this, [the person who is] “dheera” — Begin Footnote. — “VikArahetau sati vikriyante yeShAṃ na chaitAṃsi ta eva dheerAh” - meaning: the one who does not vary his/her state [get disturbed] even when a cause for the varying of the state [cause for disturbance] is present – that is the one who is called “dheera” [steady and composed]. — End Footnote. — (“dhee” = intellect; the “ra” substance [or: the linguistic root “ra”] = to hold – meaning: one who attains settledness in the field of the intellect – that particular person) does not become deluded. Applying the “vritti of certainty,” that person ascertains Sat and asat, and takes his/her place in Sat alone. That person does not fall into the delusion of asat."
"14,15","O Kaunteya [son of Kunti, or Arjuna]! All “matrasparsha” [contacts with the elements] (meaning: all of the worldly experiences conjoined with the vrittis [active components] of the senses) produce [experiences of] cold, heat, pleasure, pain [etc.]; those all come and go (endowed with “rising up and ending”); therefore they are impermanent. O Bharat [in this case: Arjuna]! Endure all such things. O “Purusharshabha” [man amongst men]! The steady and composed person who sees all of these (“matrasparsha”) - along with pleasure and pain – as the same, and who is not pained by them – it is that person who is fit to receive Immortality (Liberation).","The eleven vrittis [active components] of the senses, including the mind, are called “matra.” The bumping together of these with the objects of phenomena is called “matrasparsha” [contact with “matra”]. From that bumping together, [the experiences of] cold, heat, pleasure, pain [etc.] arise. And because those [experiences] are “endowed with 'rising up and ending,'” they are impermanent. For this reason, one has to endure those [experiences] through “titiksha” [practice of endurance] – meaning: one has to be “duhkheShu anudvignamanAh sukheShu vigataspṛha” [unperturbed in suffering [and] detached in happiness] and tolerate them. During the time of going up the brahmanadi within the sushumna, while continuously doing “mamanusmaran” [meditating on the Self] chakra by chakra, many types of deluding/entrancing happenings come forth trying to attract one into partaking in different aspects of the sound-touch-sight-taste-smell experiences. If one becomes enchanted/deluded by them and the mind contacts them, then one becomes bound by them. But “bhoga” [enjoyment/partaking] does not remain forever; in due time, they finish. The thing that remains is the samskara-bondage [left over from those bhoga experiences]. By not giving a single glance to any of those worldly experiences, making the mind focused, pointing one's steady attention as fine as a needle towards the bindu in Kutastha and becoming ecstatically absorbed in that – one can have Immortality.  "
16,Asat [the untrue] does not exist; the existence of Sat [Truth] also cannot be denied. The “tattva-darshis” [wise seers] have seen into the farthest depths of both of these.,"“Tattva” = the essence of “vastu” [substances]. “Vastu” are of two types – Sat [True] and asat [untrue]. Sat = Atman [Self]; asat = everything except that Atman/Self – meaning: the substances from the 24 divisions of the sectionalized Prakriti are also known as “avastu” [non-substances]. Perception is of two types, “anuloma” [in a natural direction – typically analogous with hair] and “viloma” [in the opposite of a natural direction – typically analogous with hair]. Looking from the root to the tip [of the hair [analogously] – meaning: outward] is “viloma” perception. This is “creation-orientation.” Looking from the tip to the root [of the hair [analogously] – meaning: inward] is “anuloma” perception. This is “Liberation-orientation.” Because one's perception is towards the tip in creation-orientation, it [perception] gets covered all over by the darkness of ignorance due to the turmoil of the many waves of worldly experiences. The True Form of the Self is not seen. When one is in Liberation-orientation and acting from that, the search for the “cause” is continuous, and perception becomes locked in the “root” alone. That is why, through the Light of Knowledge, the witnessing of the True Form of the Self goes on happening. Then both of the “panchikrita” [quintuplicated; created by “the five”] and the “apanchikrita” [non-quintuplicated; uncreated by “the five” - such as: mind] versions of the five primal elements change from the physical to the very subtle state, and one comes to know the following transformations: how earth merges into water, water into fire, fire into air, air into space/ether, space/ether into the tanmatras [the source of the senses] etc. After the perception of a separate existence of all of these is ended, only “karan” [cause] remains. This can be seen. Within that “karan” is the “Beeja” [Seed]. That [Seed] has no cause. It has no kind of erosion, expansion or change. This Seed is, verily, Sat [Truth]. Those who are “tattva-darshis” [seers] from the perception of Liberation-orientation – they know the final truth of both Sat and asat – meaning: they know that asat has no separate existence of its own. Existence is only Sat's."
17,The One Who pervades this entire creation – know Him to be the Indestructible. No one can destroy this “Avyaya” [Inexhaustible].,"Just as a claypot is nothing but clay made up of the atoms and particles [of clay] and nothing else; if one breaks the pot, the clay remains just as clay – the Self and this universe are the same. Whether the universe is broken down or built up, the Self remains as It is. This universe is Atman-filled [Self-filled]. Therefore, there is no place which is without the Self. Just as: ice, liquid, steam are three forms of water and have three names; the substance remains the same as it is; there is only the difference in the states and their names – in the same way, jiva, Maya, Brahman are the states of the same Atman [Self] with different names. That is why the Self is “Avyaya” - meaning: cannot be spent. Thus, when Someone is this kind of Indestructible, how can That One be destroyed?"
18,"It is said that all of these bodies - belonging to the Indestructible, Immeasurable and Eternal Self – are called “anitya” [impermanent; temporal] (endowed with “end”/destructible). Therefore, O Bharat [Arjuna]! Fight.","After speaking about the subject of the macrocosm in the previous two slokas, now the subject of the body and the embodied – meaning: the microcosm – is being specifically addressed. If one wants to discuss the relationship between these two cosmos [micro and macro], it can be said thusly: as the force of wind goes across a mass of water, innumerable waves-foam-bubbles appear (the water that is only the physical form of that air and nothing else), and then after a few moments (with the wind subsiding) they disappear; the water portion goes to the water and the air portion goes to the air; the illusory vision of the rising wave is no longer there; without disturbance, things remain steady – just like that, in the macrocosm, each body appears because of the conjunction with Consciousness/Spirit, and later (with the disjunction from Consciousness/Spirit) is destroyed. The “embodied” - meaning: Consciousness/Spirit – is Eternal, Indestructible (Infinite) and without attributes; and this body, because it is a permutation of Maya, is “endowed with change” (“antavanta” [having an end] [see sloka above for the word]) and impermanent. This is a firm assertion (declared). Therefore, instead of giving into undue affection and attachment to this body, fight – meaning: engage yourself in Layayoga [the yoga of merging/dissolving] in the sadhana-battle."
19,"The one who thinks that this Self can be killed, and the one who thinks that this [Atman/Self] is dead – both of them are not aware of the truth, because this Self does not kill anyone, nor does It die by anyone's doing.","Dear sadhak – you go above and see. The Self is Total/Complete, and One Self is Itself the world/creation. Because there is no “two,” killer and killed – this simply is not possible at all. As long as one is in the worldly experience, for that long is the vision covered by ignorance. Greater vision or the vision of the subtle does not happen [in that state]. Thus, in that veiled vision, the feelings of “killer and killed” spring up. But, in Layayoga [the yoga of merging/dissolving], the distortion disappears immediately after crossing past the worldly experience. Ignorance is annihilated. The vision/perception becomes clear, and one sees the True Form of the All-pervading, Inexhaustible, Indestructible Self."
20,"This Self does not ever take birth, nor does It ever die; having been, never will it not be. It is “Aja” [Unborn/Primal], “Nitya” [Eternal], “Shashvata” [Imperishable] and “Purana” [Ancient/Ageless]. It does not die with the death of the body.","“Aja” [Unborn/Primal]  = That which never takes birth, nor does It die. “Nitya” [Eternal] = That which always Is. “Shashvata” [Imperishable] = Indestructible. “Purana” [Ancient/Ageless] = the One Who existed before creation and exists even after destruction [of phenomena]. Because the Self is of this Character/Nature, even when the body is killed, It does not die. The body/bodies is/are called “kosha[s]” [sheath[s]]. There are five koshas: “annamaya” [food-filled], “pranamaya” [prana-filled], “manomaya” [mind-filled], “vijnanamaya” [filled with subtle knowing] and “anandamaya” [bliss-filled]. The first two make up the physical body; the second two make up the subtle body; and the last one is the causal body. In Layayoga [the yoga of merging/dissolving], when one [kosha] is destroyed, it changes/merges into another [kosha subsequently higher]. In the end, there is the “total merging/dissolving” in the True Substance. Like it is said: “jaler bimba, jale uday, lay hoye se mishay jale” [a slight variation on a line of poetry by the Bengali mystic poet Ramprasad – meaning: the water's bubble rises from water, after “laya” [dissolution] it merges back into water]."
21,"O Partha [Arjuna]! The person who knows this Self to be without birth, without destruction, Eternal and Indestructible – in what way can that person cause to get someone killed, and whom? And how and whom does that person kill?","The one (upon the performance of special Kriya) who goes above and knows (experiences directly) the Self to be Indestructible, Eternal, Ageless and Inexhaustible (devoid of diminution), that one attains “Purush” [[Supreme] Person] - meaning: that [sadhak] attains the “avyaktAt para” [the Supreme Inexpressible] – that Supreme Destiny. In Him (since everything becomes One), no reason remains to cause anyone to kill anyone. So, who does what? Just by being a jiva, the jiva is Prakriti. But just upon crossing beyond the world-experience, one casts off one's “Prakriti-ness” and becomes “Purush” or Shiva. The activities of Prakriti do not touch Purush."
22,"Just as people throw away all old and worn-out clothes and take on all new clothes to wear – in the same way, all of the old and worn-out bodies are cast off and one takes on different bodies.","The “death” that is seen in the world/samsara – that is just like the taking off of old clothes and the putting on of new clothes; it is only a change of covering. The jiva leaves the old, non-functioning body and takes on another, new body. "
"23,24","None of the weapons can cut this Self; fire cannot burn it; water cannot wet It; even air cannot dry It. It is uncuttable; It is nonflammable, non-wettable, and cannot be dried. It is Eternal, All-pervading, Stable (Still in Its nature), Unmoving (always the Same) and Primeval (without beginning). ","All of the phenomena that have come forth from the mutations of Maya cannot exercise any power on/over the Immutable. Weapons of all kinds, fire, water, air – all of these are Prakriti, as well as the distortions of Prakriti and its mutations. Therefore, the Self cannot be cut by weapons, burned by fire, wetted by water, or dried by air. For this reason the Self is uncuttable, nonflammable, non-wettable, and cannot be dried. It is Eternal, All-pervading, unshakeable and immovable like a tree cut to its stump, and is without beginning."
25,"It is said that this Self is Inexpressible, Unthinkable, and Immutable. Therefore, knowing that the Self is like this, it is not appropriate for you [Arjuna] to grieve like this.","In the 23rd sloka [of this Chapter 2], it has been stated that the Self is unaffected by earth, water, fire and air. And now, in this sloka [25 of Chapter 2] it is being said that even space cannot touch the Self, because It is “Avyakta” [Inexpressible; Unspeakable] – meaning: because of being extremely Subtle, it cannot be revealed even through sound [the sense aspect associated with the element of space]. The antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] cannot grasp It because It is “Achintya” [Unthinkable] – meaning: It is not even able to be contemplated. The Self is “Avikarya” [Immutable] – meaning: beyond Maya (all mutations that there are – those happen in Maya alone; they do not happen in the Self; it is like trying to spray ink on space). You yourself have the practical experience of these states – meaning: having gone above the Kutastha [alternate translation: having gone to the top of Kutastha], you have known this through your own awareness and have spoken about it (“uchyate” [declared]). Therefore, knowing the Self in this way, it is not fitting for you to grieve like this."
"26,27","And even if you take It [Atman/Self] to be always being born and always dying, then O Mahabaho! [mighty-armed; Arjuna]! - even then you cannot grieve of the Self. This is because: one who has been born – it is certain that that person will die. Therefore, it is not appropriate for you to grieve over these inevitable matters.","Even if you let go of your sadhana-acquired Knowledge of the Eternity of the Self, and take up the samsaric practice of thinking that It (Atman/Self) is always born and always dies – even then, it is not right for you to grieve. This is because: being born means that one has to die, and again, if one dies, then one has to be born. This is the absolutely pure truth. What are “birth” and “death”? Taking on the covering of name and form by Consciousness is “birth”; being without that covering is “Liberation.” And, not being careful at the time of extinguishing one's last breath, and thereby causing a change in the “covering,” is called “death.” That very covering is the body. That [body] is of three types: physical, subtle and causal. The physical body: is built by the quintuplicated [separated] five primal elements, made to contain/store bhoga [worldly partaking], and endowed with the six mutations [physical constituents] – meaning: it is the body made of bones, flesh etc. The subtle body: is built by the non-quintuplicated [unseparated] five primal elements, made for the contemplation of bhoga [desiring, rejecting] and is conjoined to the “saptadasha kalaas” [seventeen functionalities]. (Five organs of perception, five organs of action, five pranas, mind and intellect – these seventeen are called “saptadasha kalaas.”) Even though the physical body lies unmoving in bed during the time of sleep, the body that carries on the activities of dreams – that is what is known as the “subtle body.” And the causal body is nothing but the Avidya [Primal Ignorance] form causing these two [aforementioned] bodies, or the “seed.” Just before death, the jiva becomes devoid of physical-external consciousness and abides in the subtle body. At that time, all of the acts that the jiva has done present themselves in front of him/her and they get ready to produce their fruits. At this time, all of the pure, Truth-directed acts of the sadhana-perfected yogi shine forth the Light of Consciousness (like the light and heat of the sun dispelling fog) and destroy all of the coverings. Thus, the sadhak attains Liberation – meaning: all of the bodies are cast off together right at the same time of casting off the physical body, and that sadhak never has to take on another body again. But the non-sadhak, or the sadhak who has not yet attained perfection, because of being bound to karma, is not able to see the Light of Consciousness at this time, and only goes on seeing the matters of sound and sight and such [sensory matters]. That jiva is not able to cut through or destroy the covering[s]. Therefore, even though that jiva casts of the physical body, the subtle and causal bodies remain. Then that jiva, traveling in a dream-like state with all of the vrittis [active components] of the senses and attached to samskaras, goes on to move through/examine all of the vrittis and samskaras like an “AkAshastha nirAlamba vayubhoota” [supportless, airy spirit in space]. This is verily the post-death [of the physical body] state of that jiva. But, just as: when a seed falls on the field, it becomes the form of a tree through the help of time – in the same way, jiva-consciousness, which is inside the “field” of the forms of the subtle and causal bodies, in due time and according to the samskaras – meaning: the habitual general state of consciousness that was being experienced at the time of death – that jiva again takes on a physical body according to that general state of consciousness. This is verily that jiva's rebirth. Thus, for as long as the covering is not completely removed by the totally eliminating karma – for that long does the jiva continue to take on and cast off bodies in that way – meaning: birth and death continue to happen. This birth and death are of two types: of the breath, and of the body. By taking in the breath, one supports life, and at the end of having it and experiencing it, one has to let it go. This “taking in” and “letting go” of the breath is called the “birth” and “death”, respectively, of the breath. As long as there is life, for so long does this flow of the birth and death of the breath continue. As well, in just the same way, as long as there is “jiva-ness,” for that long does the flow of the “birth and death of the body” continue. The jiva takes on one body, at the end of partaking in it, it casts off that [body]. And in order to experience the [fruits of the] accumulated mass of karmas, it again takes on a new body. Just as, upon having taken on life, the breath has to be inhaled and exhaled until that life ends – in that same way, until the end of “jiva-ness” (by the finishing of the mass of accumulated karmas), one has to take on and cast off bodies. This is inevitable. Therefore, it is not appropriate for you to grieve over inevitable matters."
28,"All phenomena (all living beings), in the beginning (before creation) are unexpressed (unmanifested); in the middle (for some time) are expressed (manifested); and after death again become unexpressed. Thus, what is there in this [situation] that is causing you to grieve and lament?","All that are bound to beginning, end and middle are phenomena. Therefore, this bhoga-storing body, the antahkarana, and the activities of the different conglomerates of the arteries, veins, tendons and other channels and such, all using the foundation of the different vrittis – these are all phenomena. What the state is before the arising (the birth) of these phenomena – no one can see this. And what kind of state there is after the ending of their existence (dying) – that also no one knows. These two are inexpressible. Only that middle state between the arising and ending is expressed – meaning: able to be grasped by the senses – a manifestation of the normal vibrating aspect, the activity of the three gunas. This is a Prakritic regularity - “avashyambhAvi” [a “must happen”]. What is there to be sorrowful about in this? Or what is there about which to lament? And see even more: you are “Bharat[a]” (“bha” = luminescence; the Light of the Self; + “rat[a]” = absolutely engaged) – meaning: having directly experienced the Light of the Self during the practice of yoga, you have become enjoined with That, and by the help of that Light, you have seen with the inner perception within the yogic path that: Maya, who is within Brahman, — Begin Footnote. — Just as: although Truth is Real without end, yet one accepts, through imagination, the False which has no reality – Maya being within Brahman is like that. — End Footnote. —the One Who is Unexpressed – Mula – it is from That Unexpressed One that this tri-guna-endowed, twenty-four kalaa-aspected, Prakritic world has been created (see Chapter Fourteen). In Layayoga, all of this, like the way the spider itself draws back within itself the threads of the spider-web, dissolves back into that Unexpressed. Only the middle, active state between the beginning of creation and its end is expressed. Its beginning is that same Inexpressible; its end is also that same Inexpressible. Seeing that everything is in this way, why are you grieving for all of this? Don't. Do not put on the noose of your endearing wishes around your throat. “Pratibuddhasya svapnadṛShTavastuShviva shokah na yujyate” [after awakening, it is not appropriate to grieve over something seen in the dream] – meaning: the person who becomes “pratibuddha” (wakes up after sleep has ended) – just as that person does not grieve over the things seen in the dream-state – similarly, you have also awakened (as the density of ignorance became dispelled through sadhana, you came to know that all of the samsaric scenarios are like a dream, impermanent and illusory/false). In such a situation, it is not fitting for you to grieve."
29,"Some see this [Atman/Self] as wondrous; others see this as full of wonders; again some hear this as wondrous; some, even after hearing, are not able to know this.","Dear sadhak, that day when, by satguru's grace, you saw Yourself for the first time, did you not spontaneously feel that as being wondrous (that which I do not know – that is why it is wondrous)? When you had the chance to talk in some place about that Extraordinarily Beautiful Form – because of not being able to find words for that Beautiful Form, you were not able to speak about it – did you not feel the great wonder at that time? And again remember: that “Naad” [Divine Sound] in the womb of the Pranava, the “Bindu” in the womb of the Naad – from that “Ardhanarishwara” [Form of the Lord as half Shiva and half Shakti] Bindu (the Bindu blossoms into two Bindus), when Prakriti came out for the first time – dancing and dancing, and at that time Purush also went on dancing (the vibration of both Bindus); because the vibration of Purush appears in a much greater way, it is called “tandava” [heavy, wild dance]; and because the vibration of Prakriti can be grasped, it is called “lasya” [sensuous dance]. Thus: from the “ta” of “tandava,” and the “la” of “lasya,” the word “tala” [rhythmic cycle in music] comes into being. In the womb of the Unbroken-Naad [unbroken Divine Sound], the consonantal sounds matching Prakriti's rhythmic dance steps – that is called “chanda” [measured beat; rhyme]. And again, this “chanda,” because of the varying durations in sound – such as short, long, sustained etc., and variations in expression – such as heavy or light, can be heard as seven “swaras” [melodic tones making up the musical octave]. When you first heard those sounds, were you not completely stunned, and then steeped in wonder? Okay! And then, when you, right after that [experience], due to the intensity of Ecstasy, were completely drowned in the Ocean of Divine Consciousness, where your “I-ness” ended – were you able to know anything at that time? Was there any “knowingness”? When even “I” is not there, who is to know whom/what? You can see that this sloka matches up with the things of that State that you experienced."
30,"O Bharat [Arjuna]! This embodied One (the Self) is eternally abiding in every body and cannot be killed. Therefore, do not grieve over all of this phenomena.","Dear sadhak! You are “Bharat” - the consciousness abiding in the Light of the Self. You know, and you have directly experienced, that this embodied Consciousness-Self (“dehi” [the embodied]) – It is present in every body, and cannot be killed in any situation. Whatever there is in this world that is “gain and loss” oriented, whether it is conscious or inert, or germinating – all of that is “body” [material]. Therefore, they are all endowed with the six mutations [existence, birth, growth, change, decay and death]. There are changes of the states of those bodies, or there is the destruction of those bodies, but there is no change or death for the Self. It is Inexhaustible and Eternal; thus, It cannot be killed in any situation [in any way]. All of these expressions of phenomena – such as Bhishma, Drona etc. - that are bringing forth attachment and delusion in your mind – at their foundations they are all impermanent. Because all of these have come, that means they will go as well, for sure. It is absolutely certain that they will be disintegrated through the power of finite-ness. But that Consciousness-Substance that is the foundation of all of these expressions of phenomena, That has no finite-ness, no disintegration or destruction. Therefore, That has no divisions of time such as past, future etc. That is Eternally Present. Therefore, do not let go of the Eternally Present and grieve over this impermanent body which is just phenomena. This grief is unbecoming of you."
31,"And more, even after perceiving “svadharma” [one's true dharma], it is not appropriate for you to be shaken. This is because there is no greater thing for Kshatriyas [warrior or royal caste] to do than to fight for righteousness.","“Svadharma” [one's true dharma] = the dharma of the Self. The abode/field of the Self is above — Begin Footnote. — “Yo buddhe paratastu sah” [that which is beyond the intellect] – Chapter 3, sloka 42 [of the Gita]. “Manasastu parA buddhirbuddherAtmA” [beyond the mind is the intellect; above that is the Self] – shrutih [Katha Upanishad or Kathopanishad]. — End Footnote. — the abode/field of the intellect. When one comes to this field [of the Self] (in the path of “anuloma” [see sloka 16 of this Chapter 2]), because of the presence of the Pure Ahamkar – filled with a tenderly luminous Light like clusters of lightning, [a knowing, like:] “I am all,” “I am 'I'” - this kind of settled and steady, unified experience and state of “I-ness” comes. This is the true “svadharma” - the state filled with the Absolutely Pure Substance. Dear sadhak! You, upon piercing the Light within the Sound in the Sahasrar via the Kriyayoga received from guru's teachings, dissolving the mind, and becoming one with Vishnu-ness – you have directly experienced and realized that “svadharma.” After knowing that, being shaken like this is no longer appropriate. You are a Kshatriya, engaged in the establishment of the Kingdom of the Self and of that dharma of the Self. Your recourse is verily in rajoguna. Therefore, the splendrous actions of rajoguna, the engagement of warfare with energy/fire – that is your “svadharma.” Now, that dharma of the Self, which is: taking the support of serenity, self-control etc., together with the splendrous energy-fire etc. of your “svadharma,” and for the purpose of destroying the “me” (“the body is me” - destroying this vain and egoistic perception), conducting warfare (pranayam) – there is no second thing that is greater for you to do than this."
32,"O Partha [Arjuna]! “Sukhi” [happy] are the Kshatriyas to have such a war, which has appeared on its own, unsought, and which is like a door to heaven.","“Sukha”: “su” = beautiful; “shubha” [beneficent]; “kha” = “shunya” [void; emptiness]. Earth, water, fire, air, ether – these are the five “somethings.” Whatever has a beginning, end and middle – that is a “something.” The non-existence of this/these “something/s” is “shunya” [void] – meaning: no-thing[s]. The fulfillment of lack – meaning: obtaining the thing to be obtained, or the fulfilling of want, is “shubha” [beneficent]. Whatever want there is – that is only because of the need to have peace. The unbroken, non-tri-guna state is Peace. Because all of the “matrasparsha” ([see] Chapter 2, sloka 14) are endowed with the attributes of arising and ending, and because they are impermanent, they cannot give peace. But because the Self is Eternal, simply by leaving the worldly experiences and coming to It, one receives Peaceful Bliss. This Peaceful state, devoid of worldly experiences, is verily “sukha” [happiness]. The one who enjoys this “sukha” - it is only that person that is “sukhi” [one who is happy]. The one who is a Kshatriya – meaning: the one who is valiant in protecting the revelation of the Light of the Self, and “sukhi” [as well] – it is only that person who has the opportunity for such a war. This is because it has come about without any effort. The happy sadhak, endowed with the Kshatriya-vritti [righteous warrior aspect], can see through the inner vision that the vrittis [active tendencies] of mind are automatically ([meaning:] even without trying) running about with all kinds of worldly ways and are trying to divert the sadhak from the Self-Substance. And more, it is like a door to heaven – meaning: the open door to the Path of the Self. This is because: the sadhak that has gone up to a high level – it is only that sadhak that knows that if the “I am the body idea” – destroying subtle prana is driven correctly, that through a blossomed, jewel-filled (like the light of diamond in water) opening, or perforation, the Light of the Self is bursting through like “kotisurya prateekashaṃ chandrakoti susheetalaṃ” [like millions of suns with the beautiful tranquility of millions of moons]; this can be seen. That is why the Lord is saying, “O Partha! It is by great fortune that one gets the opportunity for this kind of war (Kriya).”"
33,"If you do not fight in this dharma-war right now, then you will incur sin because of having abandoned “svadharma” [one's true dharma] and “keerti” [work that is noble and great].","As soon as that state of happiness comes about for the sadhak, he/she sees the Pure Consciousness Sri Krishna Paramatman in front of him/her. And because of the sadhak's Kshatriya-vritti being there, he/she is directly aware of all of the functions of pravritti and nivritti. That is why it is being said, “Being a happy Kshatriya, if you do not fight this Atman-dharma-oriented, pravritti-destroying war (sadhana with pranayam etc.), then abandoning “svadharma” (the settledness in Brahman) and “keerti” (upon making the effort to attain that settledness in Brahman through the performance of spiritual practice, as the “siddhis” [yogic powers] are attained one after the other, the Light of the Self that comes after that – meaning: the Pure Praise and Belief that comes for oneself because of one's own capability – that) will cause you to fall into sin – meaning: the restlessness of Prakriti – the torrent of birth and death."
34,"And more, all of the phenomena will announce your indelible/undying “akeerti” [lack of accomplishment; failure]. For a capable person, “akeerti” is worse than even death.","Dear sadhak! If, after progressing this far in Kriya, you now abandon the Kriya of pranayam etc. (war) because of falling under the power of sorrow, then – the task that you leave unfinished, and [the knowledge] that you were not able to realize the work you started to do – that will be your “akeerti” [lack of accomplishment; failure]. It is not just that this “akeerti” will cause regret in you only in this life; it will become unending and indestructible. This is because: all of the phenomena (the subtle body composed of the non-quintuplicated five primal elements – the seventeen “kalaa” [functionalities] such as mind etc.) will announce that “akeerti” of yours and make it unending – meaning: because of the extreme downfall after having accomplished greatly, they [the phenomena] will make you succumb to the power of the torrent of births and deaths, again and again, and will not allow you to escape the grip of the memory-samskara of that previously performed act [the reluctance to fight in the dharma-war]. Then – like the way suffering samsaris [worldly people] say, “Oh how many sinful acts I must have done! How many cows I must have murdered! How many people I must have murdered! How many women I must have murdered! Now I am suffering the consequences of all of that!” – because of being under the “grace” of intense samsara, all of those kinds of words will come out of your mouth. This is the “announcing [of your failure].” And then, those [regrets] will transform into [further] samskaras and they will be thorns in the way of the spiritual progress you deeply desire. That is why I am saying – dear sadhak! You are “sambhavita” (greatly revered) – meaning: greater than the seventeen “kalaas” such as mind, intellect etc. If you willingly make the choice to take up this “akeerti,” then this will be even worse than death for you. This is because in death, only the samskaras remain after becoming disembodied, the physical sufferings do not remain; they finish with the body. But in this [“akeerti”], one has to suffer twice the amount of suffering in the body/ies.  "
35,The great warriors will think of you as a person who has become a coward in war. Those who think of you as the greatest – you will become small in their perception.,"When someone is a failure, it is not just that the competent people from the outside that show disrespect or disdain; the primary vrittis of pravritti and nivritti (“the great warriors”) that are within oneself also come up in the mind and bring about reproach in oneself. Then one thinks, “Alas! Alas! Out of fear I withdrew (went backwards)! I could not accomplish the work! Shame on me!” In this way, the self-confident power that was previously there over the vrittis [becomes diminished]; later, because of the vrittis now becoming the rulers, one becomes reduced [in self-confidence] a bit. One cannot summon up in the mind the same kind of mental strength as before. Dear sadhak! Compare all of this to all of your experiences and see if [what is said here] matches. It will all match up."
36,Your enemies will ridicule your capabilities and say so many unspeakable things. What can be a greater suffering than this?,"The maleficent ones – meaning: “shatru” [enemies] — Begin Footnote. — “Shatru” [enemy] – see the commentary of the 8th sloka of Chapter 2 [of the Gita].  — End Footnote. — (deceivers and the senses) – will ridicule your capabilities. They will say all sorts of unspeakable and malevolent things – meaning: you yourself will be greatly ridiculing yourself and being filled with self-contempt, automatically. What can be a greater suffering than this?! “Dhik jeevitaṃ vyarthamanorathasya” - meaning: one who fails at his/her objective, that person's life is contemptuous."
37,"O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! If you get killed, you will be able to go to heaven. If you are victorious, you will be able to enjoy the world. Therefore, “uttiShTha” [stand up]! [see spiritual meaning in the commentary below] and be resolved to fight. ","If you die while continuously being engaged in this sadhana-war, you will attain heaven (the destiny of the Self). This is why: if one leaves the body while continuously doing the work of Sat [Truth], only the Substances of Sat will come at the time of death. Thus, the destiny will be according to Sat (see Chapter 6, slokas 40-46). And if you are victorious, then: “maheeṃ bhokshyase” - meaning: you will enjoy the kingdom of wonders/miracles without any enemies (see the 8th sloka [of this Chapter 2]) – meaning: you will be “jivanmukta” [Liberated while still living in this body]. Therefore, be resolved to fight the war and be established up above (“ut-tiShTha” [established above]) (see the 3rd sloka [of this Chapter 2])."
38,"Know “sukha” and “duhkha” [pleasure and pain, respectively], “labh” and “alabh” [gain and loss, respectively], and “jaya” and “parajaya” [victory and defeat, respectively] to be the same, and engage (present yourself) in the cause of this war. In this way (if you fight) you shall not incur sin.","“Sukha” [happiness; pleasure] has been explained in the commentary of the 32nd sloka [of this Chapter 2]. “Duhkha” [pain; sorrow]: “duh” = darkness/dirty/defiled; “kha” = space; the presence of “vasana” [deeply rooted desire] itself causes the inner space to be covered up with the “veiling-power.” Then an empty, lack-filled, darkness-filled state comes about. That beautiful Light of the Self – even a single ray of it cannot be seen. There is a kind of gasping in the pranas; the mind feels hopeless. That is “duhkha.” Making pleasure and pain, gain and loss, and victory and defeat the same – meaning: being unperturbed in distress and detached in happiness – like: “I am fighting such [a battle] for the sake of fighting (because guru said so)” – in this way, leaving behind the desire for outcomes, take up fighting in the war dutifully – meaning: take up the task to end pravritti-ways. If you do this, sin (restlessness – that which makes the sadhak lose his/her unmoving position and aim) cannot touch you – meaning: no matter if you are in “karma,” “akarma” or “vikarma” [see definitions in the Introduction, Part 4, definitions number 1], you will get the Endless Settledness in Brahman."
39,"O Partha [Arjuna]! This knowledge according to [the path called] “Sankhya” is being spoken to you. Now, listen as I speak about the matters of this knowledge according to [the path called] “Yoga,” the knowledge by which, if you become engaged in it, you will be able to be free of the bindings of karma.","Dear sadhak! This method of insight to bring about certainty [in you] that was just taught you – this is verily the path of “Sankhya.” But how that method-knowledge happens in “Yoga” – now listen to that, by which, if you become engaged in it, you will be able to be completely free of the bindings of karma.
 
What is “sankhya” [as in the spiritual meaning of the word, not only specific to the name of the path]? The ascertaining of knowledge of things through analysis is called “sankhya.” In this, the twenty-four substances of Prakriti, and the one Purush – through the “accounting” [sankhya] of these, there is the ascertaining of the essential knowledge/science of the universe. This knowledge is ascertained through a combination of “anuman[a]” [inference] and “anubhav[a]” — Begin Footnote. — “Anu” [atomic] = subtle, “bhava” = to be – becoming the same as the object of perception/knowledge. — End Footnote. — [ordinary meaning: experience; see footnote for spiritual meaning]. This is why the word “sankhya” means “knowledge.” It is like: dissolving the earth element and blending it with the water element and making them “one” is “yoga,” blending water into fire in the same way is [also] “yoga.” Similarly, fire into air, air into space, space into the tanmatras [the source of the senses], tanmatras into the mind, the mind into the intellect, the intellect into the ahamkar [the “I” sense], the ahamkar into the mahattattva [primal element] or the chitta [personal consciousness/heart], the chitta into the Avyakta [the Inexpressible] or the Mula Prakriti [the Original Prakriti], and finally, merging Prakriti into Purush is called “yoga.” But all of the yogas before the last one are nothing but steps to the last yoga. That is why that gradual progression is called “yoga marga/Yoga Marga” [the path of yoga/the path to Yoga], and the final ending of the progression is called “Yoga” [Union]. It is only after he has attainment of this “Yoga” that the sadhak is a “yogi.” And when in the lower stages, [the sadhak] is a “yogabhyasi” [yogic practitioner; practitioner of the path/method of yoga]. Upon having become a yogi, the knowledge that happens if one leaves that [state of “yogi”] and comes down to the lower stages – that is also “sankhya” [ascertaining after coming down]. Therefore, before yoga there is “sankhya” [ascertaining]; after [yoga] it is also “sankhya” [knowing]; the root of yoga is “sankhya” [instruction and inference], and the fruit is also “sankhya” [realization/Liberation]. The “root” [of yoga] that is being spoken about – that is the knowledge that is gained totally by inference. Alternatively, it is instructional knowledge [from guru]. Thus is “Sankhyayoga” [the yoga of ascertaining]. The “fruit” that is being spoken about – that “fruit” is the Knowledge brought about by the practice of yoga - “Mokshayoga” [the yoga of Liberation]. That is the only difference. Otherwise, it is the same thing. All of the things that have been presented in slokas 24 and 25 – those are verily the “understandings according to the way of Sankhya” or knowledge [according to the way of Sankhya]. In this, every aspect of reality from the earth element to the Self goes on being known. But the knowledge that comes from Yoga, because all of the lower stages become merged [into the Uppermost Stage], all of the knowledge from below are completely finished off, and they gradually transform into One at the Top. This buddhi [in this case: consciousness] that faces towards the Self, when one withdraws oneself inward from the worldly experiences, when one becomes United via this buddhi (this can only happen via pranayam alone; its method is learned from the teachings of guru), “prarabdha” [birth karmas], “sanchit” [accumulated karmas] – whatever the bindings of karma there may be – all of them disappear, permanently and completely."
40,"There is never any loss of “abhikrama” [progress] from the effort made in this karmayoga (no fruitlessness in endeavoring in it), nor is there any going backwards. Even a little bit of this dharma (if practiced) saves one from the Great Fear. ","In this karmayoga, there is never any stopping of “abhikrama” [progress] (“abhi” = front; “krama” = to move) – meaning: there is no stopping of the movement in the direction of the Self. That is because this is a “tadarthiya” karma [act taken in order to attain the predetermined end – Liberation], and because of that there is no “abhav” [loss] in it. Similarly, there is no transgressing or backwards movement [in this yoga] either. That is because the yogi, even in the afterlife, automatically and irrespective of his/her own will, rises up in the direction of the Self because of the power attained through previous practice, as it is stated in sloka 44 of Chapter 6 [of the Gita]. Even a little bit of this dharma (the taking up of yoga) saves one from the Great Fear. The birth and death [and rebirth] is what is called the Great Fear. In the path of pravritti (viloma [see commentary on sloka 16 of this Chapter 2] or the path of samsara) – if one is simply on that path, it means that the attention will be on worldly things. But because of the impermanence of worldly things, it is unavoidable that one has to leave that worldly experience after the end of the period of enjoyment of whatever that worldly thing is. Therefore, death is a certainty. And just because there is death, there is again rebirth. This birth and death cycle goes on repeating. It does not end. But if one progresses even a little in the path of nivritti (anuloma [see commentary on sloka 16 of this Chapter 2] or the path of yoga), because of the absence of non-progress or transgression, the attention becomes magnetized to the Eternal. Thus, whether by breath or by body [see commentary on slokas 26 and 27 of this Chapter 2 regarding the two types of death], whatever kind of death that happens, after just a few births one can go beyond the birth-death torrent. “BahunAṃ janmanAmante jnAnvAn maṃ prapadyate” [after many births, those with Divine Knowledge attain/come unto Me] (Gita 7:19)."
41,"O Kurunandan [Arjuna]! In this karmayoga, the intellect becomes “vyavasayatmika” (full of conviction), and “eka” [one and only/singular]. But the intellects of the “avyavasayis” [ones with wrong conviction] become multi-branched and endless [endlessly bound].","In this karmayoga, the intellect becomes “vyavasatmika” (“vy” = space eye + “av” = spreading + “so” = death) – meaning: upon being spread out in the space filled [inner] eye, and thereby becoming Still, one becomes filled with Stillness and Absolute Certainty; and [the intellect] becomes “eka” [one and only/singular] – meaning: being firmly established in the Star in the center of Kutastha – with Light like millions of suns and the beautiful tranquility of millions of moons, one becomes the Bliss of the One, or filled with the Bliss of Brahman. But those who are “avyavasayi” (“a” = prefix of negation + “vy” = particular + “ava” = certainty + “so” = “udyoga” [endeavoring]) – meaning: those who, through particular convictions - “udyoga” (“ut” = in the path of Brahman; “yoga” = those who do not do the practice of the Kriya of pranayam etc. [the total meaning of “udyoga” in only this particular context is given here]) - their buddhi-vrittis (intellect) leave the oneness and fall to “many-ness,” becoming multi-branched – meaning: coming into contact with many different types of worldly things, [the intellect] takes on many different forms. And it is endless – meaning: being locked-up in the partaking of worldly things, the [variations of the intellect] continue to grow endlessly because of the tumult of the repeated births and deaths. One is not able to leave the worldly consciousness, not able to come to Brahman and cannot attain the Radiant Fountain of Bliss. One does not get the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana [Emancipation]."
"42,43,44","O Partha [Arjuna]! All of those “avipashchit” [ignorant ones] – undiscriminating, desirous souls, bound to the [desires] for heavenly pleasures who are engaged in the rites as stated in the Vedas, taking up the conviction of “there is nothing else [other than heaven as the highest]” - all of these enchanting things that they say in the performance of the many rites in order to obtain riches for enjoyment – because their hearts are stolen away [by such words] and because of their becoming addicted to the enjoyment of riches, their intellects cannot have stability in samadhi.","“Vipashchit” [wise] (“vi” + “pra” = viprakrishta [remote] + “cha” = to gather + “ka”): one who gathers together “viprakrishta” - meaning: things that are “duravarta” [at a far distance or long way off]. How many kinds of “dur” [distances] are there? Space-related, time-related, and attainment/objective-related – these are the three types of distances. The space-related things that are far away can be gathered in (completely had) by the hands and feet [etc.] - meaning: via physical actions. The time-related things that are far away can be collected through logical inferences of past and future [and such] and through analysis – meaning: through the actions of the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness]. And the attainment/objective-related things that are far away can be collected in (completely had) by “anubhava” - meaning: that can be had by becoming more and more “anu” [atomic], after passing the chitta-dharma – meaning: after the dissolving of everything in the practice of Layayoga [the yoga of dissolution], where the vrittis of the antahkarana are dissolved and the self merges into the Self. The one who takes these three – body, mind and soul – and makes them one, and is thereby able to obtain the “far away” [objective of] “Naad-Bindu” (existing beyond the six chakras) completely – meaning: he/she can merge into that or can try to merge into that – that person is “vipashchit” [wise]. But one who does not obtain that far away objective via Kriyayoga, or does not try to obtain it, and goes on collecting the “nearby things” instead – meaning: the visible worldly things within the five chakras – that person is “avipashchit” [ignorant]. Thus, the desire-bound person is “avipashchit” - meaning: undiscriminating. The undiscriminating ones, bound by the power of wanting, aim for heaven – the highest level of sense-pleasure-enjoyment. The highest fruit of desire-fulfilling rites is heaven. In the “karmakanda” [section on rites] of the Vedas, this is the proviso that has been given. Those people [the “avipashchit”] take up that stated provision in the Vedas and say, “Attaining heaven is the highest fruit; there is nothing besides that”; they say all kinds of nicely put together, enchanting things. Doing such things results in this: they lose their sensibilities, become ignorant of the differences between the Eternal and the temporal, and go on being ever-engrossed in enjoyments and opulence. They are not able to have consciousness stabilized in union in samadhi. Why they cannot – that matter will be clearly stated [in the next paragraph].
 
Karma [action] is of two types - “sakama” [with desire] and “nishkama” [without desire]. These happen externally via the physical body and internally via the subtle body. Because of this, there is a limit in the carrying out of action. Just as, in the external, the body becomes tired and unable to move after excessive labor and no more work can be done, one has to stop trying – in the same way, in the internal, when action reaches a very intense state, it ends and a state of stillness comes about. That state of stillness is called “samadhi.” Thus, this samadhi is the inevitable result of Kriya. But because of the desirous and desirelessness versions of action [see first sentence of this paragraph], samadhi is of two types. When one becomes “extinguished” in desirous action, one has to carry on the memory-samskaras of the desired things through [and after] the extinguishing. Right after samadhi breaks [finishes] – that memory awakens again immediately upon returning to the waking state. This is called, “jada-samadhi” [samadhi of the body]. In this, glorious experiences and revelations are had, [but] there is absolutely no Liberation. [On the other hand,] when desireless actions end, because of the absence of desire, only Consciousness/Spirit remains the focus, and one becomes merged in that Consciousness/Spirit Itself. When this state [of samadhi] goes away, nothing is thought about in the mind. There is a kind of “I don't know what but I was in quite a wonderful way” experience where the antahkarana remains intoxicated in a Bliss-Nectar. This is called “Chaitanya-Samadhi” [Samadhi of Spirit] or “Brahmisthiti” [abidance in the Supreme]. Right before this “Chaitanya-Samadhi,” the intellect becomes “vyavasayatmika” [stable; certain]. That is why it is written that even if the addicted [to samsara] attain samadhi, their intellects do not become stable in it.
"
45,"O Arjuna, all Veda/s [alternative meaning: ascertainable knowledge] is/are about the matters connected to the three gunas [energetic qualities in all things and acts]. Therefore, by being without doubt, abiding always in truth [or: purity], unattached and abiding in the Self, be devoid of the three gunas.","Whatever is known – all are “veda” [ascertainable knowledge]. The Vedas [in this case – the scriptures] are divided into Rik, Yaju, Sama, Atharva – these four sections. These Vedas are actually about the matters of the three gunas [energetic qualities of all things physical and subtle]. “Rajah,” [alternate versions of the word: rajas; rajo; rajoguna] “sattva,” “tamah” [alternate versions of the word: tamas; tamo; tamoguna] – these are the three gunas. The aggregate of these is called “traigunya.” The dharma of rajas – activity; the result – suffering/pain (because one has to labor to simply do work). The dharma of sattva – revelation [or: light; manifestation] (that which happens on its own; the form of self awareness); the result – pleasure. The dharma of tamas – stability (end/destruction/annihilation); the result – delusion. The combined dharma of these three – the union of pleasure, pain and delusion; the result – joy. Just as the power for a seed to sprout does not come about without the combined help of water, air and heat – in the same way, if these three gunas remain separate from each other, they cannot just do their own particular activities and still manifest. It is by the mixing of the three together that each's activities come forth. But if in that combination the proportion of each one is the same, then no activity at all happens. A state of equilibrium comes about. Activities come forth only when the proportions are unequal.
 
At the Muladhar, tamas finishes, sattva begins and there is the full manifestation of rajas. In the Svadhisthan, rajas is 12/16 in proportion, sattva is 4/16 in proportion. At the Manipur, rajas and sattva are in equal proportions. (See Illustration No. 3 [in the Introduction].) Immediately upon crossing past the Manipur, the proportion of rajas becomes progressively and increasingly lower in comparison to the proportion of sattva. Thus, the part that is predominantly rajas-powered is the area between the Muladhar to the Manipur. When one sits to meditate, at first the activity-filled rajas takes over – meaning: one has to forcefully and determinedly drive prana in the environment of the collective causalities of the physical body. For as long as prana does not become subtle and thereby take the mind into the “vajra” [nadi], for that long will the activities of pranas be very strong; the mind will be restless; and at this time Kutastha remains clouded over. Whatever is visible – they are all kind of far, far away, like some things revealed by occasional flashes of lightning – like blurry shadows – these go on appearing in unclear ways – this is what is called “duhkha” [sorrow/pain] (“dure shunya” [nothing far away]). Afterwards, when one enters into the vajra and arrives at the Manipur, even though rajas and sattva are equal in proportion there (in duhkha) – in the middle of a sun-like sphere in the distant sky, a vision of a two-armed red form of Brahmi-Shakti as a girl – with a garland of rudraksha beads [or: with a rosary of rudraksha beads] and a water-pot, and sitting on a swan – is seen. At that time, all around there is a kind of scintillating, resonating atmosphere. If one puts one's hearing in that resonance, one experiences that there is some kind of thing being spoken/recited on the eastern side; — Begin Footnote. — Know that the front side of the body is east, the back side is west, the right side is south and the left side is north. — End Footnote. — it can be heard but nothing much can be discerned very well. It is like a toothless old man saying something very fast – who knows what – in another room on the other side of the wall – this kind of experience is had. Everything that is known/ascertained up to the Manipur in the pain-filled, rajas-powered, activity dominated field – all of that is the Rigveda [also called “Rik Veda,” among other variations] - “A” [the first letter of the Omkar/AUM]. That spoken sound that is heard – that is the Gayatri Mantra, and that goddess [seen in the sun-like sphere] is the presiding deity of the Rigveda - “Gayatri” - the first manifestation of Gayatri.

Upon piercing the Manipur and entering into the “chitra” [nadi], many colorful and wondrous visions can be seen. Piercing through the place of the eight-fold powers (the technique – Kriya – is known through the teachings of guru) and going above – there is the Anahata-chakra. In that Anahata, sattva is 12/16 in proportion; rajah is 4/16; and in the Vishuddha, sattva is 14/16 in proportion; rajah is 2/16. Naturally, because of rajah's intensity becoming softer, the proportion of sorrow is reduced and happiness arises. The inner sky becomes filled with light. The restlessness of mind and the intensity are gone. At this time “upasana” [worshipfulness] (“upa” = near; “asana” = settled place) goes on happening – meaning: because of the mind being so attracted to the various visions from the chitra, the interest in prana-kriya comes to an end, and thus the gap between the seen and seer is reduced and one comes near the place of spiritual awareness. Then, within the twelve-petaled lotus, another eight-petaled lotus blossoms forth. On that, in the middle of a sphere of light, the black, four-armed, three-eyed form of the Vaishnavi-Shakti as a young woman is seen, holding a conch-shell, a discus, a mace and a lotus [in each of the four hands] and seated on the mystical bird Garuda. Right along with the appearance of that vision, the Gayatri mantra can be heard clearly, in a soft and melodious vocalization – nearby on the right side (in the back of the right ear); this can be heard. After that, when that light is pierced via the inner shambhavi [mudra], in the blink of an eye, a sixteen-petaled lotus blossoms forth in the Vishuddha. In that, that same goddess again shows Herself, in an electric-lightning form, and then immediately disappears. Everything that is known in this sattva-powered, “upasana”-predominant, pleasure-filled field of the Anahata-Vishuddha – that is what is known as “Yajurveda” [also known as Yajur Veda, among other variations] - “U” [the second letter of the Omkar/AUM]. That is the goddess who is “Savitri” - the presiding deity of the Yajurveda – the second manifestation of Gayatri. Because She appears in a black form and then later in the electric-lightning-form, the Yajurveda is divided into two sections - “Krishnayajuh” [the dark Yajurveda] and “Shuklayajuh” [the bright Yajurveda].
 
Above the Vishuddha, the rajoguna becomes more and more weak until it reaches it weakest level and then finishes at the Ajna. Sattva is fully manifested at this Ajna, and it is the beginning of tamoguna. (See Illustration No. 3 [in the Introduction].) Amongst the three gunas, it is seen that the tamoguna is primary. This is because: (it can be seen in anuloma [see sloka 16 of this Chapter 2 for clarification of “anuloma”]) it is indeed on top of the completely pure tamoguna that the world-birthing Mahamaya [resides]; it is of course on top of the perfectly still foundation [pure tamas] that activity takes place [rajas]; and indeed, it is on top of the activity that there is revelation/light [sattva]; and again it is in the still foundation [tamas], indeed, that all come to rest.10 Although it [tamas] begins at Ajna, — Begin Footnote. — All three gunas are present everywhere; however, predominance can be seen to happen in twos. Where there is the predominance of rajas-tamah, there sattva, being covered up, is in an almost absent state. Where there is the predominance of rajah-sattva, there tamoguna is almost absent. And where there is the predominance of sattva-tamah, there the rajoguna is almost absent. — End Footnote. — it is present and spread everywhere in different proportions. It is that very presence [of tamas], becoming more and more substantial in the upwards direction, that becomes transformed into its own pure form at the Ajna. Here, a group of extraordinarily beautiful events is seen to be happening together. Within the light of pure sattva, [one experiences:] above and below – there are tamas and rajas, respectively, mixing together in their very subtle forms [with sattva] – here there is the coming together of stillness and activity at the same time. From the “mouth” of the conjunction of rajas-tamas area, there is the rising up of waves of musical sound playing according to the rules of “ragas” and “raginis” [melodic forms]; Pranava-Gayatri is sounding resonance after resonance; the Vedas and the sayings of the rishis [ancient sages] are being recited on the west side – all in very clear and wonderfully comely tones; gods, gandharvas [celestial beings], sages, spirits, demons, celestial musicians, planets, deities etc. - as if the entire Cosmos is acting out according to prescribed roles on a grand theater stage – the appearance of creation, preservation, destruction – the mind and heart are entranced, restlessness has disappeared – in short: “ihaikesthaṃ jagat kṛtsnaṃ sacharacharaṃ prakatita (“murtiman” [visible/manifested])” [the entire universe with all things moving and unmoving – visible/manifested here]. Whatever is known in this music-predominant, tamas-ruled place, the not delusional but spiritual trance-filled field of Ajna – all of that is verily Samaveda [also known as Sama Veda, among other variations] - “M” [the third letter of the Omkar/AUM]. When the attention is perfect in the bindu in the conjunction of the rajas-tamah, a supremely tenderly radiant, white two-armed form, with a trident, a damaru [hand drum], riding on a bull – the Raudri-Shakti as an old woman is seen. It is She who is the presiding deity of the Samaveda, the goddess “Sarasvati” - the third manifestation of Gayatri.

Within the sattva inside the Ajna, the place of conjunction of rajas and tamas is called “Kuta.” Within that Kuta, an incomparably beautiful and luminous bindu is seen. That is the Beginningless Maheshvara [Lord of the universe; Shiva]. From there, Sarasvati rises. From the mouth of Maheshvara, the ceaseless recitation of mantras from Vedas and such, with waves of particularly intoned sounds, is going on. It is from these mantras and such that the Mother of the Vedas, the Ajna to Muladhar pervading, Gayatri-Savitri-Sarasvati-Form – is appearing everywhere, resonating in activity via the rajoguna, and residing in the light-filled “grand sattva.” This is why She is [called]: “maheshvaravadanotpannA viShNohṛdayasambhavA brahmaNA samanujnAtA” [arising from the speech of Maheshvara, residing in the heart of Vishnu, and dear to Brahmaa [the creator aspect of the Godhead Trinity]]. In the functions and activities within the region spanning from the Ajna to the Muladhar, She manifests in three Forms, and is invoked in the bunching together of three verses in the “tripaad” [three-versed] mantra. That is why She is called “Tripada.” She has yet another verse. That fourth verse resides in the non-doing Sahasrar. The “Gayatri Mantra” that is learned during the thread ceremony of the brahmins – that is three-versed. The mantra that is taught/learned when taking sannyas [formal renunciation] – that is the fourth verse of Gayatri. Only the sannyasi [renunciate] has the right to the fourth verse, not those still attached to actions. This is because She cannot be known unless one pierces the Kutastha and arrives at the Sahasrar.
 
Right after crossing the Ajna after piercing Kutastha, rajoguna is finished and its influence is also ended gradually. Prana-kriya ends. The non-doing Sahasrar is revealed. Then the Tranquil, Revelatory Light of Knowledge shines forth. In that Light, the matters and happenings of past, future and present are seen and known. At this time, the Mother of the universe, the three-eyed Adya-Shakti, sometimes in the form of Purush and sometimes in the form of Prakriti, becomes pleased, and She tears apart the sadhak's delusional, duality-filled net of Maya, and bestows the Insight-Knowledge. The recitation of the Gayatri, now with the fourth verse as well, comes forth. (This can be heard on the north side.) From that fourth verse, sannyas [renunciation] comes into being – meaning: all of the celestial sounds finish completely into the one Pranava and a waveless, single-toned (non-fluctuating) unstruck Sound comes forth. From within this Sound, a Luminous Bindu blossoms forth. That is verily Taraka-Brahman. He has no limits at all. The mind becomes locked in Him. In this state, the vrittis of the senses become devoid of activity – meaning: the matters of the senses are there; the senses are there; yet there is no partaking – this type of state comes into being. At that time, spontaneously, one becomes nothing but a viewing witness to the matters of the universe, and one becomes completely imbued with the Eternal Bliss of Truth. This Bliss-filled state of Knowledge is the Atharvaveda [also known as Atharva Veda, among other variations] - “OM.” From the center of that Bindu, a Brilliantly Radiant Form appears. It is He Who is the Supreme Shiva, Narayana – the Niranjan Purush Who is beyond all fields.
 
All of these things that are directly known in the field spanning the Muladhar to the Sahasrar, that which is called “veda” [knowledge] – they are nothing but the work of the three gunas using the spreading power of inner sound. For as long as there is mind, for that long is the experience of the seen and the seer. All of this is the work of Maya; thus they are endowed with limitedness. For this reason, Sri Bhagavan [Sri Krishna] is saying, “O Arjuna! Be devoid of the three gunas” - meaning: that which happens when one becomes merged, after the mind gets locked in that Taraka-Brahman-Niranjan-Purush – become That Itself. That Merged State is verily the state of being devoid of the three gunas – Vishnu's Supreme State. [The Lord] is speaking about the signs during progress towards being devoid of the three gunas: 1) “atmavan” - abiding at the field of the Self; when there is no awareness of anything at all other than the worshipper “I” and the worshipped “I” - the state of non-doing; 2) “niryogakshema” - after that [“atmavan”] state comes, “yoga” - meaning: the thing to get – there is none of that left; “kshema” - meaning: there is not even the keeping of the received thing; past and future disappear and only the present remains; 3) “nityasatvasthah” - the brahmanadi that is within the sushumna, the space in its middle is called “nityasatva” [always pure]; this is beyond the fields and is the eternal place beyond the fields; it is in this place that – upon making the receiver and that which is to be received as one – the Niranjan-Purush shows Himself; 4) “nirdvandva” – upon arriving at the “nityasatva,” cold and heat, pleasure and pain, me and mine, I and you and such twoness ends and the mind is dissolved. This is that which is called the “State of Vishnu beyond the three gunas.”"
46,"As much as there is the need for an “udapana” (place holding a small amount of water) when a flood has covered everything completely with water, the brahmin with the Knowledge of Brahman has that much need of all of the Vedas (the Vedic rites).","When the water of a deluge floods the entire land, the water from ponds, wells, swamps, rivers and such “udapana” (pits holding water) merge with the water of the flood, and all water becomes one big water. There is no more difference in their names and forms, and because their pits are under the floodwater and cannot be seen, they also do not have any separate existence on the outside. At that time, whatever the necessities of water there may be, all are met by that one mass of water. But because the depth is not the same in every area of the floodwater, if there is the need to access deep water to carry out a particular task, one has to go to places where the pits of those ponds, wells, rivers are present, and use the pit at that place. It is like when an enormous thing has to be submerged, or if a big boat or a ship has to be floated, such things have to be submerged or floated in a place where there is a [deep] hole or where the pit or cavern is deep. Like the “artha” [function – see beginning of sloka for “yavanartha”] (usefulness) that is there for those watering holes or waterways at the time of the flood – just like that is the usefulness of Vedic rites for the “vijanata” [knowing] brahmin. The one who gets to know the All-Knowing via sadhana – meaning: the one who becomes knowledgeable about Vedas in the path of yoga, and goes to the final place of the knowable at the State of Vishnu-ness – it is only that person who is the Brahman-based, master of jnana and vijnana, possessor of the eight siddhis - “vijnata brahmin.” It is only that sadhak who is “nishkama” [without desire]. That person has no desire or need of anything for him/herself – at all. That person ever abides in Completeness in the Bliss of Brahman, and only carries out the journey of the body because of prarabdha karma [karma determining the body's lifespan], and nothing more. That person is devoid of the three gunas. And because of knowing Brahman, he/she is “Brahman-knower” or “knower of all.” That all-knowing person's Knowledge covers up the knowledge of the Vedic rites, and thereby the knowledge of the Vedic rites go into that sadhak's Total Knowledge and become one. Those [Vedic knowledge] have no more separate existence; therefore, no separate use for them remains either. But for the benefit of the “traigunya” [that which is of the three gunas] or the “world,” many times these [realized] persons have to take part in the traigunya concerns. But, even though they are able to accomplish every task/act with their own power, they do not always use that power. This is because: if that power is used there is a chance of being bound to karma! For that reason, in order to teach people, they take the help of brahmins who have the authority to perform rites, and carry out the Vedic rites according to the injunctions in the scriptures, awakening the powers of mantras – only so that there is success and help for people in the society and people who are in need, or for the sake of disciples."
47,It is to the act that you have the right; may there not be any [right] to the outcome/s. Do not be the cause of the results of actions. And may you not be addicted to “akarma” [non-acting; or: wrong act [see commentary below for multiple definitions according to spiritual progress]].,"Only Consciousness/Spirit can be spoken of as “I”. Otherwise, everything else is spoken of as “you.” For as long as the sadhak does not pierce Kutastha and attain Stillness, for that long does his/her pranic activity go on in that which is spoken of as “you” (“te” [see second line of sloka 47 above]) – meaning: prana goes on traveling from chakra to chakra. Thus, the sadhak [at that time] has the “right” - meaning: capability – over actions. But actions have fruits just by being actions. Just as in chemistry, different substances mix together and a new energetic property comes about through chemical interaction – in the same way, the mixing of mind and prana with the letter-formed “matrikas” [energetic properties] in the petals of the lotuses within the sushumna brings forth many types of miracles or powers. Those powers come to the sadhak as places of recourse [for him/her to take]. If the sadhak claims a right (holds) to those powers, then he/she becomes locked-up in “bhoga” [non-spiritual indulgence] and cannot progress any more. That is why the Lord is saying, “Do not ever claim a right to the outcomes of actions.” Not only that: “Do not be the cause of the results of actions” - meaning: that which brings about the results of actions, do not do that. When offering prana to every lotus [in the sushumna], if the connectedness moves from the vital-force and falls to the petals, then, because of that connection [to the petals], desire arises and brings about fruits. But if at that time the connectedness does not leave the prana, then there cannot be any rising up of desire. In [that type of] prana-offering [to the chakras], powers are only awakened [but] they do not rise up. Being “parsparaṃ bhAvayanta” [everything cooperating with one another], one attains “paraṃ shreyo” [the greatest] (see the commentary on the 11th sloka of Chapter 3 [of the Gita]). One does not have to be the cause of the fruits of actions. And He says even more, “Do not be associated with 'akarma' [non-acting; or: wrong act].” Moving prana within the brahmanadi from the Muladhar to the Ajna is verily “the act.” Before this act, there is “akarma,” and after it, there also “akarma.” Before this “act,” all of the works – except for the “tadarthiya” [spiritual] work – that are being carried out by the physical senses – all of that is “akarma” [wrong acts] – meaning: forbidden acts. Similarly, the action-less state that comes about after crossing the Ajna, when all acting is finished – that is also “akarma” [non-acting] – meaning: the state of non-doing. The first “akarma” is in the field of rajas-tamah; the second “akarma” takes place in the sattva-tamah field. If one becomes attached to the first “akarma,” one has to fall into an endless mire [of samsara]. If one becomes attached to the second “akarma” - meaning: doing Kriya with the desire to attain the state of non-doing, then “kashmal” comes to Kutastha [confused visions [see the commentary on sloka 2 of this Chapter 2]]. Thus, not being able to pierce that, one has to remain below. This is why, one has to perform the act (Kriya) without any associations – meaning: without attachment/addiction, and only thinking of it as dutiful work. Non-attachment/non-addiction brings about the peeling off; attachment-addiction keeps one sealed in. (See the next sloka.)"
48,"O Dhananjaya [Arjuna]! Being “yogastha” (established in the place of yoga) and knowing attainment and non-attainment as one and the same, act without having any associations. To “make one” is that which is called “yoga.”","The place where action and non-action come together is called “yogasthan” [place of yoga]. This place is the Kuta in the Ajna. When attention becomes still at the Kuta, one is able to be “yogastha” [established in the place of yoga]. Upon continuously moving prana in the canal of the sushumna according to the instructions of guru, at the end the support-less non-doing state comes about spontaneously. That is the attainment of action. Not having that happen is non-attainment. “Whether attainment happens or not, I have the right to act. Let me do the act.” Taking up action with determination and this kind of unattached feeling is what makes attainment and non-attainment one and the same (this state is known by oneself in sadhana). And, without touching anything on the sides, only offering prana in the brahmanadi according to the instructions of guru – when this is done, one casts off associations. Keeping attention steady at Kutastha and not giving mind to result or non-result, and only abiding in the Sky of Brahman, a state of oneness comes about – meaning: the breath goes into equilibrium and, becoming more and more subtle, becomes still. As well, the mind goes past the Kuta and immerses itself in the “Bindu Sarovar” [Bindu Lake]. No awareness (conception) of anything else remains. This state of oneness is, verily, that which is called “yoga.”"
49,"O Dhananjaya [Arjuna]! Because action without “buddhiyoga” [with engaged intellect] is very low/inferior, take recourse in the intellect. Those who crave outcomes are misers.","If one takes up some task in the world without putting one's mind into it (without “manoyoga” [engagement of mind]), just as that work does not get carried out in a proper way – in sadhana it is the same; if the act is performed without the intellect (without “buddhiyoga” [engagement of intellect]), that work (Kriya) does not at all take hold – meaning: there is no leaving the external orientation and having internal orientation. There is no leaving the worldly experience and diving into Brahman. The function/work of the intellect is “vichara” [enquiry/analysis] – meaning: this is not the Self, that is not the Self, those are not the Self – continually casting off everything in this way, and gradually becoming steady in attention on the Self. If the intellect does come to that kind of steadiness during the act, the company of the worldly experiences is not left behind. Thus in this case, according to the rules of “sangAt sanjAyate kAmah” [desires exist according to the company one keeps] and such, the intellect gets destroyed, and one has to fall. Therefore, without buddhiyoga [engagement of the intellect], the true fruit of the act cannot be brought out by only performing the act alone. For this reason it [the act] is low/inferior."
50,"If one becomes united with Brahman through the intellect, both good and bad works are cast off in this very lifetime. Therefore, take care to practice for this union. Applying special techniques to/in the act is that which is called “yoga.”","When the intellect gets locked in that Bindu, because the awareness of the universe disappears, one becomes Unmoving and Brahman-filled. That is the state that is known as “Chaitanya-Samadhi.” At that time, because there is no partaker of bodily things, all of the prarabdha karmas [karmas bound to this bodily existence], good and bad, because they can no longer find a home in the jiva, are destroyed automatically and spontaneously. And they never sprout again. It is to get this kind of release that one needs to perform yoga. The application of techniques to/in the act is that which is called “yoga.” No one can hold the force of an enormous torrent of water, but with certain techniques, the flows of that torrent can be directed in different directions, guided into different currents, and gradually brought under control. The actions, which are taking place in the form of the torrent of prana that is naturally going on in the body of the jiva – through the use of a special technique, — Begin Footnote. — What this technique is – that cannot be known except from the teachings of guru. “Shishyaste'haṃ shAdhi mAṃ tvAṃ prapannaṃ” [I am your disciple. Guide/correct me. I surrender to you.] – when one says this devotedly in the silent place within, without being disingenuous and without attachment [to the outcome], guru appears in the subtle body and reveals that technique within. No matter how much instruction guru gives in the physical body, if the disciple is not fit [for the instruction], he/she cannot even comprehend it. Only by performing “the act” according to guru's instructions – because the inner veils gradually become evident – the appropriate technique/s to destroy those [veils] become taught/learned spontaneously. Imagination, inference/logic – it is not possible at all to know that by these at all. It cannot be even spoken about properly in words. If one tries to speak about it, [the teaching] remains in the imagination alone, like the stories told in the Upanishads. — End Footnote. — that torrent of prana can be directed in different directions, and making it gradually finer and finer, can be brought under one's control. Later, the state that comes about after offering oblations of that prana into the Fire of the Self – that is what is known, verily, as yoga. "
51,"The people who have their intellect fixed [on the Self], having cast off the fruits from karma, become wise, and they attain, for certain, the disease-free state, emancipated from birth and death – meaning: the state free of the illness of samsara.","If one is with one-pointed intellect in buddhiyoga [the intellect fixed on the Self] and holds on to the bindu, rulership over the mind is born. The mind becomes according to how one would like it to be. That is, verily, the state of the wise. Then as mind stays in Mind, the fruits of karma have no place to exist; they automatically get destroyed. The Prakritic covering being torn off (one no longer has to “float around” in any other kind of veiling – meaning: one does not have to take birth), one attains the state that is free of the disease of birth and death, the Peace-filled state of Vishnu. This is absolutely and totally for certain."
52,"When your intellect goes through the [seemingly] impenetrable fort of delusion, then you will become “nirveda” (devoid of pain) about that which is to be heard and that which has been heard.","When intellect becomes certain/fixed [in the Self], all confusion dissolves; no delusion remains any longer. One no longer has to be deceived by the veils of sound and touch and such [senses]. Then, that which is to be heard — Begin Footnote. — In the path of laya [dissolution], only the Sound remains at the end. No things relating to the passage of time remain at all. That is why time has been spoken about [in sloka 52] using the reference of “shrutijnana” [knowledge of sound]. — End Footnote. — – meaning: the future – and that which has been heard – meaning:  the past – the awareness (pain) of these two no longer remain. Only the present remains – meaning: because of the Sound becoming unbroken, as well as being unstruck, it cannot be found to have any beginning or end. As the torrent [of sense-experience] ends, there is no before and after. Everything becomes the present. Then the current of time comes to an end and the sadhak him/herself becomes transformed into Time itself. Therefore, he/she no longer has any separation of past and future. The sadhak becomes transformed into the Changeless True Substance and becomes the Eternal Present. — Begin Footnote. — Who am I, by what has this “I” or this feeling [of “I”] happened
What is the past “I”, this visible body, what will I be, what my birth was in the past
The word “I” means One, and even more, all is unified
The dual aspect of time, future and past, has been erased by this “I”
 — End Footnote. — When the “I” of the jiva is dissolved into the Great “I”, there is no existence of “two” next to the existence of the One. Therefore, no ascertaining and understanding remain either. A state free of the knowledge of all matters comes into being."
53,"When your intellect becomes ensconced in the Sound, and becomes fixed and immovable and thus becomes established in samadhi – it is then that you will have attained yoga.","When one puts one's mind into the unbroken, unstruck Sound, the consciousness becomes enraptured by that, and stops holding onto the ability to understand, or anything else. It only remains magnetized to that Light that shines forth from the middle of that Sound. In this state, the power of knowingness becomes “shrutivipratipanna” - meaning: continuously listening to the Resonance of Pranava, it becomes centered and “nischala” [fixed] – meaning: it does not travel from one bindu to another bindu. Later, it becomes united with Brahman and becomes “achala” - meaning: still – meaning: no activities of the power of understanding remain. All of the types of vibrations cease. That vibration-ceased state is verily the state of yoga. As it is said in the Uttara Gita (Chapter 1, sloka 4015):
 
“anAhatasya shabdasya tasya shabdasya yo dvanih
dhvanirantargataṃ jyotirjyotirantargataṃ manah
tanmano vilayaṃ yAti tadviShNoh paramaṃ padam”
 
[within the sound that is unstruck, within that sound is the resonance
within that resonance is the light, within the light is the mind
where that mind is dissolved, that is the Supreme Vishnu-state]
"
54,"Arjuna said, “O Keshava [Sri Krishna]! What are the signs of one who has become “sthitaprajna” [steady in consciousness]. What does that “sthitadhi” [spiritually steady] say? How does that person live? How does that person move/go about?","The vibration-free state that comes about in the state of yoga – when one attains that state – even if one comes down from that state, the mind never again becomes attached to the things of the world as before. The consciousness at all times keeps its attention on the Supreme Self whether moving, sitting, eating, laying [etc.]; the world, as well, becomes gradually more and more filled with Brahman; even while in the waking state, the mind experiences that state of samadhi. And because the Light of Knowledge remains still and steady, this state is called “jagrata samadhi” [samadhi while carrying on life in the waking state]. The person who has this “jagrata samadhi” is the person who is “jivanmukta” [Liberated while living in the body]. The signs of this type of person are asked about through four questions in this sloka. Among these four questions, the first one is of small significance; the other three are of greater significance. Starting with answering the first question in sloka 55, these questions are [all] answered in slokas 55-72. Within these, slokas 56 and 57 answer the question “What does that person in “sthitaprajna” say?” “How does that person live?” is answered in slokas 58, 61, 68 to 70. And “how does that person move/go about?” is answered in slokas 71 and 72."
55,"The Lord said, “O Partha [Arjuna]! When the yogi has abandoned all of the deep rooted desires of the mind, and becomes settled and satisfied simply in his/her own self – that is when that person is called “sthitaprajna.”","After enjoying the state of yoga, when the mind comes down [to carry out daily life], it remains in the field of the Self; it no longer descends to the lower levels. As the world is then filled with the Self, one remains as oneself in Oneself. No corrupt desires of worldly enjoyment at all can reach that place. When this state is attained, that is called “sthitaprajna.”"
56,"One whose mind is not distressed in pain/suffering, one who is indifferent in pleasure, one who is devoid of attachment, fear and anger and is a muni [sage] – it is that person who is called “sthitaprajna.”","Samsara – [meaning:] that which is called “pleasure and pain” - that does not remain in that person. This is because: while being in the matters of pleasure and pain in the world, that person does not live in the worldliness; therefore, attachment, fear and anger find no place in him/her. Because of that sadhak's mind being “sangleena” [enjoined to the Self] to the universe-pervading Supreme Self – that sadhak is called “muni” [peaceful sage]. The separated state of mind is jiva. The “sangleena” state [of the mind] is “Ishvara” [God as a separate identity]. And the “praleena” [dissolved in the Self] state is Shiva or Brahman. The “sthitadhi” [spiritually steady] person is in the “Ishvara” condition."
57,"One who is free of affection in all matters, does not become either happy or angry when good or bad comes – that person is “sthitaprajna.”","Because of everything being realized as Brahman, only the “I”-awareness remains for that sadhak; the “mine”-awareness does not remain. Because that sadhak is always in the spiritual state, no lack happens for him/her. Thus, that sadhak has no beneficence and maleficence, no joy and sorrow. "
58,"Just as a tortoise withdraws its head and limbs from the outside into its body, similarly, when the yogi completely gathers in all of the senses from the worldly experience – it is only then that his/her “prajna” [inner awareness] is established. ","Because of being outer-directed, the five senses such as the eyes etc. always experience the matters of the external world. By drawing all of these senses inward from the outer world (like: turning the tongue back, keeping sight above in a still way, aligning the body, head and neck etc.), if one drives their powers [the powers of the senses] in the inner direction through the concentration of mind, there is the experience of extraordinary scent, taste, sight, touch and sound; from these the knowledge of all of the elements is gained. Afterwards, scent goes into taste, taste into sight [etc.] – and like this, all are drawn in and transformed to sound. At that time, the antahkarana [aggregate of the inner operators of personal consciousness] becomes attracted to that sound and unites with the Supreme Self. It is only when this ultimate “drawn-in” state comes about that the “prajna” [inner awareness] is established."
59,"For the embodied person who lives without “ahar” [dining; food], there is only the withdrawal of worldly experiences, [but] the desire to enjoy worldly experiences remains. However, for the sadhak, because of having seen the Supreme (Vishnu-Being), even the desire to enjoy is withdrawn.","Having worldly experiences through the senses is that which is called “ahar” [dining; food]. This “ahar” is not there [the practitioner is fasting], yet the vanity of the body is there – meaning: “I am embodied/I am the body” - the mind has this understanding. For this type of sadhak, there is the casting off of worldly experiences such as sound and touch etc.; this is true (this is because the natural result of the yogic act is that one goes above and experiences a type of samadhi — Begin Footnote. — The way that the traveling-show people hold their breaths in a near-death state during the female juggler's tricks – that is this type of samadhi. — End Footnote. — where one loses all awareness of the worldly experience); but because of being tied up by the bindings of body-vanity, that person's intellect does not get established [in Spirit]. Thus, that person cannot forget the taste of the enjoyments of the world. As soon as he/she sees the matters of enjoyment, the desires immediately rise up in the mind. But the one who has attained the state of Vishnu through Layayoga – because that sadhak's sky of inner consciousness is always floating in the Fire of Brahman (Luminosity), no other light/energy take place there. Thus, nothing of the world-experience remains for that sadhak; even the desire to taste such does not remain."
"60,61","O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! When the senses become “pramathi” [agitated], they can forcibly carry away the mind of even a person who is careful and completely aware of good and bad. For this reason, the Self-enjoined yogi, keeps all of those [senses] under control and is “matpara” [intent on the Self]. The one who has the senses under one's power – that is the person whose prajna is established.","The sense-organs are ten in number – five organs of action and five organs of perception. Even when they are not connected to the worldly experience, all of the sense-organs still become automatically active because of their natural functional tendencies. Then a type of affliction comes about. The desire to do more performance of Kriya gradually becomes stronger and goes on stirring the heart. Because the sense-organs have this kind of dharma [of agitation], they are called “pramathi” [agitated]. The person who has understood all of the spiritual subject matters and thereby ascertained the difference between good and bad, but still has not been able to bring all of that under his/her control, yet that sadhak continues to make effort according to the instructions – it is that person who is called “yatnasheel vipaschit” [diligent, wise one]. The mind of even this kind of discriminating sadhak can become drawn to sense-created matters. For this reason, the one who is a “yogi” - he/she gathers in all of the sense-organs, mentally takes them away from all of the matters of worldly partakings, and becomes “matpara” [intent on the Self] – meaning: binding the senses through the power of mind, that sadhak locks the mind in the Effulgent Supreme Person – meaning: has his/her intellect be established [in the Self]. If the sadhak does not become “matpara” in that state and is “prakritipara” [intent on Prakriti], — Begin Footnote. — See the next two slokas. Without controlling the sense-organs, one cannot become “matpara” [intent on the Self]; and if one is not “matpara,” one has to succumb to the powers of the sense-organs. — End Footnote. — then the sense-organs will capture the mind, and that is absolutely certain. But if one becomes “matpara,” then the sense-organs no longer have any power over the mind. It is for this reason that it has been said, “one whose sense-organs are under one's full control – that is the person whose prajna is established.”"
"62,63","If a person contemplates on worldly things, attachment/addiction is born for those things. From attachment/addiction, “kama” [lust; craving] arises, and from kama, anger comes in to being. From anger, one becomes enjoined to delusion. From delusion, memory is lost/corrupted. From the loss/corruption of memory, the intellect is destroyed. From the destruction of the intellect, life is destroyed (death).","Whether one controls the senses, or whatever it is that one does, if the mind is not made “matpara” [intent on the Self] and is [instead] made “vishayapara” [intent on worldly things] — Begin Footnote. — This is that which is called “mithyachar” [cultivation of the false]. See the sloka 6 of Chapter 3 [of the Gita]. — End Footnote. — – meaning: one takes up the matters of sound and touch and such [matters of the senses], then the mind will mix together with the worldly experiences, like milk with water (but if the mind is “matpara,” it is like butter with water, and cannot mix with the worldly experiences). From that mixing together or being enjoined [to worldly experiences], “kama” [lust; craving] – meaning: the desire to obtain/possess – becomes strong. This “expectation” form of desire is full of illusion. [It is like:] one has received so much wealth that one cannot carry it, yet there is still the desire that there should be more wealth. It is like: the fulfillment of desires has happened to a degree that the mind could not even previously imagine, but still the craving is not satisfied – this is, verily, Maya. It is from this unresolved craving that anger rises forth. The rising up of anger means that delusion has to come about – meaning: no discrimination remains regarding what should and should not be done. With the enjoinment to delusion, memory becomes corrupted – meaning: forgetting the “I” that is beyond the physical-subtle-causal bodies and imperceptible through words and mind, one has to succumb to the bindings of “me and mine” because of feeling that one is the impermanent body and such. When one falls into this delusion, the intellect is destroyed – meaning: the functional certainty of “I am the 'I'” - meaning: the steady faith [in the Self] is destroyed and the doubting functionalities come about. It is through this type of faithlessness and doubt that destruction – meaning: death – happens. This is because: at “prayankal” (the time of leaving one's body), the faithless and doubtful soul's mind (intellect), because it is not firm in the Self, goes on remembering the matters of the world, which becomes/is the seed of taking on a body once again. — Begin Footnote. — See the commentary on sloka 27 [of this Chapter 2].  — End Footnote. — "
64,But the one who is the unattached soul with a disciplined heart – that one is under the Power of the Self and is without like and dislike; even if that person goes about using the sense-organs – meaning: experiencing all of the things of the world – he/she attains Peace.,"In slokas 62 to 64 [of this Chapter 2], the “type” of the person has been divided into two parts. One is the worldly-matters-minded, undisciplined-hearted person, and the other is the non-desiring, disciplined-hearted person. The undisciplined one gets death, according to the progression stated in slokas 62 and 63. And the disciplined one goes according to that which is stated in sloka 64: that even while going through worldly experiences, that sadhak is without desire, and thus receives “prasad” [blessings] – meaning: witnesses the Peace-filled Supreme Substance of Vishnu. “PrasAdastu prasannatA” [may there be the blessing of Happiness]."
65,"When one receives “prasad” [blessings], all of one's sufferings end. The blessed and happy-hearted person's intellect, indeed very quickly, becomes still.","Earth, water, fire, air, ether – these five are known as “all.” This “all” covers up the inner sky in the form of “kashmal” [confused sights; see sloka 2 of this Chapter 2]. That is what is called “duhkha” [suffering; sorrow; pain]. When “prasad” is received – meaning: when the Effulgent Form appears, Its radiance dispels all darkness; not even any sign of impurities remain. Thus, the heart becomes blessed and happy – meaning: because it is pure, it becomes free of restlessness and becomes still. As soon as the heart is still, the thinking power finds no place in which to be, and because of this it extinguishes. — Begin Footnote. — This, verily, is “nirvana sthiti” [establishment in Nirvana] (“anmanaska-sthiti [establishment in no-mind]. The “brahmi sthiti” [establishment in Brahman; also written as one compound word “brahmisthiti”] stated in sloka 72 [of this Chapter 2] is there even in the waking state, and “Brahman-Nirvana” happens after the casting off of the body [death] – that which is called “videha mukti” [Liberation without the body/after the body is left behind]. — End Footnote. — “Chalachitte vaseshaktih sthirachitte vaseshivah” - iti Jnana Saṃkalaneetantram [in the moving mind/heart sits Shakti; in the still mind/heart sits Shiva – so says the Jnana Sankalanee Tantra [a scripture]. "
66,One who is “ayukta” [unconnected to the Self] has no intelligence and no “bhavana” [spiritual state of being; contemplation] either. Those who are without “bhavana” do not have peace. And where can there be happiness for those who are without peace?,"The one who has serenity, self-control, forbearance, austerity, reverence, resolve etc. of the “sadhana chatushtaya” [see footnote in Chapter 1, sloka 2 of the Gita for full definition] is “yukta” [connected]. — Begin Footnote. — See Chapter 5, sloka 12 of the Gita. — End Footnote. — The one who is “ayukta” [unconnected] – meaning: one who does not have sadhana chatushtaya (see the footnote in Chapter 1, sloka 2). Because that person's intellect is not fixed [in the Self], that intellect cannot be said to be the intellect of the path of yoga. And that person does not have “bhavana” [spiritual state of being; contemplation] — Begin Footnote. — “Bhavana” [spiritual state of being; contemplation] = being in “abhava” [lack; or: no mood] brings about the longing for “bhava” [spiritual state; or: mood]. This is the vritti [active thing] happening at this time (known through sadhana). See Chapter 8, sloka 3 for “bhava.” — End Footnote. — either, because his/her heart remains enamored to the attractiveness of the worldly experience and that person cannot hold to [or: concentrate on] the sphere of Divine Light. Those who do not have “bhavana” do not have peace – meaning: there is no calmness in the heart, because the mind is constantly engaged in the world and cannot find time to rest. This type of non-peaceful person has no happiness – meaning: because the inner sky remains covered by the clouds of the worldly experiences, there is no revelation of the Luminous Sphere."
67,"Just as the wind tosses about a boat on water, similarly, whichever thing the mind pursues of the senses which are world-oriented, that very thing destroys the inner perception.","Just by being a sadhak one knows that if the mind goes into the worldly experiences of sound and touch etc. [the sense perceptions], that itself brings about the end of the perception directed towards the Self."
68,"O mighty-armed one [Arjuna]! Indeed, it is for this reason that it has been said: “the one whose sense-organs have, in all ways, left the abode of the worldly things – that is the one whose prajna is established.","That is why one has to take all of the sense-organs from the worldly things, extinguish them and have complete self-control. Without “samyama” [see sloka 69 below] – meaning: without being “yukta” [enjoined to the Self; see commentary on sloka 66 of this Chapter 2], no sadhana happens at all. The self-controlled one is called “sthitaprajna.”"
69,"That which is night for all of phenomena, the “samyami” [see commentary below] one remains awake in that very thing. In that which all phenomena stays awake, that is the “drashta muni's” [seer sage's]  night.","When the mind stays in the Self, that time is “night” for all of the senses. At that time they stay in an inactive and dormant state. When the mind is in the worldly things, all of the senses are awake and active at that time. Keeping the mind in the Self is, verily, “samyama” (the coming together and union of dharana [concentration], dhyan [meditation] and samadhi). The one who is fixed in the Self is “samyami.” The aggregate of the senses is “phenomena.” When all of these phenomena have their “night,” at that time the samyami remains awake – meaning: at that time there is establishment in the Self; thus, that sadhak [at that time] is the seer, or witness, of the physical-, subtle- and causal-endowed universe-samsara. And because the mind is completely merged in the mind, that sadhak is “muni” [sage] (“muni saṃleenamAnasah” [one whose mind is merged is “muni”]). When the phenomena are awake, at that time it is “night” for that “drashta muni” [seer sage]. This is because at that time the mind becomes committed to worldly things; the field of the Self remains veiled by the covering of worldly experiences; and because of the Light of the Self not being seen, the path where the power of perception is in the direction of the Self is blocked. The mind, as well, because of having joined with the worldly experiences, remains disengaged in regards to the spiritual practice of the Self."
70,Just as a mass of water enters and fills the unmoving and fixed sea – the person to whom all desires enter in a similar way – it is that one who attains Peace and does not become a “kamakami” [desirer of desires].,"The sea is always in a full state because of the waters of rivers and such, but as its condition has no diminution or expansion, its foundation is unmoving. The one who has, through shambhavi [mudra], immersed the mind into the Bindu-Ocean (this is dependent on the performance of Kriya), and has become open-hearted within, all desires come there and are completely dissolved. From this person, no kind of desire arises to flow towards worldly experiences. Therefore, it is only this type of person who attains Peace. But the one who is “kamakami” [desirer of desires]- meaning: the one who, not having been able to cast the mind into Eternity, falls into Prakritic craving, thinking that the world with its experiences is the place of peace."
71,"The person who, upon having abandoned all desires, goes about as desireless, indifferent regarding personal involvement, and without ego – it is that person who attains Peace.","The [wish to] enjoy the worldly experience is called “kama” [desire; lust; craving] (hankering is also “kama”). Just by being a human being there are worldly experiences for enjoyment. However, those who progress a little in sadhana, their desires of those enjoyments become fulfilled (miracles). Putting mind into all of those things of enjoyment [mentioned in the previous sentence] – meaning: if one becomes “kamakami” [desirer of desires], one has to succumb to being bound; no further ascension happens. That person who has beaten away all of the things of enjoyment with his/her “broom,” and has become desireless – meaning: is without cravings, and [sees] “Atmano na tathA bhinnaṃ vishvamAtmavinirgataṃ” - that the universe which is within the Self is not different from the Self – one who, through this type of ascertainment, knows that “sarvaṃ brahmamayaṃ” [all is Brahman], and thereby becomes devoid of feeling “mine,” and in the end, being intoxicated in the Knowledge “I am That,” destroys the “me-ness” and becomes devoid of ego – and goes about in this way – that person attains the Eternal Bliss Peace. (This is the ultimate result of the spiritual act – the State of Perfection.)"
{72}{stop},"This is that which is “brahmisthiti” [establishment in Brahman]. Upon attaining this, one does not have to be deluded again. Even if one stays in this [samsara], one attains Brahman-Nirvana at the end of one's life.","If one goes about after having attained the state described in the previous sloka [71], the state that comes about – that is verily the State of Brahman-Knowledge - “brahmisthiti” [establishment in Brahman]. Because everything becomes Brahman in this “brahmisthiti,” even if one is with all external sense-matters – because there is no perception of differences, the inner and the outer become one, and one does not get deluded. Thus, in this state, even if one is living in the life of the world, at the time of leaving the body [death], “yatrayatra mano jAti tatraiva brahma lakshyate” - meaning: because everything is seen as Brahman, one attains the “no-return way” - Brahman-Nirvana.
