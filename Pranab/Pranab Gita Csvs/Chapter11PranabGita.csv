1,Arjuna said: “The Supreme Secret spiritual teaching (discerning the matters of Self and non-self) that You have now bestowed upon me out of your compassion for me – by that [teaching] my delusion has been destroyed.” ,"[At the end of the previous chapter [10], the Lord says “I am holding this entire creation by a fragment of Myself.” What is being expressed by that is that He is verily the Form of the Cosmos. With ecstatic mind, Arjuna, desiring to see that Cosmic Form, spoke these [first] four slokas one after the other.] The Supreme Secret teaching which is for the attainment of that Particle of “I”, that which no one can reveal in the outer world, that which is spiritually-adjoined – meaning: is the knowledge of the matters of the Self and the matters of the non-self, that which, can only be spoken about when dressed up as “you,” and cannot be spoken about if one is abiding in “I” (all of these things that I saw/realized in the previous chapters, or heard) – by this [teaching], the delusion of Maya to which I was subject has been dissolved."
2,"O Lotus Eyed One [Sri Krishna]! From You, I have now heard extensively about the creation and dissolution of phenomena; I have heard now about other Glories as well.","O Lotus Eyed One! When one looks at the back of a lotus leaf – the part that faces the water – one can see eye-like forms in every area; this is happening due to the veins of the leaf. Similarly, You are there in the Form of the Seer within every atom and particle. There is nothing anywhere that is hidden from Your Sight. The “bhava” – meaning: the matters of emergence, and “apyaya” – meaning: the matters of dissolution of all phenomena, as well as the matters of the Inexhaustible Glories of “I” – from You (meaning: when I was in the “I” State – from that State) I have heard [about these] extensively. I have seen. I have understood. "
3,O Parameshvara [Supreme God; Sri Krishna]! The way that You have spoken regarding the matters of the Self – it [the subject] is exactly like that. O Purushottama [Supreme Person; Sri Krishna]! I wish to see (that) Divine Form of Yours. ,"This “I” that has to be understood by going into the “you-consciousness,” the matters about Whom You have just spoken – it [the subject] is exactly like this. It [the “I”] is not otherwise. You are “Parameshvara” [Supreme God] – meaning: endowed with KnowledgeOpulence-Power-Strength-Potency-Energy/Light. O Purushottama [Supreme Person]! O the Life-Companion of the “you-consciousness”! I desire to see that Divine Form of Yours. All of the experiences that I have been having within – no doubt remains regarding them. But when I come out/outside, I mix up everything by seeing [reality as] this, that and the other. [I wish that You would] resolve these things for me. How is it that in one part – in one fragment – You are holding this entire creation – that is what I long to see. "
4,"O Lord [Sri Krishna]! If You feel that I am fit and capable of seeing That, then O Yogeshvara [Lord of Yogis; Sri Krishna], show me that Inexhaustible Self of Yours. ","O Lord! O Friend of the desperate and downtrodden! O Yogeshvara [Lord of Yogis]! (“Yogeshvara” means one who has no diminishing of the yogic state whether that being is in the “I” or the “you” state , or in whichever perception that being may be.) If I am deserving and fit to see that “I” State of Yours while I am in the “you-consciousness,” then show me, inside and outside together, the Inexhaustible State of the Self."
5,"The Lord said: “O Partha [Arjuna]! Behold My hundreds upon hundreds, thousands upon thousands of Forms – innumerable types, Divine (supernatural), and of many colors and shapes.” ","[The longings expressed by the sadhak being in the state of “jiva” [separate soul] in the previous four slokas [of this Chapter 10 of the Pranab Gita] – those longings are being resolved from being in the State of the Self in these slokas 5-8 [of Chapter 10 of the Pranab Gita]. The Cosmic Form is beginning to be seen via the Divine Eye.] O “Partha”! (“Pṛth kshepane” [thrown off by the earth principle] – the sadhak who is unable to stay in an unbroken way in the Consciousness of the Self – that is the one who is “Partha” [still somewhat of the earth].) Behold. See the Forms of “I”. Hundreds upon hundreds, thousands upon thousands, no end in sight, limitless – see how That is. See how “I” AM One and how “I” am many, and again how, being many, AM One. All of it is the work of Space. There are no substances of construction. — Begin Translator’s Note. — A Bengali statement of a colloquial type is used here to express “there are no substances of construction.” The statement is: “kaali, tuli, khad, maati – kichui nai” [ink, cotton [or: brush of the pen], hay, mud – nothing at all is there]. It is not possible to translate that statement in literal English without causing confusion. Thus, the translators, while being literal in every place possible in this translation of the Pranab Gita, have chosen to make an exception here and translate what is meant by the aforementioned expression. — End Translator’s Note. — All of the kinds of colors – all are of Space. Innumerable shapes are formed in Space, hanging in Space; there is nothing to lean on nor is there any support. Without any support, the manifestation of each of the shapes are happening as if by themselves. No one is there helping another [to be manifested]. All are manifesting by themselves. "
6,"O Bharat [Arjuna]! Behold the “Adityas,” “Vasus,” “Rudras,” the two “Ashvini kumars” and “Maruts.”","Behold! See the masses of Light filling the Sky like the effulgence of twelve suns together. There is no end to this Light, and at the same time the eyesight is not blinded. How incredible! And now look again and see within that very Light’s transformation – “Vasu” (see Chapter 10, sloka 23 [of the Gita]) – the individuated expression of a part of the Great Light. Rudran – (see Chapter 10, sloka 23 [of the Gita]) – the incomprehensible transmutation (destruction and transformation) – even looking at it with an unbroken focus, one cannot see the beginning and end of the transformation. Ashvinau – Now see again the Flowering Radiance of My Form[s]. One [Form] is blossoming and making another [Form] blossom. And another one blossoms and makes the blossoming blossom. See this/these heart-entrancing unbelievably beautiful Form/s. Marutah – Look again! All of those [expressions] break and there is the luminescent, shining, blazing ocean-waves – waves of Light! It is as if the forty-nine winds are blending together with the moon, sun and lightning and playing “holi” [festival of colors] in the Infinite Ocean’s Infinite Bosom. And how many more things there are that were previously unseen – those things that cannot be seen by anyone anywhere if they are in the nonsadhak [non-meditator] condition. See that as well! Oh, oh how wondrous! O Bharat [sadhak] – the sadhak whose consciousness is firmly established in the Light of Consciousness! Look, look! Look at all of these incredible happenings! "
7,"O Gudakesh [Arjuna]! Now [behold] the entire creation, the moving and the unmoving, within this Body of Mine, and whatever else you wish to see. All of that is existing together in just a part of My Body.","O Gudakesh! (“Gudaka” = sleep; “eesh” = ruler [one who has conquered sleep]; see Chapter 9, sloka 23 [of the Gita].) — Begin Translator’s Note — There is a possibility that the reference to Chapter 9, sloka 23 is a misprint. The translators have maintained the literal nature of this English translation and have kept the information in the parenthetical as it is. It is possible that the reference is meant to be the commentary to Chapter 1, slokas 24-25 of the Pranab Gita — End Translator’s Note. — This creation of the “sacharachar” [with the attributes of motion and inertia] (“char” = that which is moving about, the moving living beings; and “achar” = fixed; that which cannot move about – like trees, stones etc.) – behold how all of these are in one place in My Body. And see the dramascript of past-future-present (the victory, defeat and conflict occurring during your sadhana). Whatever you wish to see – see that itself."
8,"But you will not be able see Me by just these [physical] eyes of yours. (Therefore,) I am bestowing the Divine Eye to you. Behold My extraordinary Yogic Power.","These two [physical] eyes of yours – with these you can [only] see the things of the outer world (Prakritic material things). You will not be able to see “I”. The Yoga of “I” (meaning: how Maya becomes One with “I”, how Maya emerges, how Maya plays) – if that is to be seen, then that cannot be seen by the sight of those two eyes. Now I am bestowing upon you an Eye that is like Space (see the commentary to sloka 3 of Chapter 8 [of the Pranab Gita]), by which, you will be able to see My Yoga and Glories. Behold. — Begin Footnote. — Although all of the teaching that takes place at initiation is given in Chapter 8 [of the Gita], the action of the opening of the Eye of Knowledge is actually happening here [in sloka 11:8]. This is because: the fruit of initiation – the ability to see within – actually begins here [at this stage of the sadhak]. It is because of this fruit of initiation coming about that one prostrates to gurudeva by saying this statement: “chakshuranmeelitaṃ yena tasmai sriguruve namah” [the one by whom the eye is opened – to that divine guru do I prostrate]. — End Footnote. —"
9,"Sanjaya said: “O King [Dhritarashtra]! After speaking in this way, Mahayogeshvara Hari [Sri Krishna] revealed His Divine Form to Partha [Arjuna].","“Saṃ” + “jaya” = “sanjaya” [can be transliterated from Sanskrit as “saṃjaya” as well, but is pronounced in Bengali as “sanjaya”] – meaning: the settled state that is there upon having the knowledge of cause, action, quality and meaning – that is the state of “sanjaya.” When the sadhak looks downward while being in the Ajna-chakra and sees the sport of the phenomenal world – it is at that time that the sadhak has no attraction for any worldly experience. This detached perception [with no attraction to the world] is that which is called Divine Sight. This is verily the sadhak’s state of “sanjaya.” Whatever is being seen and experienced/felt while being in this state – that is what is being expressed as “Sanjaya said.” All of these are internal, mind to mind. In this state, the mind is the speaker; the mind is the listener. As speaker, one is Sanjaya; as listener, one is Dhritarashtra [see commentary to Chapter 1, sloka 1 of the Pranab Gita], who, as he is the experiencer/owner of the pleasures and pains of the kingdom of the body, is known as “king.” Greater than the greatest, Yogeshvara [the Lord of yoga/yogis] Hari (one who does “haran” [takes away] of “sarva” [all that exists in creation]) bestowed upon Arjuna the Divine Eye and revealed to him that Reality of God – “Param” [Supreme]. "
"10,11","(That Form) is with many mouths and eyes, many wondrous manifestations, many Divine Ornaments, many upheld Divine Weapons, Divine Garlands and Divine Vestments, is full of Divine Scents, is completely wondrous, Radiant and Infinite, and is facing in all directions. ","[The Form is with] many mouths, many eyes, [and there are] many incredible sights (which have not been previously seen in sadhana); there are many ornaments, and many weapons and missiles ([see] Chapter 10, sloka 31 [of the Gita]) are being held. All are formed out of Space! Garlands made out of Space, Vestments made out of Space – all are blazing forth with the Light of that Form. The anointing substances of vermillion, musk and sandal are in Space; all are wondrous. The Form is shadowless, immeasurably Luminous. Not just one or two things – the manifestations are innumerable. Whatever known or unknown that there is in the universe-sheath – all of it is coming out. (See “vishvatomukhah” in Chapter 10, sloka 33 [of the Gita].)"
12,"If the radiance of a thousand suns together at one time were seen in the sky, then perhaps that splendor would resemble the Brilliance of that Great Spirit. ",The Light of the Universal Form is so powerful and is so much that It has no end. If an infinite number of suns rose at once and shone together – the combined brilliance from those suns – it would lose to the Brilliance of this Light. There is no comparison! No comparison! 
13,Then Arjuna beheld the divided innumerable parts of the entire creation situated together in the Body of that God of gods. ,"In the Body of that Vasudeva [the Omnipresent Lord], everything that there is – inanimate and animate (meaning: from a single particle to Shiva and such, and even all micro-beings) – however many kinds of things that can be seen in the universe-sheath – everything is there together. Through perfected awareness in sadhana, the sadhak (Arjuna) began to behold that. "
14,"After that, Arjuna, being astonished, and with thrills running through his body, prostrated his head to the Lord, and with joined palms in reverence and gratitude, spoke. ","Dear sadhak! Now see! When this kind of state comes upon you – at that time the hairs on your body stand on end. That which is beyond the physical eyes, which you have not seen before – because you become full of awe and wonder upon seeing that, the word “vismayAviShTa” [filled with astonishment; see first line of above sloka for the occurrence of the word [with a different declension]] is being used. And because – in this state – you are disconnected from anything that gives rise to birth, death, pleasure, pain, hunger, thirst etc. because you are completely intoxicated in the Cause of the Supreme Deed, you are at that time “Dhananjaya” [victorious over possessions/attachments]. At that time, the movement of your prana and apana take place in such a subtle way that you become unaware of it, and you go up to the head (within the Sahasrar), and abide there like Space in the Immensely Beautiful Sky of Consciousness. That [subtle] operation of prana and apana – that is actually that which is called “pranam” [reverent prostration]. (Going downward once and going upward once is that which is called “pranam” [reverent bowing/prostration]. And that state of abidance of yours – that is that which cannot be expressed by speech. In order to speak of it, one has to come down and speak. At that time, all activities remain still. And at the same time, they are not inoperative either. Yet, the junction of these two – the joining of the left and the right – the left is the adverse way and the right is the way of the Self – the joining of these two is called “sandhi” [junction], and that “sandhi” is being called “kritanjali” [joined palms in reverence]. That Unthinkable, Inexpressible state which, is free of qualities and at the same time endowed with qualities, is the very Foundation of this creation. It is not separate from you [the being], and at the same time, It appears to be separate as well, which is why the term “Deva” [Divine Being as separate from oneself] is being used. And “abhashata” [spoke; see end of above sloka]? After surrendering yourself like that, you cannot just remain without speaking praise. That praise is your “prabhashana” [soliloquy; spoken ovation; speech]."
15,"Arjuna said: “O Lord! I see in Your Body all gods, all of the kinds of living beings and phenomena such as mammals etc., divine sages, all of the serpents and the lord of creation Brahmaa seated on a lotus-dais.”","Now, with the functionality of seeing in the direction of Brahman being active, the sadhak is witnessing within his own body the Cosmic Form. Without being a seer, one cannot see that which is to be seen. Dressing up oneself as the “seer,” making the cosmos into “you” and the “seen,” the sadhak, forgetting the Selfness of the Self, is overcome by the Cosmic Form, and is saying, “O Lord! In Your Divine Body – it is all the Grand Sport of Space. Scent from earth, taste from water, sight from fire, touch from air and sound from space are becoming the five causes in Space and only Space. The causal effects of the mixing of the three gunas – sattva, rajas and tamas – are manifesting wondrous things. All of the creative power of Prakriti – all of it is coming about in one place like a magic show. There is no end to creation. In that place, Brahmaa, the god of creation, is seated on a lotus-dais; all of the gods, the lineages of sages, the lineages of serpents are all there. All of it is mutation of space into form. (Dear sadhak! With due care, relate this with all of your visions in Kutastha.) "
16,"O Lord of the universe! O Cosmic Form! I see You everywhere with many arms, bellies, mouths, eyes, and with infinite forms. And I am also seeing You as having no end, no middle and no beginning. ","I see so many bellies, so many arms/hands, so many mouths, so many eyes – there is no end to it. I am looking in ten directions [all around]. In no side can I discern a beginning, end or middle. O Lord of the universe! Is this Your Cosmic Form?"
17,"I see You wearing a crown, holding a mace, blazing everywhere with masses of light, dazzling the gaze, shining with radiance like fire and sun, and immeasurable. ","Some are wearing “kireet” [crown] (“kireet” is headwear/hat that has a spire, is embedded with jewels-pearls-rubies [meaning: bejeweled] with tassels hanging). Some have a mace/club in their hands. Some have a discus [whirling weapon]. All are masses of light. The effulgence dazzles the eyes (but there is no discomfort in seeing it). What is this vision I am seeing?! It is difficult to keep my sight settled when looking at Your Form. It is beyond imagination/comparison. It is as if the sun, lightning and fire have mixed together and are blazing forth with light. "
18,"You are the Supreme Indestructible One. (You are the One Who is) that which is to be known. You are the Supreme Resting Place of this universe. You are Inexhaustible, and the director of the Eternal Dharma. You are the Universal Being. (This is verily) my perception (firm belief).","“Tvamaksharam” = You are “akshara” [indestructible] – that which cannot be destroyed/that which cannot perish (see Chapter 8, sloka 3); “paramam” [supreme] = You are Brahman; “veditavyam” = You are the Thing that is to be known; You are “avyaya” [inexhaustible] = Limitless; “shAshvata” [eternal] = You are forever existing; “dharmagoptA” [secret protector of dharma] = You are actually the universe itself, but it looks as if You are the Support of the universe. This veil – this is what has made You the Lord of Your Secret; “sanAtana” [universal] = You are the perfect, beginning-less Eternity; “puruSha” [being; person] = You are the Inner Spirit/Being within that which is meant as “sarva” [all that exists in creation; the experiences of the 24 tattvas [elements]]. — Begin Translator’s Note — The Bengali text regarding the word “puruSha” – “sorbo [sarva] shobder [shabder] orther ontoraattaa tumi” can also be translated thus: “You are the Inner Spirit/Being within the meanings of every word.” However, the word “sarva” [every; all] has been used very specifically in the Pranab Gita to be a word that means “all that exists in creation” or “the experiences of the 24 tattvas [elements].” The translation that is presented in the main body of the text takes that previous usage of the word “sarva” into consideration. This version of the translation in the main text aligns more appropriately with the sloka and its commentary than the alternative version provided at the beginning of this footnote. — End Translator’s Note — This, verily, I have understood. "
19,"I see you as: without beginning, middle or end, with limitless Power, with infinite numbers of arms, with eyes of the moon and the sun, with fire blazing from Your mouth, burning all of this universe with the heat of Your fire. ","You have no beginning, end or middle. You are Limitless. There is no end to Your Splendor, Glory, Capability. You are Limitless. Your Active Power is present equally in everything/everywhere. You are Limitless. You are more Ferocious than ferocity itself, and more Beautiful than beauty itself – the Self witnessing the Self. Your mouth is blazing with flames of fire. With Your Energy, this creation is burning ([but] does not melt). I am seeing this."
20,"O Great Spirit! It is You Who pervade this “antar” [inner part] (“antareeksha” [part within]) “svarga” [heaven] and “prithivi” [earth], as well as every direction that there is. I am seeing that the three planes are quite stunned (afraid) upon witnessing this terrible and astonishing Form of Yours.","The place where the gods live – meaning: during the time of meditation, the place where the sadhak sees luminous forms that have no shadows – that is the place called “svarga” [heaven]. The sound “svr” means “making sound” (“svara” [musical tones]), and “gai” means “to do ‘gaana’” [to sing]. Upon the driving of prana-vayu (by the guruinstructed method), the place from where the seven “svaras” [musical tones] are heard – it is that place that is called “svarga.” (It can be known through sadhana.) And the place of action – meaning: the residing place for those who carry physical bodies [embodied beings] is called “prithivi” [earth]. And the space between these two – meaning: the void-abode – that is called “antareeksha” [the part within]. “Antar” means the inner part – meaning: the place in the middle [of some area], “eeksha” means “seeing.” Ohhh! Oh – oh – oh! In all of the ten directions [meaning: all around] of these three places, You are pervading as One. There is no place where You are not. There is no thing that is not You. O Great Spirit! I am seeing that those three abodes are full of great fear because of Your unimaginable (that which I have not seen before) and fierce (terrifying) Form. "
21,"All of the divine beings are entering You (surrendering). Some are trepidatiously praying with joined palms (saying from afar: “save us; save us”). The great sages and perfected beings are saying “svasti” [glory to You], and are singing hymns, extolling You with words of praise.","“Am[a]” = having illness/disease; and “in” = staying. Being ill is called “amee.” The word “hi” means “certainty.” “SurasanghA” = the aggregate of gods; “tvAm” = in You; “vishanti” = entering [see first line of above sloka for the occurrence of these words]. Those luminous gods are like ill beings with no light when compared to Your Light, and they are entering You. As well, some are full of fear, and, with joined palms, they are saying, “save us; save us.” And the realized beings and great sages are all saying “svasti” [praise to You], and are blessing this creation with this blessed utterance. This is because: if this creation were not there, then we would not be able to see this Form of Yours which is beyond all forms; and thus, they are singing hymns of the highest praise to You. This means: one has become intoxicated by the Cosmic Form and is saying, “Here it is! This is Your Form beyond all forms! “Ritam” [governance], “satyam” [truth], “param” [supreme]. Lo! ‘Jai jagadish hare’ [glory to the Lord of creation].” “hare murAre madhukaiTabhAre gopAla govinda mukunda shaure yajnesha nArAyaNa kṛShNa viShNo nirAshrayaṃ mAṃ jagadeesha raksha” [Hari, the destroyer of Mura, Madhu and Kaitabha Gopal, Govinda, Mukunda, the greatest of heroes The Lord of the yajnas, [is] Narayana, Krishna, Vishnu I am without refuge; save me O Lord of the universe]"
22,"“Rudra[s],” “ditya[s],” “vasu[s],” the gods called “sadhya[s]” (them), “vishva-deva[s],” the two “Ashvini kumars,” “marut[s],” ancestors, “gandharva[s]-yaksha[s]-asura[s]-siddha[s]” – all are beholding You with astonishment.” ","Eleven “rudras” ([see] Chapter 10, sloka 23), eight “vasus” (see Chapter 10, sloka 23), [twelve] “sadhyas” ([named:] “Manah,” “Manta,” “Prana,” “Sara,” “Paana,” “Veeryavan,” “Vinirbhaya,” “Laya,” “Dangsha,” “Narayana,” “Vrisha,” and “Prabhu” – these twelve types of gods), “vishva-devas” ([named:] “Vasu,” “Satya,” “Kratu,” “Vaksha,” “Kaal,” “Kama,” “Dhriti,” “Kuru,” “Pururava,” and “Madrava” – these ten types of “ganadevatas” [gods of a certain type], the two “Ashvini kumars” [mythical figures], “maruts” (“mr” = “mara” [dying]; “ut” = “making it be” – meaning: one, or ones, who, if angered, can cause death – that one is, or they are, called “marut/s” – meaning: the forty-nine types of vayus [airs; vital-airs], “ushmapa” – meaning: ancestors (these are of seven lineages: “Agnishvatta,” “Saumya,” “Havishvanta,” “Ushmapa,” “Sukalina,” “Vahirda,” “Ajyapa”), “gandharvas” [celestial beings] such as “Haha,” “Huhu” etc., “yakshas” [celestial beings] such as “Kubera,” etc., “asuras” [imperfect supernatural beings] such as “Virochana” etc., “siddhas” [perfected beings] such as “Kapila” etc. – all are absolutely astonished (with stupefied faces) beholding You. Dear sadhak! Keep staring in that dumbfounded way. Relate it [to your experience]."
23,"O “Mahabahu” [Mighty-armed One; Sri Krishna]! Seeing Your terrifying Form with many mouths, many eyes, many arms, many thighs and many feet, many bellies and many teeth, all beings are stricken with terror, as too am I. ","O “Mahabahu” [Mighty-armed One; Sri Krishna]! (One for Whom everything with a beginning, end and middle is under complete control in His hands – He is the One Who is called “Mahabahu.”) “Roopam mahatte” [huge form] – this Enormous Form of Yours is even beyond Mahat [the place/source from which the apparent world comes]. You have no Form. This is because You are without beginning; You are without end. Form exists with beginning and with end. But You have even taken Mahat into Your abyss, and are existing as One Form in such a Way – there are no words in language for that; it cannot be said with speech. Still, that Form that is appearing in that Mahat of Yours – in that, there are innumerable mouths, eyes, arms/hands; innumerable thighs, feet/legs, bellies; innumerable horrifying teeth. Seeing that, all of the worlds of beings are terrified and filled with anxiety; I too am terrified. (Dear sadhak! Relate this to that feeling of yours at that time; and go on connecting it.)"
24,"O Vishnu! Upon seeing You as pervading within [all], illuminated, with many forms and with gaping mouth, and with fiery, gigantic eyes, I am fearful in my heart, and I cannot find steadiness or tranquility.","O Vishnu! (The One Who pervades all of the universe like ghee existing within milk – He is the One Who is called “Vishnu.”) It is as if You have taken Space into You, and there are many forms, beyond measure; that gaping mouth of Yours with blazing flames coming forth from it, and that intensely bright mass of light that is Your expansive Eye – seeing that, my inner being is trembling with fear. I am not able to be steady or properly keep my equipoise. "
25,"O Lord! Seeing Your many horrifying, teeth-filled mouths flaming with the fire of final destruction, I have lost sense of any of the directions. I cannot find comfort. Be appeased, O Home of the universe. ","O Lord! It is as if the light from the horrifying teeth in Your terrifying mouth is like the creation-destroying lightning of the time of dissolution. I am seeing them like flames of fire taking over all directions. I have lost sense of all directions. And I cannot feel any comfort at all. O Home of all creation, be appeased. "
"26,27","All of those sons of Dhritarasthra, along with the kings of the world, are entering into You with torrential force, and Bhishma, Drona and “Sutaputra” (Karna), along with the great warriors from our side as well, are going into Your terrifying mouth through Your awfully fearsome teeth. I am seeing that the heads of some (among them) are being crushed and that they are stuck between those teeth. ","Unless a stake is driven through the worldly experience in the inner being, no one can ever have the respite to look towards Liberation. The Liberation-desiring sadhak thinks of the worldly experience in the inner being – comprised of lust and such – as being one’s adversary, and takes discrimination/discernment, detachment and such as one’s own. The sadhak even practices/serves those [qualities of detachment etc.]. But as one goes on rising up, so do those things that are “one’s own” start to fall off one by one; it is experienced directly. This is because there cannot be Liberation as long as there are things remaining that are endowed with beginnings and ends (meaning: the idea of “avoiding” [disconnecting from absolutely everything; or keeping something good and discarding the bad] is meaningless). Thus, in the beginning, the things that appear to be “against” one have to be rooted out, directly. [However], whatever is born of the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness], all of that is distortion [of Reality]. There is no good and bad attributed to them. The worldly experience is desire, and that “that Liberation, oh I just about have it” – that is also desire. Some a little before, some a little later – but I see that no one is being spared from burning in the Fire of Brahman. The reflected consciousness, impressions, desire to do duty, discrimination/discernment, detachment – all are going away. "
28,"Just as all rivers with their many torrential currents go towards the sea and enter the sea itself – in the same way, all of those heroic ones of the human world are entering Your omnipresent and blazing mouths. ","“NaralokaveerA” – “na” = negation; “rah” = revelation; illumination – meaning: one in whom there is no light that illuminates either oneself or anything else– that is called “nara” [no light]. For as long as the human being stays with the greed of grasping and rejecting, for that long is the human being [in the state of] “nara.” “Nara” means that which has no light. “Loka” [abode[s]] means all that is visible. And “veera” [conqueror] means that which has the capability to bind/capture. Thus, [“naralokaveera” means] the sights which are without illumination, which are Mayic things, and which also have the power to bind. Whatever/whomever is like this – that thing/that one is “naralokaveera.” Now dear sadhak, see. The good and bad things springing forth from your antahkarana – due to the current of samskaras [latent tendencies], they come from somewhere, show themselves to you, bind you in your antahkarana with their impressions, and within a moment enter into that destructive light. All of this is Space. Even if appearing as imaginary flowers [beautiful things], they are [nevertheless] against the path of Brahman. That is why it is being said: just as water runs with torrential force into the ocean and blends with it, and just as it has no more beingness – in the same way, that falsehood of Maya – all of those “naralokaveera” – are losing their beingness by falling into Your light – meaning: the sadhak’s delusional ignorance is being resolved."
29,"Just as insects fly speedily into the flaming fire and die, in the same way, all beings/things are speedily entering into death in all of Your mouths. ","Just as flying insects get drawn in by the current of the blazing fire, and they fall and die in it – in the same way, the emergenceand destruction-endowed abodes of impure ignorance (whatever there is that is seen) are coming to their extinction in Your mouth, like darkness ending when there is light."
30,"With all mouths flaming, all of the “lokas” [people; planes] are being swallowed and being fully tasted [in the mouths]. O Vishnu! All of Your fiercely intense flames are permeating and burning everything in the entire creation. ","Dear sadhak! Relate this state to the state during your sadhana, and be free of fear. Indivisible time has been bound up with the three divisions of past, future and present only to allow one to perceive changes. If one just slips off of the very subtle present, the changes of the changeable come to an end – meaning: they return to the abyss of the Changeless. That Changeless State is “Vishnu” or the state of Omnipresence. Following the progression of time (at the time of Kriya), when the sadhak sees the changeable [creation] change in that Changeless One due to the appearance of torrential events (meaning: when the sadhak sees the substances of the present from the abyss of the past), then the sadhak feels: “Lo! This changing samsara-universe – it is as if it is entering an incinerating, immense mouth, and it is as if that universe-consuming mouth is chewing and chewing, tasting the taste of the universe and swallowing it into its stomach. "
31,"Who are You – with such a terrifying form? Tell me. I bow to you. O Greatest of gods, be appeased. I want to know You well, O Primal Person, as I do not know anything about Your actions (works). ","Upon experiencing this incredible state, along with excitement, a great longing appears in the sadhak’s mind to know what is beyond the heavy experience [that the sadhak is going through at this time]. With that, there is this understanding. Oh, what is this?! Space is the subtlest of all elements. Through the physical eyes, the sky appears a great distance away with an illusory blue color. But right now, I have my eyes closed. Thus, I am seeing the play of an incredible vision that is far more subtle than space itself. And the One who is swallowing even that extremely subtle vision into His stomach – Who is this One who is subtler and beyond the subtlest? “Akhyahi me” – tell me. “Ko bhavAn ugraroopah” – this fierce form – who are You? Greater than humans are the space/skyresiding gods. You are greater than even them. Therefore, O Greatest of gods! I bow to You! O Greatest of the greatest! I bow to You. “Praseeda” – be appeased; have mercy. “VijnAtumicchhami” – I so want to know. I am unable to comprehend Your beginning, end and middle, Your actions and Your power"
32,"The Lord said: “I am the loka-destroying [manifestation destroying], overpowering Time. I have now become engaged in order to destroy all lokas [planes; people; manifestation]. (Thus,) even without you killing them, all of the warriors that are present here on their respective sides – none of them will remain.” ","Whatever the astonished sadhak has just seen from [still] abiding in Prakriti – now, with his/her own experience, the sadhak is resolving those very things. The sadhak is observing: whatever I am seeing, I am actually seeing it/them with closed eyes. Is it possible to see with the eyes closed? It is with open eyes that people see all the things that are outside and are separate from the body. That is what is usually called “seeing.” Now what kind of seeing is this? None of this is outside! Everything is within me! O Lord. All of the activities of creation, preservation and destruction are actually happening within me! Yet, I am not touching them, nor am I doing anything. What to say, I am seeing that not even a little bit of change is happening to me. So that is how it is! So it means that the abode where karmas end is the “I” in me? Lo! Who is this “I”? The One Whose food is karma itself – is it so that that karma-eater is “I”? Now what in the world is this that I am knowing? Who is this “I”? “KAlo’smi lokakshayakṛt pravṛddhe” – the immense, boundless loka-destroying [manifestationdestroying] Time am “I”. Now I have become engaged in taking away (destroying) those lokas [planes; people; manifestation]. O Arjuna! All of those [beings/attributes] of the two sides that you see that have come to fight – now even if you do not do battle (do Kriya), not a single one of them will remain alive in the future. This is because the sadhak is seeing this: the kind of “time” that is arising due to the fruits of Kriya – at that, all are being ended automatically in the “I” Itself. The “I” is without end. "
33,"Therefore, rise up (for battle). Gain fame. Defeat your enemies and enjoy prosperous kingship. All of these (your enemies) have already been killed by Me even before the war. O Savyasachin [ambidextrous one]! You are merely an instrument [for the inevitable event to take place].","Therefore, there is nothing for you to fear any more. Everything Prakritic, such as the reflected consciousness etc. – all of it is just an illusory trick of the Maya-enjoying ahamkar [false “I”; ego]. The day that the jiva [soul] forgot the True “I” and took its place in the false “I” – it is from that day onward that the soul took up the dharma of death. So, what reason do you have now for being despondent?! All of them, due to inevitable law, will have to be consumed by Me as Time anyway. Therefore, rise up to do battle. “UttiShTha” [rise up] – rise up to do battle. At the time of battle, the warrior in the chariot has to sit steadily and firmly in a kneeling position with the buttocks resting on the feet. Instead of that, Arjuna, falling under the spell of having compassion and concern for relatives and his own people and such, put down his bow and arrows, took his legs out from that position and sat in a lax and squatted form in the chariot. That is why the Lord is now saying, “uttishtha” [rise up] – meaning: get up and sit in a way appropriate and conducive to fighting. At the time of sadhana [meditation], the very same condition comes upon the sadhak [meditator]. After respite, the sadhak too has to sit up – meaning: taking the legs and fixing them in the seated position according to instructions, making the spinal column straight and upright, and holding the chest held upwardly straight, one has to make the body firm [in the seated position]. And then, the mind has to be fixed at the “pa” place above the five elements – meaning: the mind has to be established on top of the “granthi” [junction]. Sitting upright in this way, one has to do Kriya of pranayam and such. This actually is the instruction given in this sloka through the usage of the word “uttishtha.” After that, the Lord is saying, “yasho labhasva” [gain fame; renown]. What is “yash” [fame; renown]? “Yash” [renown] is the expanding of the dominion of the Self throughout all, resulting due to the practice of good works. Before attaining perfection in sadhana [spiritual practice], the Prakritic state remains predominant; the dominion of the Self remains subdued [before attaining perfection]. When perfection is attained, the Prakritic current becomes powerless. At this time, the current of the Self reigns with power. That is “yash” [renown]. That is the beginning of “Kaivalya” [Only-ness] – meaning: letting go of everything except “I”, one becomes the “One and Only” – the state where contraction is destroyed and One is the Expanse. “JitvA shatrun bhungshva rAjyaṃ samṛddham” [being victorious over your enemies, enjoy the prosperous kingship] – (see the commentary to Chapter 2, sloka 8). Be victorious over the enemy-side – meaning: conquer the evil tendencies such as lust, exemplified by Duryodhana and such, and enjoy the problem-free kingdom/kingship – meaning: be jivanmukta [Liberated while alive in the body]. And until the body is discarded [until physical death] – like the way the sky does not experience the chaos and force of an intense storm because it is unattached to the storm – in the same way, you as well remain unattached, and go on enjoying Maya and the Goddess Maya’s enjoyments. Finally, He [Sri Krishna] says, “O Savyasachi [spelling variation], I have already killed all of these [beings; attributes]. You are just an instrument [for the event to take place]!” Through this statement, the Lord has resolved a very complex issue. In samsara [the worldly experience], human beings have lost their sensibilities by believing in the egoistic worldly experience and saying/believing, “I am the one who is doing; I am the one who is doing.” No, no. The human being is not the doer. The human being is only the instrument of action. The ordainer of the fruits of actions is another Ruler, Who is One without a second. Thus, the human being only has the right to act, not the right to the result. By being an instrument, the human being may begin an action – [like] mixing together two or more substances, such as pulverized limestone and turmeric. This operation of mixing is the only bit that [the human being] is capable of doing. But the chemical reaction that takes place that causes the red color to come forth due to the mixing together of pulverized limestone and turmeric – there is no adeptness of the human being that makes that happen. That is the law of the Governor. That law does not change. If turmeric and limestone powder are mixed together, the mixture will become red for certain. It will not become black or some other color. In the same way, if two parts “jalajan” essence (hydrogen) and one part “amlajan” essence (oxygen) mix together, then, for certain, water will be the result. No one can create a different result out of it. All of these types of fixed laws have existed before creation. Thus, whenever that type of action is that will take place – at that time, the fruits of that action will be according to that [action]. In all of the matters of creation, the relationship of karma [action] and karmaphala [results of actions] solely follow this system. The human being is only an excuse/instrument. The ordainer of the fruits is that One without a second, Unimaginable Person in the Form of “I”. Now, this time that has arrived (whether you see it as historical, or as yoga-sadhana) – in this too, that same law is present. Before this standing in the middle area between the two sides of soldiers took place, all of the actions that had happened to bring about this war – [including] the attainment of “savyasachi” [spiritually ambidextrous] that has come about due to the practice of “yama” [stopping of unspiritual actions] and “niyama” [practicing of spiritual actions] and other such practices of the limbs of yoga – the inevitable fruits of [such actions that have already taken place] are now being realized. The inevitable consequence is happening. If at this very time the weapon in the form of pranayam is applied, the lower vrittis [functionalities; automatic tendencies], such as those represented by Duryodhana and such along with Bhishma and Drona and such, will most certainly be annihilated. It will happen automatically. All of those are, already beforehand, “mayaiva nihatAh” [killed by Me, verily] – meaning: the fruits ordained by the Ordainer, the “I”, are already set according to law. Now there is no way of making another kind of result come about. Doing pranayam is only using an instrument/excuse [for the event to happen]. The state to which the sadhak [spiritual practitioner] has now come, upon having become “savyasachi” [spiritually ambidextrous] – because of that, whether he/she wants to or does not want to, the sadhak will have to participate as the instrument. There is no way the sadhak will be able to avoid that. This is because: “svalpamapyasya dharmasya trAyate mahato bhayAt” [even a little of this dharma delivers one from great fear] – according to this statement, the sadhak will never again have to become wrapped up in the earthly part [of being]. And after that: “purvAbhyAsena tenaiva hṛyate hyavasho’pi sah” [due to prior practice, one is carried forward, even without willing to do so] – according to this teaching, the sadhak will most certainly have to go towards Brahman, regardless of his/her will. Later, “kartuṃ necchasi yanmohAt kayisShyasyavasho’pi tam” [because of your actions and your nature, you will do even that which, because of delusion, you do not wish to do] – according to this statement, the sadhak will be forced to act, even if the sadhak does not wish to do so, due to being under the power of results of his/her own karma [previous actions]. Thus, the sadhak has no way of escaping this. The actions that have already been done – the sadhak inevitably has to take part in their results. If now the sadhak exerts his/her own will and does not become the instrument, then the sadhak will not attain “yash” [renown] – [meaning:] the spreading of the State of the Self over Prakriti; the sadhak will not enjoy “asapatnaṃ ṛddham rAjyam” [unrivaled, prosperous kingship], and neither will the sadhak attain the everlonged-for “jivanmukti” [Liberation while living in the body]. The sadhak will fail. And because of that unfulfilled longing [due to not participating in the spiritual task], the seed of samsara will remain in the sadhak. Therefore, the sadhak, under the power of time, will again, for certain, have to return to the path of samsara. This is because desire has such a quality – that it will have to be fulfilled at some point. Without experiencing the result of the desire, the karma will not be dissolved. — Begin Footnote. — Whatever endeavors/rites are taken to attain a wanted thing – that effort for the wanted thing is itself the craving. That itself is the bondage. Without experiencing it, it does not dissolve. And the endeavors/rites that are taken without the wanting of a result, that is not actually a desire. Therefore, that is not bondage. Its result does not come about. Nevertheless, that [act] does cause the consciousness to be distracted and hampers the performance of karma [spiritual practice]. — End Footnote. — If there is no wanting, then no goal remains. But that is impossible because the root cause of taking action is desire itself. Thus, one cannot become desireless without having experienced the fruit of desire. The brilliant example of this is in the enjoyment of the kingdom by Dhruva [a mythological character]. And now, if the sadhak does desire to take part and becomes the instrument, then the State of the Self will expand through and over all, and the sadhak will attain the renown in the form of having conquered Prakriti. Through the attainment of the state of jivanmukta, the sadhak will satisfy all wants, and thereby all of the seeds of desire will be destroyed. Therefore, the sadhak will never again enter samsara! That is why the Lord is saying: “Through the law of karma, I have already killed all of these [beings; attributes] (meaning: what will happen or not happen, I have predetermined that); you just be an instrument, and end your prarabdha [karmic consequences from previous lives] through experiencing [that which you must] and attain the samadhi which has no seeds [of the worldly experience].” If the sadhak who has perfected the seated posture simply performs the “sahaj karma” [natural/easy act], all [spiritual] operations take place automatically. All of the fruits of yoga come about. Laying down on a bed, as sleep overcomes one, one experiences many states with numerous kinds of sights and sounds due to the fruits of previous actions. But all of that is unreal. Similarly, if one sits in a steady posture and goes about doing Kriya according to guru’s instructions, “yoga-nidra” [yogic sleep] comes automatically, and “prabodhsamay” [time of knowing] comes. At that time, one knows, and, as well, one attains the realization of the non-dual Self (“AtmAnamevAdvayam” [the Self, verily, is not two]). All of that is the Truth and not delusional. Just sticking with doing the karma [spiritual act] while sitting in the steady posture, just as one simply lays in bed, is that which is called “being an instrument.” The inevitable fruit of being an instrument in that way is this: by abiding in the State of the Self, all of the desires of samsara [latent and evident] and the lower vrittis [functionalities] that support such desires are completely annihilated. No possibility of them ever rising up again remains at all. The Lord, addressing Arjuna as “Savyasachi,” is actually showing him that he is perfectly fit to be the instrument. One whose right and left hands/arms work with equal adeptness – that is the person called “Savyasachi.” When, for the sadhak, the vayu [vital-air] is truly moving in the sushumna, then the dual motion of exhalation and inhalation flows equally and easily through both nostrils. And the drawing and expelling movements of the vayu also become equal. The ten-finger-length entering and the twelve-finger-length exiting also are resolved. There are no hindrances at all. The one who is in this particular state – that is the one who is called “Savyasachi” [at ease with both]. In this state, non-attachment takes over the sadhak. The non-sadhaks commit the error of not being an instrument even in this state. That is why it is being said, “Only be an instrument.” "
34,"Kill Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Jayadratha and the other heroic warriors, all of whom have already been killed by Me. Do not be afraid. Fight. You will be able to conquer the enemies in war","“Bhishma” = ego born of ignorance; “Drona” = intellect born of samskaras [latent tendencies/impressions]; “Jayadratha” = anxiousness or the fear of death; “Karna” = attachment to obligatory work (see Chapter 1, slokas 8-9); and the other desire-associated warriors – they have already died because of having taken refuge in that false “I”. And Arjuna! You? You, abiding in the Real “I”, have already become victorious over the adversaries in war. Where is there any fear in this?"
35,"Sanjaya said: “Hearing these words from Keshava [Sri Krishna], Arjuna, trembling, bowed to Krishna with joined palms, and, with great fear, prostrated to Him and spoke in a faltering voice.”","The unperfected sadhak cannot remain in the Settledness in Brahman for very long, nor can he/she move to a higher place with the current of the upward progression for long, if the experiential analysis remains. Therefore, one has to come down. The experience that is realized after coming down – that actually happens from the Ajna-chakra. The five elements such as earth etc. are in the five chakras such as Muladhar etc. Those five elements are, verily, “sarva” [“all”]! The Ajna-chakra is above those five. If the lower five are not conquered, then one cannot have the right to abide at the Ajna-chakra. The sadhak who abides at the Ajna-chakra – that is the one who is “panchajayi” [five-conquering]. That one can be said to be “sanjaya” (“saṃ” [with] + “jaya” [victory]). (See Chapter 1, slokas 1 and 21.) “Keshava” – “ke” = in water; and “shava” = dead body [corpse] – meaning: after dissolution, the One Who remains in repose in the water of dissolution, like a limitless corpse, as salt in salty water – the state in which the joy of creation – meaning: “arising-ness” – and the despondency of destruction – meaning: dissolution (the departure) are not there – the One Who is in this state – that is the One Who is called “Keshava” (see Chapter 10, sloka 14). When the sadhak comes down [from above] after having experienced the State of Keshava – the resulting intoxication from the mixing together of the memory of that previously experienced State of Keshava, the feelings of Keshava, as well as the consciousness of the current state – just that much is the experience of “hearing Keshava’s words.” “Kritanjali” [reverence with joined palms]: at this time, even if the attention is upward, there is no power to ascend. However, because the attention is upward, the downward movement is blocked as well. This conjunction of the two directions bringing about a stupefied state – this is that which is called “kritanjali.” “Vepaman” [trembling] – [the explanation follows]. The substances to be experienced are now present. At a time like this, before contact [with the substances], the inner trembling that comes about due to a weakness born of intense attachment – that is called the state of “vepaman.” “Kiriti” means dressing up the head. The consciousness of the sadhak who is still unperfected yet is full of tremendous enthusiasm in every way is “kiriti” – meaning: the sadhak who is at the head of every sadhak in deed and qualities – among the sadhaks, he/she is the one who is called “kiriti.” The mixing together of the vrittis [movements] of great joy, great sorrow, great fear, great astonishment, great affection, great enthusiasm and such – when they unite and try to come out from within – the choked speech that happens along with the eyes filling with tears – that is called “gadagada.” “Bheetabheetah pranamya” – when the above-mentioned states appear together in the heart – at that time, the sadhak becomes afraid again and again, fearing “oh I may lose everything I hold dear.” All of the bravado of one’s own ego disappears, and drooping down, one can no longer adhere to the [usual] force of vayu [vital-air] within. [At this time,] one draws and expels inhalations and exhalations that are beautiful, hindrance-free (easy) and long. The functionalities of the worldly experience completely end. And due to the presence of Divine Experiences, the movement of breath flows up and down exactly in the middle of the brahmanadi. That is called “pranam” [reverent bowing]. At this time, the love that spontaneously blossoms forth for the Bestower of Liberation – that is the bit that is hinted at as “speaking to Krishna.” In this state, no vritti [functionality] that is Mayic (reflected consciousness, samskaras [latent tendencies/impressions] born of previous karma [acts] and obligatory duties etc.) is able to come forth. Thus, Emancipation or Eternal Peace, born of the destruction of desires and the victory of sadhana, comes about inevitably. Because this firm knowing manifests, the statement “Sanjaya said” is made."
36,"Arjuna said: “O Hrishikesh [Sri Krishna]! The world sings of Your Glories in praise, joy and delight. The demons, in fear, are fleeing in all directions. And all realized beings are bowing in reverence. All of this is rightly so.”","Returning to his/her natural state, the sadhak, again remembering the previous experience, is saying within him/herself, “O Hrishikesh [Self]! That the world will be enamored with You upon seeing your supernatural Glories – of course it should be so. And on this path, I am seeing that the torturous, evil demons (enemies such as lust, anger etc.) are fleeing in fear in all directions. And it is as if the world is brimming over with ecstasy and delight. (When the sadhak experiences the seeing and remembering of the incredible vision in the state before the paravastha of Kriya [poise after Kriya] and the paravastha of the paravastha of Kriya [state after the paravastha of Kriya] – at that time, the sadhak becomes intoxicated in that Cosmic Bliss.) Those who have received the attainment of attainments – all of those great ones are looking at You with one focus, and via pranayam, have made ‘You-I’ as one, and are bowing to You. Lo! How absolutely true! And this happening is also very right. O Lord! How to sing Your praise – that I did not know before. But now I see that upturning the tongue and driving the prana in the anulom-vilom way from the Muladhar according to the proper method (that which makes ‘You-I’ One) – that this is actually the real singing of Your Glories.” "
37,"O Great Spirit! O Infinite One! O God of gods! O Abode of creation itself! You are bigger than even Brahmaa [creator principle] and are the Primordial Lord/Operator. Is it possible that everyone will not bow to You? You are Indestructible, and You are That which is beyond the existent and the non-existent (That Itself). ","The spider spreads out the web from within itself. Bugs, arachnids, mosquitos, flies [and such] fall into that web. Some escape; some die. And then the spider gathers in that [previously] spread out web into its own body. But there is a resting state before the spreading of the web and after the withdrawing of the web. I am seeing that the case of the progenitor of creation – Brahmaa – is the same. The resting state that is there before creation and after its dissolution – that is called “Hiranyagarbha” [the Golden Abyss; the Golden Womb]. Gold is the king of beauty. One can become entranced by gold when staring at its beauty. In the same way, the universe is filled with immense beauty; whatever you look at – that very thing entrances [you]. The one who, like the spider’s web, holds the universe in the womb/cavern within himself before creation and after dissolution – that is the one who is “Hiranyagarbha” or “Brahmaa.” This huge universe, the breadth of which the mind cannot even fathom – this very universe remains within Brahmaa’s belly. Think about it – how big Brahmaa’s form must be. At the time of rest, the One upon Whom even that Brahmaa rests, how big that resting place or that support of that Brahmaa is, and what It is – forget about mind and intellect [figuring it out] – it is even beyond the comprehension of that Brahmaa himself. Thus, He [the Lord] is “gareeyasa” – even bigger than Brahmaa. On a foundation, the emergence and existence of its tenants takes place (like the sweat-born, eggborn, seed-born and womb-born beings living on the Earth). Thus, the foundation is prior to the tenants and their creator/lord. Because he is the creator and the holder of the universe, the lord of the universe is Brahmaa [creator]. That is why the support/foundation [the Lord] of that Brahmaa has the name of “Devesha” [God of gods]. “Sat” = that which is “vidyaman” [present/known]; “asat” = that which is “avidyaman” [not present/unknown]; “akshara” = One Who cannot be destroyed, That Which cannot be exhausted. “tat” = That Vishnu’s Supreme Beingness; and “param” = Brahman. Dear sadhak! So, let us look at sadhana part; shall we?! “Vidyaman” – whatever there is that you know; “avidyaman” – whatever is not known by you – all of that remains in that Brahmaa and the golden place within his belly (meaning: within the universe and within the sheath of the universe – “Hiranyagarbha”). And that Foundation, for Whom there is not even a bit of change – on Whom everything is and is happening, yet He Who is devoid of diminution or perishing remains as He always Is – That is your One without a second – “tvam” [You]. Thus, that “tvam” is verily “Vasudeva” [the Omnipresent One]. That is why it is being said: “O Great Spirit! O Infinite One! O God of gods! O Abode of creation itself! When You are like this, then if I don’t bow to You, then whom else shall I bow to, Lord?”"
38,"O Infinite One! You are the Primal God and the Ancient Person. You are the place where this creation ends. (You verily are) the Knower, the Known and the Supreme Abode (State of Vishnu). All of creation is pervaded by You. ","Previously, the sadhak saw the Universal Form in the “place.” Now, the sadhak is seeing the “place” in the Universal Form. “TvamAdideva” [You are the Primal God] – O Lord! I see that You are Prior to even that which is first. Laying down in this city of Maya, You have taken on the name of “Purush” [Person]. Everything has an end. Only You are the Endless Eternal. You are the final place, or abode, of rest [resolution] for these names and forms. Whatever there is to be known – only You know all of that. And then again, whatever there is to be known is also You. O Infinite One! You are in this creation, and this creation is in You, like water and sugar in liquified sugar-water.

Salutations to You again, and over and over again, salutations to You.","“Vayu” means that which carries. O Lord! Whatever there is that has a beginning and end – You are holding that and carrying that on Your own Body. That is why You are “vayu.” You are “yama” as well (Chapter 9, sloka 29); You are “agni” too (Chapter 9, sloka 16); You are “varuna” as well (Chapter 10, sloka 29). The word “shash” means “reproachable” or “defect” (that which is to be discarded), and the word “anka” means “haunch” or “lap.” The light that is the Eternal Light, the permanence which is Eternity – the illusory vision that is had by placing the impermanent, non-illuminating Maya on the Lap of That [Eternal Light; Eternity] – that is the state of “shashanka.” This is also You. That is because everything is within You. “Prajapati” – the group of creators who create the lives in the world of living beings; they are the creators or fathers; because of them, the living beings are born – [prajapatis] such as Daksha, Kardam, Kashyap [mythological figures] etc. This is also You. Their father is Brahmaa [creator], that is why he is “pitamaha” [grandfather] and that is also You. That Brahmaa has arisen in the lotus from Your navel. That is why You are “prapitamaha” [great-grandfather]. Thus: O Father! O Mother! O Supporter! O Savior! Salutations to You! And I bow to You again and again!"

This is the process of doing “pranam.” This is a very high process in sadhana [spiritual practice]. This means: upon making the body straight and firm, it has to be thrown down. The meaning of “throwing down” is this: through the guru-instructed process, one has to rise above the five elements; right as one goes above, as mind and body separate from each other, and one thereby takes abidance in Chit [Knowingness], the “praNidhAya kAyam” [prostrating the “kaya” [see first line of this commentary]] happens. (This state/happening is known by oneself in sadhana [meditation].) Upon being settled in this state, through the aid of Atma-mantra, and by putting the mind adjoined with Nada-Jyoti into the Vishnu-ness, the happening of “prNamya praNidhAya kAyam” [bowing the “kaya” in a prostrated position] comes about. This Kriya is above the Ajnachakra; it is a mental Kriya devoid of body-identification. With this Kriya, God is pleased. — Begin Footnote. — That is why Lord Ashtavakra [a sage] has said: “yadi dehaṃ pṛthak kṛtya chiti vishrAmya tiShThasi; adhunaiva sukhee shAnto bandhamukte bhaviShyasi” [if consciousness is separated from the body and you abide in this repose, there will be great contentment and peace, and freedom from bondage]. — End Footnote. — The analogies/similes of making appeasement are of three ordinary types which are also natural [to a human being], such as: a friend to a friend with similar feelings; a lover to a lover, and the way the feelings are for the father in regard to the child. Just as there is no holding onto judgment regarding these wrongs, and just as forgiveness is ever there [in these relationships] – [I ask] You [to] please forgive all of my wrongs in the same way"
45,"O Lord! Seeing this previously unseen (Cosmic Form), I am delighted. But my mind/heart is unsettled with fear. Therefore, please just show me that [more pleasing] Form. O God of gods! O Abode of creation itself! Be appeased.","What I had never seen before – seeing that Form of Yours, I am ecstatic. But by falling into the torrential waves of this Form without having any previous connection, my mind/heart is unsettled with fear. O Abode of creation itself! Be pleased with me. Show me that shadowless, Radiant, Godly Form from before."
46,"I want to see You in that Form, with crown, mace/club, discus in hand. O thousand-armed Cosmic Form! Appear in that four-armed Form. ","O thousand-armed Cosmic Form! Subdue this Cosmic Form of Yours. The form that You showed as Yourself at the time of Your [human] birth, wearing a crown on Your head, and holding conch-shell, discus, mace/club and lotus, the four-armed Form that cast away the fear of Devaki and Vasudev [short “a”; Sri Krishna’s father], the Form that gave them security – show me today that fear-destroying, Peaceful Form and reassure my heart. I greatly desire to see that Form of Yours. "
47,"The Lord said: “O Arjuna. Being pleased, I revealed to you this Splendrous, Universal, Infinite, Primal and Supreme Form through My “Atma-yoga” [see commentary below], which no one other than you has previously seen.”","Again, the sadhak is resolving the previously seen “lilas” [sportings] through his/her own experience. O Arjuna! The manifestation of this incredible, living vision that you have just seen, from the perspective of a subject of the world of beings/planes – this happened because of My “prasannata” [being pleased] – (“pra” + “sad” = going + “ta”) – meaning: this is the definition of feeling something as one’s own. That experience of that and the repose that follows – that is called “prasannata” [being appeased]; this is because: for as long as there was any vritti [functionality] within the antahkarana [the whole mind] with the adjunct “mine,” for that long you could not make the space to see the play of that Incredible, Lifegiving Power. When you left your “I” and “mine” and fell into the True “I” – only then did that [cosmic] event of yours – previously unseen – take place. This is verily that which is called “Atma-yoga,” by which you saw that Primordial, Infinite, Supreme Form – meaning: the Form that is beyond all forms. There is not a single fragment of a particle of earth in any of That. It is simply the ultimate sport of the moving creation, light-filled and built on splendrous energy. When one ascends through the middle of the brahmanadi to the Sahasrar and pierces the light and merges the mind [in the Divinity], this state is experienced/known. The way that you saw this – it can only be seen by being in this way. If it is not so, no one else can have it."
48,"O Kurupraveera [Kuru hero; Arjuna]! Not by Vedic sacrifice nor [Vedic] study, not by charity, not by any Kriya[s], and not by intense austerities is anyone capable of seeing this Form in this human-world other than you. ","“Na vedaih” [not by the Vedas] – (the root “vid” means “knowledge”) – if one comes to the state of “Jnana” [Supreme Knowledge], this [cosmic event] cannot be seen, because at that time there is no existence of seen and seer. “Na yajnaih” [not by sacrificial fire] – for as long as there is taking and giving – for that long – meaning: if the functionality of giving and taking are there, this [cosmic experience] does not happen. “Na adhyayanaih” [not by study] – as long as there is the work of gathering up the intellect from its being spread about in sound, touch, sight, taste and smell, and returning it to its own place – for that long this cannot be seen. “Na dAnaih” [not by charity] – when the activity of letting go remains, even as a renunciate, this does not happen. “Na kriyAbhih” [not by Kriya] – for as long as one is able to drive prana according to guru’s instructions – even in that activity, this vision does not appear. “Na tapobhirugraih” [not by intense austerities] – for as long as there is this triune state of sweat, shaking and movement during the practice of Kriya, this bit does not happen. This Form of the Self reveals Itself to the sadhak right at the still point before the “I” merges into “I”. O Kuru hero, there is no second road leading to this."
49,"May you not be pained by seeing this terrifying Form of Mine, and may you not become confused either. Be free of fear and be happy at heart and see again That Form of Mine [previously seen before the terrifying Form]. ","“MA te vyathA” – do not fear any more. “MA cha vimooDhabhAvah” [do not be confused] – and you no longer need to go about being under the powers of lust, anger, serenity, perseverance and such. (Losing one’s sensibilities and taking recourse in lust, anger, delusion, discrimination/discernment, detachment and any such vrittis [operations] is “vimudhatva” [confusion].) So, do you see how it is to see My intense (allconsuming) Form? Now, see that Form [from before] – that four-armed Form holding conch-shell, discus, mace/club and lotus. What you desired to see – now see it. "
50,"Saying such to Arjuna, Vasudeva [long first “a”; Sri Krishna] again showed that Form [from before]. The Great Spirit (Sri Bhagavan [the Lord]) took on His Peaceful and Joyful Form and consoled the still afraid Arjuna. ","The word “vasu” [short “a”] means “gem,” such as diamond, emerald, pearl, ruby [etc.] – a thing that is inert, or not inert, within which light emits, yet that light is covered by something firm. “Deva” means “emitting light.” Thus the meaning is: something that is like an inert or non-inert substance from light is being emitted, but that light is seen through a firm yet transparent covering. That which emits light in this way – that is “vasudev” [short “a”]. And “Vasudeva” [long first “a”] means all gods – meaning: where all light-emitting, radiant beings reside together – this kind of place. “Jyotirabhyantare roopaṃ achintyaṃ shyamasundaram” [within the light is the unimaginable Form of the beautiful Dark One [Sri Krishna]]. When the sadhak looks to the upper side of the Ajnana-chakra – at that time, the sadhak sees “Vasudev” [short “a”] right in front. When that “Vasudev” is pierced, right then “Vasudeva” [long first “a”] is seen. Blending with His Own Prakriti and His Self (the Self is Beginning-less and Infinite; Prakriti is with beginning and with limits – the merging of these two) – the sadhak experiences a Form with beginning yet Infinite. There is no limit to this Beautiful Form. That is why the perfected sages have perceived a crown on the Head of this Infinite Form, expressing His Supremeness. That is why He is wearing a crown. Here [in this state] there is no physical aspect whatsoever, but the tanmatras [essences of manifestation] are there. A kind of unbroken sound – like the blending of “a” and “u” together – is experienced, as if it is being heard. That is why the sadhaks have compared it to the sound of a conchshell being blown into, and have stated that that is an aspect. (Investigators have stated that this world is only sound and is actually devoid of matter; matter is only an error in perception.) Whatever there is that has a beginning – that arises from one place, goes about [existing/functioning], and then again goes into repose at the place of its arising. Here too, the place from where experience itself begins, and, after going about in all directions, returns again to that same place and merges back – this aspect has been compared to a “chakra” [turning about; wheel; revolution; the discus in one of the hands of Vishnu]. Even though it is illusory, this creation is exceedingly beautiful to see. It blossoms from the Inexpressible, pretends to be expressible, and then disappears by merging back into the Inexpressible. That is why the poet-sages have compared the immaterial nature of creation as the “Sudarshan Chakra” [meaning: the turning about that is beautiful to see [“Sudarshan Chakra” is the name of the chakra/discus in the four-armed form of Vishnu]]. This Form has immense power to shock/astonish. Because it overwhelms one again and again, the Form is thought of as the experience of being “struck” by Power Itself, and that is why the name “gada” [mace/club] is shown as one of the aspects. There is nothing in the world but shocks. That is why the sages have used the code word “gada” [mace/club] for this aspect. “Padma” [lotus] – the word “pad” means “place”; the sound “ma” means Brahmaa [creator], Vishnu [preserver], Shiva [destroyer], Yama [death], Kaal [time] and Chandra [moon]. The place where all of these [represented by the sound “ma”] reside together – that is “padma.” This creation (it is like the magic show of creation, sustenance, usage, contraction and destruction) is keeping everyone entranced by the effect of its beauty/form. That is why the sages who know the science of phenomena have called this aspect “padma.” It has another name - “Pankaj” [born from dirt] – because it’s [the worldly beauty’s] birth is from dirt. That is why one aspect [of this four-armed Form], showing the visible beauty of creation, is represented by this “padma” [lotus]. These four have been conceived as happening on four sides – meaning: the four arms [of Vishnu]. Thus Vasudeva [the Lord] is pictured holding a conch-shell, discus, club and lotus, and wearing a crown. This means: the One Who is holding this false Maya-filled creation-samsara – He is Vasudeva. The Form of this Vasudeva is extremely mysterious and hidden. The blue that is seen on the sky because of great distance and error in vision, even though space is devoid of form/color – this Divine Form is even more mysterious than that. It is subtler than the subtlest. Whatever is experienced, known, intuited – It is even far away from that, immersed in the deep Unknown. For this reason, It has been given the name “Chikankaala” [Radiant Blackness; epithet of Sri Krishna]. “SAdhakAnAṃ hitArthAya brahmaNo roopakalpanA” [forms of Brahman are conceived for the benefit of the sadhak [aspirant]]. What this means is that there is no form whatsoever here. The experiences [of Divinity] are intense. As the sadhak starts to come down after continuously seeing Divine Visions, a kind of form is created according to those experiences while returning to samsara, relating the feelings that are experienced in Prakriti to the experiences in sadhana. This [Form of] “Vasudeva” is combination of all of those feelings. As mentioned in the earlier slokas, Arjuna was afraid. The Lord gave Arjuna consolation from that fear, and, by showing him that four-armed Form that was seen by the family of Vasudev [short “a”; Sri Krishna’s birth father] and revealing Himself again as the benevolent and beautiful (“totravetraikapANi” [helping-hand] friend), consoled Arjuna. This means: the fearlessness/assurance that the sadhak feels after first progressing in sadhana [spiritual practice] – that fearlessness/assurance turns to fear when one witnesses that Universal State after having progressed enough in sadhana. This is due to the weakness born of samskaras [previous worldly impressions] and attachments dwelling in the heart. But later, as one comes to know the State of Vasudeva [the Lord in pleasing Form], that fear disappears and one becomes reassured. And upon fully surrendering, the sadhak makes that State into a beautiful and benevolent form that can be held onto by his/her human antahkarana [personal consciousness]."
51,"Arjuna said: “O Janardan [Sri Krishna]! Seeing this beautiful human form of Yours, I am finally happy at heart and feel normal (I feel healthy).”","O Janaradan [the Lord; see 1:43 of the Pranab Gita]! Seeing this heart-enchanting human form of Yours, I am no longer stuck in that all-pervading Form. I am “prakritigata” [in Prakriti; normal] – meaning: I have blended back again with Prakriti. That which happens when being connected to physical consciousness – I have become that. Having returned to the covering of Prakriti, I have again become part of the mind’s dharma. At the time of the witnessing of the Universal Form, the jiva-ness [individual-ness] crosses beyond the sky of chitta [personal consciousness] and goes into the Sky of [Universal] Consciousness. All of the things that are seen in that state – there is no end to describing them. They are inexpressible – subjects which are beyond the grasp of the mind. Thus, the mind is not pleased. It does not find peace in that terrifying Form. It indeed becomes afraid. Later, when the Lord puts away His Universal Form and takes on His human form – at that time the fear goes away. The heart is pleased. This is because one becomes happy at seeing the Beneficent Lord’s Form in a way that is related to one’s own [human] form. Seeing the Form that is not related to one’s own [human] form causes one to be afraid. "
52,The Lord said: “This difficult-to-see Form of Mine that You have witnessed – the gods are constantly longing to see this Form.” ,"The sadhak, again rising back up to the Consciousness of the Self, is resolving the previous experiences. This Incredible Form of Mine, That Which can only be seen after intense sadhana [spiritual practice] – I have seen that the gods (the luminous, subtle-body endowed consumers of karmic fruits are called “devatas” [gods; demi-gods]) constantly long to see that Form. If one does not have the waking-state in a physical body along with rajoguna, sadhana does not happen. The gods lack these. That is why they cannot do sadhana. And without doing sadhana, there is absolutely no way of seeing that Incredible Form. "
53,"The way that you have seen Me – not through the study of the aggregate of the Vedas, not by austerities, not by giving and not by ritual sacrifice are others able to see Me in this way.","This “I” – even if the recitation of Sama-Rik-YajurAtharva [Vedas] is mastered, that “I” is not seen. Doing austere practices like emaciating the body and such, holding oneself upside down and such also cannot bring about the witnessing of that “I”. The ritual sacrifices such oblations in fire and such also cannot bring about the witnessing of that “I”. Even if one gives away the whole Earth with all of the oceans, there is no way that one can see the “I” by doing that. The way that I have seen that “I” – one has to see the “I” in exactly that way. There is no second path."
54,"O Parantapa Arjuna! Only through single-minded devotion can I – revealing Myself in this Form of the Supreme Goal – be known, seen and [only through single-minded devotion] can one enter Me.","The sadhak that has the ability to have power over even Parashakti [ruling power in creation] due to his/her sadhana – that is the sadhak who is called “Parantapa” [one who has power over even the ruling power]. To perform Kriya without breaking off of the practice and doing it with unwavering faith in guru’s teachings is that which is called “ananyabhakti” [single-minded devotion]. Only through this single-minded devotion can this Universal I-Substance (meaning: “I”) be known element by element – can be understood – meaning: progressively rising up through the earth-element, liquid-element, fire-element, air-element, space-element etc. – gradually rising up, the awareness/understanding of that kind of Form of the Self comes forth (this is that which is called “karma-kanda” [action phase] of sadhana [spiritual practice]). Later, It is realized [is real] – meaning: the Universal Form is directly seen. (This is that which is called “upasana-kanda” [the phase of experiential worship of the Lord’s Glories].) After this, one enters into that Universal Form – meaning: upon continuously looking at that Form, one loses oneself and merges with That; Liberation is attained. (This is that which is called “jnana-kanda” [the phase of Supreme Knowledge/Awareness].) Therefore, without “bhakti” [devotion], there is no “mukti” [Liberation]. The process of doing bhaktisadhana [devotion-practice] is being stated in this sloka. First, [there is] single-minded devotion – meaning: having become enthusiastic about spirituality, one does the performance of the Kriya of the Self according to the teachings of guru; later [there is] direct knowledge by oneself; and later [there is] the attainment of Liberation. Thus, it is now understood that the beginning phase of spiritual practice is devotion, the middle phase is Knowledge, and the final state is Liberation. That is why it is said, “devotion is itself Liberation” – “bhaktimuktireva sunischita” [it is absolutely certain that devotion is verily Liberation]. "
{55}{stop},"O Pandava [Arjuna]. The one who performs acts dedicated to Me, the one to whom verily I am the Supreme Divine Goal, the one who is My devotee, who has abandoned all attachment, and is devoid of enmity towards any beings – that being is the one who attains Me. ","[The kinds of character and behavior that bring about the attainment of “I” – that bring about Liberation – for the God-longing aspirants – the Lord is bestowing that very teaching in a condensed way in the Gita, the essence of all scriptures.] Therefore, O Arjuna! The one who drives prana in the path/way shown through guru’s teachings, the one who puts oneself into that “I”, the one who keeps that “I” in front of oneself and tries to merge with that “I”, the one who has absolutely no other desire at all, the one for whom there is no conflict with any beings/phenomena because of the guna-attached beings/phenomena being unable to bring forth any troubles to that one – that being is the one who attains this “I” – becomes “I”.
