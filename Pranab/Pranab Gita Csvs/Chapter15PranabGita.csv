1,"The ashvattha tree [a type of fig tree, considered sacred in India] with its roots on top, and the branches below is called “avyaya” [indestructible; inexhaustible], all of the metric rhymes of which are the leaves. The one who knows that ashvattha tree – that is the one who is knowledgeable about the meaning of the Vedas.","The statement in Chapter 14, sloka 27 [of the Bhagavad Gita] that was made – “brahmaNo hi pratiShThAham” [I AM the Foundation of Brahman] – how is that “I”? Dressing up this body as the ashvattha tree [a type of fig tree, considered sacred in India] – so that the jiva [embodied soul], with its very limited intelligence, can quickly grasp the [meaning of the] word “I” – that effort is being made within the consciousness of self-knowledge and self-enquiry.
 
Samsara [life in the world as a whole] is like a tree. It is full of embodied living beings. That is why samsara is called “jiva-jagat” [the world of embodied living beings]. The Avyakta [non-apparent source], Brahman’s Maya-power, is the root cause of samsara. The expanse of the work [of Maya], beginning from this root cause, has become Mahat-tattva, ego, tanmatras [source of the senses] etc. – the different branches of this work. These are the presiding places of gods, demons, celestial musicians, half-gods, humans, animals, birds, creepers, flying insects – different types of living beings. Thus, the places of the branches of the tree of living beings in samsara are in “Hiranyagarbha” [golden womb] and such. The upper/higher place in the body for all of these living beings is the head. The brahmarandhra in that head is the abode of that Maya-endowed Brahman. It is from that that the expanse of the work [of Maya] has transformed into: categories of Mahat-tattva, ego, tanmatras etc.; and with the process of the 24 substances, the seven heavens and the seven netherworlds together; as well as the particular physical forms of hands/arms, feet, fingers [and such] – [all] as branches spreading out in the downward direction. It is for this reason that samsara (the body of the living being) is said to have the root up above and the branches below. The jiva [embodied being] inevitably will end. It is alive today, will it be alive tomorrow? No, there is nothing certain about it. That is why samsara is called “ashvattha” ([meaning:] that which has no possibility of settledness until the next dawn) – meaning: destroyable in a [or: any] moment. As the body of this jiva is bound to continual destruction, that inevitable end continues to happen. It has no end, no diminution. It is like the current of the river. Some water comes into the river; right then it goes towards the sea. And in its place, right then some more water comes in. That also goes. And again more water comes. In this way, due to the nonstop coming and going of water, the flow of the river (current) just does not end. One bit of water does not stay in one place, that is true, but the water of the river in the form of the current has become unending, non-diminishing, and does not empty out. In the world of jivas, the current of jivas is like that – unending, non-diminishing, and does not empty out. That is why this samsara is called “avyaya” [non-diminishing]. The metric rhymes are like the leaves of this tree. The metric rhymes are “Veda” – meaning: the operations of whatever is “known.” The matters of this “knowing” are two: karma [acts] and jnana [knowledge/wisdom]. The creation, which is the emergence of the state of being of phenomena or of a living being, is called “karma” (see Chapter 8 of Bhagavad Gita) – meaning: with the outgoing and incoming processes of the 24 substances, inside and outside, all of the mixed and unmixed operations that can take place – all of that is “karma” [activity as a whole]. This karma is that which is “vijnana” [knowledge at work]. And knowing the nature and relationship of Prakritic substances and the Substance of the Self is “jnana” [spiritual knowledge]. That by which this karma and jnana can be known – that is that which is “Veda.” The matters of the Vedas are of the three gunas, and they are divided into Rik, Yaju, Sama and Atharva – these four parts. (See the commentary to Chapter 2, sloka 45 [of the Pranab Gita].) Samsara is covered with the tri-guna-filled karma and jnana of the Vedas. That is why the Vedas are like the leaves of the tree of samsara. The leaves bring beauty to the tree, and display the aliveness of that being [in this case: the tree]. Karma and jnana, in the same way, bring beauty to samsara, and show the aliveness of the embodied being. The leaves protect the tree and bring shade. Living beings suffering from the heat of the sun get relief/peace upon coming to that shade, but the covering of the leaves [while one is in the shade], covers up the mind/heart-intoxicating, deep blue of the great sky, the infinitely expansive, immaculate glory. The Vedas too, in the form of the shade of karma and jnana, keep the existence of samsara going, and the jiva, upon coming to the refuge of that karma and jnana, gets relief/peace from the suffering of the three pressures. But, because the Vedas are of the matters of the three gunas – if one stays in the refuge of the Vedas, one cannot have the completely Pure Bliss of the non-tri-guna-state. The mind/heart and life do not merge into the Infinite, Inexhaustible Glory. One has to remain with the three gunas, under Prakritic control, losing oneself in the operations of jnana and karma. The one who, through the grace of sadguru, has attained the Knowledge of the Self, and through the vision of Knowledge, knows the tree of samsara (the body), with its root, branches and leaves, in the aforementioned way – if one truly sees/understands it – that one is the knower of the meaning of the Vedas. — Begin Footnote. — God Himself is the Knower of the Vedas. This is known because later, in sloka 15 [of this Chapter 15 of the Bhagavad Gita] there is [the statement] “vedavideva cAham” [I am the knower of the Vedas as well]. But, the sadhak too – just as he/she attains the state of “knower of the field” through spiritual progress – in the same way, he/she becomes the knower of the Vedas. (See footnote on page 217. [This reference to page 217 is written in the original; however, there is no such reference in page 217 of the copy of the Pranab Gita used by the translators; it is possible that the author meant the first footnote to sloka 39 of Chapter 3.] — End Footnote. —"
2,"The branches of that samsara-tree are all spread out in the downward and upward directions; they grow due to the three gunas, and the root also grows out in all of the downward directions, and it binds the world of humans in karma [actions and their fruits] (meaning: it is the progenitor of the karmas [acts] of righteousness and unrighteousness).","Those lower branches such as hands, feet etc. that have been spoken about in the previous sloka – these have been spoken about in regards to the powers of doing karmas [actions]. The karmas are of two types – good and bad. The good ones take the way upward and the bad ones take the way downward. Those who take the good way – they, going gradually upward from Muladhar, bring the creation-doing power of this world under their own control, receive unimpeded directives and dress up as Brahmaa [the creator]. The fundamental driving force in this is “yogakanksha” [the longing for yoga]. And those who take the downward direction – they, going downward from the Ajna, become [entities] from humans [down] to inert matter in the downward areas. This becoming – this is due to the power of the three gunas – sattva, rajas and tamas. The foundation of this is “bhogakanksha” [the longing for enjoyments], the fortifying of the embedded desires. The particular worldly experience that is had is according to whichever guna is dominating. Dear sadhak, that sound-touch-sight-taste-smell that you are enjoying outside – these are also “vishaya” [the worldly experience]. And again, when you take recourse in the brahmanadi within the sushumna and go to merge into the guru-substance [or: the great substance] in the Sahasrar – in that brahmanadi too, you have to experience sound-touch-sight-taste-smell. The “vishaya/s” [experience/s] in the brahmanadi, through Brahman-Knowledge, make one be merged in Brahman; and the ones on the outside take recourse in the kinds of atomic substances that bind one to karma [actions and their fruits] and make one experience states of being from the human down to even the lowest hell."
"03,04","So that that kind of form (the type with the root up above and such) of the tree of samsara does not become manifested – not its end, not its beginning, not its staying, this ashvattha [see 15:1 of the Pranab Gita], with its extremely dense and binding root, must be fully cut down with the axe of non-attachment. And the “thing” that will ensure that the spiritual travelers do not ever again return [to this tree of samsara] – that “thing” has to be taken up. The One from Whom this endless, outwardly going samsara has spread out – I take refuge in that Primal Person (one has to take up [the spiritual practice] with one-pointed devotion in this way).","This imaginary samsara representing ashvattha tree [see 15:1 of the Pranab Gita] that has been made up – this is as unreal as a city in the sky that is made up of clouds. Even after the destruction of the city as the clouds change, the picture of the city that was previously seen has been taken in by the antahkarana [personal consciousness]. Just as that picture cannot again be erased, and that long afterwards, as needed, through the help of memory in the antahkarana, that city is shown again in oneself, yet at that time there is no remnant of that city present in front of the eyes outside the body, that it is the play of mind, that all of it being seen in the mind by the mind – in the same way, that imaginary ashvattha tree of samsara has no form at all. It is just imagined by the imagination. Thus, its beginning, end and middle cannot be found. That which does not exist at all, what can be its middle and end? Thus, this ashvattha tree has been made up because the antahkarana has taken on the imprint of that mentally-made tree. At some other time, whether it is in this lifetime, or after a hundred [after a long time], at sometime or another, this memory will be made to rise up again. The more the days pass, the more this imagined field in the antahkarana will become deeper and deeper. And according to that, its power will also grow. Through intense practice, and with the help of “para vairagya” [higher detachment], as one continually [and willingly] does not pay attention [to this samsara], when no desire arises to be with this samsara in the waking or dream or even the deep sleep state – it is only then that that firmly-rooted imaginary memory will be cut down/cut away. The method to cut down/cut away that memory is verily that detachment or non-attention [to that memory].
 
This “para vairagya” [see above paragraph] begins from the top of the Ajna-chakra. Dear sadhak! Take a look. All of the play of samsara exists until the Ajna-chakra. Now you have risen above the Ajna-chakra. Now you are non-doing. Now see: your physical, subtle and causal bodies are not there. And you are not an embryo in the womb of Prakriti. Like when a drop of oil falls on deep and endless body of water, that the particles of oil run so that they can cover the surface of all of the water – similar to that – see how you are now merging with the Infinite Expanse. Look now – what an incredibly beautiful Light is in front of you, even more beautiful than the glow of pure quicksilver. That Light is not something different [from you]. The Light is coming forth from you, verily, and is running as a current behind you. The Light has no boundaries. Where It is coming from – you yourself do not want to say. Know that you are going towards being an unexplainable boundlessness, which is well-witnessed, deep, full, profound, new, incomprehensible, beyond knowledge and analysis. That Boundlessness is the Form of Vishnu. “Vishnu” means the all-pervading Consciousness-Self. And becoming that Boundlessness is the “Vaishnavi Marg” [the path of a “Vaishnava” [devotee of Vishnu]; or: the path of Vishnu]. Because you are merging in Vishnu and are taking on that Vishnu-ness, you are “Vaishnava.” The one who worships Vishnu – that is the one who is “Vaishnava.” Now see another wonderful glory! From below this ever-new depth of Concentrated Consciousness, the revelatory light of Mahat is blazing forth. The union of Prakriti and Purush – right now you are just at its junction-point. See it fully, and understand it. As much as that light [of Mahat] comes to you, that much does it make the essence of its partner blossom. What incredible beauty! The coming together of light and dark! The current-flow that is going in the opposite direction – as that is the creation-facing vritti [active force] (pravritti [outward-directed active force]), it is the offspring of Maya. And your taking on nivritti [inward-directed active force; withdrawal] and came upward out of samsara – this is that current’s “dakshina” [right-hand; southern] flow. That is why this direction of the flow is called “Radha” [Krishna’s beloved; the beloved of the Lord]. The opposite to the [downward] flow is verily “Radha.”
 
[Bengali couplet]
 
“brahma hote sristhtimukhi drishti dhara ‘bandha’
srishti hote brahmamukhi ta’re boli ‘radha’”
 
[The perception and flow in the direction of creation from Brahman is “bandha” [bondage]. The [flow] that is in the direction of Brahman from creation is called “Radha” [Krishna’s beloved; the beloved of the Lord].]
 
And this [upward] flow comes and merges with you and becomes “I”; this is indeed Krishna. That is why the sages have said: “vAme taDitachArvangee rAdhA dakshe sushyAmalam; kṛShNaṃ kamalapAtrakshaṃ rAdhAkṛShNaṃ bhajAmahyam” [on the left, the lightning-formed Radha; on the right the Beautiful Dark One; the Lotus-Eyed Krishna – I worship Radha-Krishna]. This State – this, which is the “I” State – when one comes into this “I” – meaning: upon expelling the last breath from the body, which is of samsara, if one reaches this “I”, there is no returning to samsara. You are this Beginning-less Person – “I”, the “I” from which – look and see – that Ancient Mahamaya is giving birth to pravritti [outward life]. It is this path that is appropriate for the sincerely longing sadhaks [spiritual aspirants].

— Begin Added Section. — The Purush form of Brahman (of the Self) is called “urdhva” [up], and the form of Prakriti is called “adhah” [down]. The mantra-seeing sages see the form of Purush and the form of Prakriti as two bindus sitting above and below[, respectively]. The bindu above is the Sat-Chit-Ananda-filled Brahman-bindu, and the bindu below is the sattva-rajas-tamas-filled Prakriti-bindu. With the wish to go outward, the wholeness of Prakriti takes on separateness with the three gunas. In that, Prakriti divides into three, according to the three gunas, with the knowledge-endowed “naad-shakti” for sattva guna (mark goes here), the action-endowed or desire-endowed “bindu-shakti” for rajoguna (mark goes here), and the “kalaa-shakti” for the delusion-endowed tamoguna (mark goes here), and takes on three forms with the three names. Then, that “naad” (mark goes here), “bindu” (mark goes here) and “kalaa” (mark goes here), being below Brahman-bindu (residing in the lower area), and being in contact with it [or: that; it is unclear as to what “it” or possibly “that” refers], takes on the forms of the three letters, respectively: “anusvara” (Sanskrit letter goes here), “visarga” (Sanskrit letter goes here) and “chandrabindu” (Sanskrit letter goes here). The Consciousness-Purush, being reflected in these, takes on the forms of the presiding gods of three letters with the names of, respectively: Vishnu, Brahmaa and Rudra. Those three letters are the Primal Person’s (Brahman’s) letters-endowed three forms, [respectively] named “urdhvalinga,” “virupaksha” and “vishwaroopa.”
 
Prakriti is the Avyakta Omkar-form. That Omkar is that which is called the “world” or the form of the “universe.” “Bindu” is the extremely subtle beginning of the blossoming of the Omkar. That is the Anahata Sound. “Naad” [sound] is the blossomed state of Omkar. That is “dhvani” [resonance] (“sur” [tone; melody] or “jhankar” [resonating sound]). And “kalaa” is the fully revealed state of Omkar. That is the “dhvani”-enjoined light. Due to the pull of pravritti, “kalaa” becomes enjoined to rajo-tamas guna and is seen as an unclear moonlight covered by fine, smokey-dark clouds. And with the pull of nivritti and thus becoming enjoined to sattva guna, [kalaa is seen as] the comely, luminous, enchanting, white moonlight. It is in that white light that the mind attains dissolution [merging]. That is why, in sloka 1:423 of the Uttara Gita it is said: “anahatasya shabdasya tasya shabdasya yo dhvanih; dhvanirgataṃ jyoti jyotiranrgata manah; tanmanye vilayaṃ yAti tadviShNoh pramaṃ padam [in the anahata sound, dhvani; in dhvani, light; mind goes in the light; mind becomes absorbed and dissolves in the Supreme Vishnu-Substance].” In the path of pravritti, “kalaa” makes the jiva universe-formed, ties it in the bindings of embedded desires, and makes it go round and round endlessly in the current of birth and death. But, in the path of nivritti, that very “kalaa” becomes “prasanna” [appeased] (becomes the sattva-filled, still, white light), makes the jiva be free of desires, gives it the Form of Brahman, takes it beyond the enclosing perimeter of death, and makes it be victorious over death. That is why the nivritti-endowed, great yogi Shiva, witnessing “kalaa” in the Shiva-netra [Shiva-eye] at all times, attained the state of being victorious over death.

The progression of the manifestations of the three forms of that state of “krishnapingala” and “urdhvalinga” and such, and their descriptions, are as follows.
 
(1) “Krishnapingala” – at first, due to being under the power of the developing of the gunas in the pravritti-shakti, two conditions – “krishna” [dark-form] and “pingala” [yellow-form] – blossom in the Primal Person. On His right side, the essence-part, the dark-form is had, and on His left side, the shakti-part, the yellow-form is had. That dark state is attraction, the “non-doing” masculine state, and the yellow state is the attractive, active power, the “doing” feminine state. In this way, together in one place, with the meeting of “non-doing” and “doing,” male and female, with both being next to each other, a condition of “Ardhanareeshvara” [Divinity as half-male and half-female] blossoms forth. That is why His name is “Krishnapingala.” This state of His is also non-apparent, beyond the senses.
 
(2) “Urdhvalinga” – after the blossoming of the “krishnapingala” condition, the wish to go outward grows in that Primal Person. Then, directed by ego-identification/ego-vanity, in order to create the world, takes on a form of linga, becoming the root cause, or causal reason for creation, done by uniting with the knowledge-endowed Shakti of Prakriti. Because it is upward-directed, that linga-form is called “urdhvalinga” [upward linga], Brahman-linga or “punglinga” [male-linga].
 
Creation does not happen only with the [operation of] causal reason in the form of “urdhvalinga.” There has to be a causal space or a causal receiver. That causal receiver is His “things-knowledge-operator” Prakriti. But even though that Prakriti of His is experienced, until that time, She has not become “visargita” [fully separate] (created as exclusively separate) from Him. She stays One with Him, and She Herself is in the upward form and identifies Her “I” with the Brahman-Purush.
 
He is the all-pervading Self. Even after taking the form of linga, He is still Inexpressible. In the form of linga, he is in the Causal Body, the seed-mantra connected with “anusvara” [see previously mentioned Sanskrit letters in this added section]. It is in the form that he becomes the seed of the cosmos, and because he is now the self that identifies with the knowingness-endowed causal body, he is known as “praajna” [knowing function].
 
(3) “virupaksha” – upon the Primal Person taking on the form of “urdhvalinga” – then the desire of Prakriti springs forth even more (it grows and spreads), and Prakriti abandons her own causal state and takes on an extremely subtle form beyond the senses. Then the Primal Person, due to that desire, makes himself “visargita” [created more] – meaning: he takes his shaktis (the many forms of Prakriti below) from the upward state (from the state of Brahman or the masculine state), separates them like the double-bindu “visarga” [see previously mentioned Sanskrit letters] (Sanskrit letter goes here). This is that which is his “visarga” [individuated] creation or creation with particular identities of Prakriti. This particular aspect is his energy-filled “aksha” (things, knowledge, operation-endowed senses) – meaning: material cause. That is also “virupa” – meaning: without form, non-apparent, beyond the senses. Just as He is Avyakta Purush, similarly His Shakti separates and becomes Avyakta Prakriti. This Avyakta Prakriti is verily the material cause of His creation – “adholinga,” “prakritilinga,” or “strilinga” (the yoni of the cosmos).
 
Because this separated, material form of Prakriti (senses) is “virupa” (without form – non-apparent), he/she is “virupaksha” – meaning: the dual-form of the non-apparent Purush-Prakriti. Taking on this dual-form of “virupaksha,” he/she becomes “me/mine-oriented.” This energy-filled, subtle “jnanaroopatilalasa” [desirous-consciousness-form] Prakriti is the one who builds his/her subtle body. And becomes this energy-filled, subtle-body-oriented self, he/she becomes known as “taijas.”
 
(4) “Vishwaroopa” – the one whose form is the cosmos, that is the one who is “vishwaroopa.” The limited and changing Avyakta Prakriti, transformed by the operations of the three gunas into the seven mutations and the twenty-four substances, manifests itself as the physical form, and also makes the Inexpressible Primal Person become formed through manifesting in a physical form built from the aforementioned substances. That physical form is that which becomes his physical body. In that the created things such as the seven heavens, seven hells etc., and such aspects of the universe come together. Then he becomes “me/mine-oriented” in that physical body, and becomes known as the “vishwa” [cosmos/universe], and because he manifests in the “roopa” [form] of that “vishwa” [cosmos] his name is “vishwaroopa.”
 
Just as Avyakta Prakriti in her pravritti-mode dresses up the Primal Person in the covering of Maya in the previously mentioned way, similarly, in the nivritii-mode, she removes the dress of Maya and returns him to the Form of Brahman. Because the tri-guna[-endowed] Avyakta Prakriti must end, whatever she manifests, she again merges it back to Avyakta. This is the activity of the three gunas – the game of creation, preservation, dissolution.
 
There are two states of the creator Brahmaa called “ahah” and “ratri.” In Chapter 8, sloka 18 of the Bhagavad Gita, it is stated that all of the universes that are manifested (created) during Brahmaa’s “aharagam” – meaning: when it is his “day” – all of that, during “ratragam” – meaning when it is his “night,” is dissolved, and does not last until the next “day.” They are not permanent. That is why the universe is named “ashvattha.” “Ashvattha” – not lasting until “shva” (the next day) – impermanent. Only Brahman is permanent. Everything other than That is impermanent. In scriptures, the Permanent is called “Eternal Truth,” and the impermanent is called “non-eternal/temporal truth” or “false.”
 
This universe-tree named “ashvattha” is with the root up above and the branches below. This is verily the “Virat Moorti” [great form] of the Primal Person. It is from this that the many universes are created, that there is the emergence of gods, humans and many such living beings. From the “I” of this “Virat Purush” form, the creation, preservation and destruction are taking place of many living beings identified with small “I”s. This is that which is “samsara” – the endless current of creation-preservation-destruction. This is flowing endlessly. That is why the other name for the universe-tree is “samsara-vriksha” [samsara-tree], and because it is endless, it is “avyaya” [inexhaustible].
 
The body of the jiva [living being] is [in] three forms – the causal body, the subtle body and the physical body. The causal body of the jiva is “chinmaya” [knowing-filled]. Just as the Consciousness-Essence is the Chaitanya Purush – in the same way, the knowing-power is the Chaitanya Prakriti or Maya. Because it is formed by the ignorant-part of that knowing-power-formed Maya, the “chinmaya” causal body of the jiva is ignorance-rooted, and that is the cause of the jiva’s “jiva-ness” or its seed. It is in that chinmaya causal body that the jiva’s subtle body and physical body, like a tree with the root and branches together, grow. That is why the body of the jiva follows the dharma of the tree. That is why the two bodies (subtle and physical bodies) that are the coverings of the chinmaya causal body form and grow similar to a tree. Among those two bodies, the subtle body is power-filled, and the physical body is the operational instrument of that power. To the human being, his/her own body is itself the universe-tree, the samsara-tree or the world.
 
The body of the human being too is with the root up above and the branches below. The one who knows this tri-substanced body – that one is “vedavit” [knower of knowledge], and that one, knowing the True Form of the Self beyond the body (the Self of the jiva, or his/her own Self), becomes free of vanity/me-identification and free of delusion, surrenders him/herself, and becomes competent for the discipline of finding out the “That-substance.” The process of the human body’s emergence, and its description is in the last part of the [section called] “Practice of Sadhana” in the Introduction [to the Pranab Gita]. That should be read."
5,"Those who have become free of “maan” [ordinary meaning: repute; see commentary below for inner meaning] and delusion, those who have overcome the errors of attachment to the forms of sons and such, those who are engaged in the discussion of the Supreme Self, those whose desires have fully been withdrawn, those who have become free of the conflicts named pleasure and pain – they become “amudha” [non-ignorant] (meaning: free of ignorance) and attain that Non-diminishing State.","“Kriyayorantaraṃ yuktavishrAmo mAnamuchyate” [the resting time between two accomplishments is called “maana” [contentment in the accomplishment]]– one thing is accomplished; there is the hope of another – the resting that happens between these two is that which is called “maan.” And the repose that is there at the end of all of the operations of the cosmos-creation – that is that which is called “nirmaan” [beyond “maan”].
 
The absorption in ignorance that is there because of placing “I-ness” in anything other than “I” - that is called “moha” [delusion]. “Mama mAtA, mama pitA, mameyaṃ gṛhiNe gṛhaṃ etadanyAṃ mamatvaṃ yat sa moha iti keertitah” [my mother, my father, my spouse and my house too – this “my-ness” towards others results in “moha” [delusion]]. And abiding in the True “I” is called “nirmoha” [beyond delusion; non-delusion].
 
The desire to associate/unite with something/someone other than “I” is called “sangadosha” [error of association]. The settled state that is there after totally erasing this desire from the inner being is that which is called “jitasangadosha” [victorious over the error of association].
 
When the mind leaves everything and remains absorbed in only the Self – that state is called “adhyatmanitya” [always in the knowledge of Spirit].
 
The lust to get something other than “I” is called “kama.” And the Settledness in Brahman that is there after all desires of “having” are extinguished – that is verily the state of “vinivrittakama” [fully departed from lust].
 
Two things opposing each other is called “dvandva” [conflict], like: cold and heat, pleasure and pain, attachment and repulsion etc. The full withdrawal from this is called the state of “dvanda vimukti” [being completely free of “dvandva”].
 
When all of these [negative] states are gone, one becomes “amudha” [non-ignorant]. And that “amudha” is the one who attains the Non-diminishing “That.”
"
6,"That Substance cannot be revealed by the sun, cannot be revealed by the moon, nor can fire reveal It. Going where (yogis) do not again return – that verily is My “Param Dham” [Supreme Abode] (My Being).","Even being the great grouping of light that it is, the sun cannot reveal this “That-Substance” by its own light, nor can the moon, nor can fire. This is because none of these have the power to reach that “That-Substance.” But this Vishnu-Substance, through the effect of Its own Light, reveals those three luminescences. When this “That-Vishnu” Supreme Substance is attained, there is no return to samsara. This Substance/State is verily the “Param Dham” [Supreme Abode] of “I” (the place of Rest)."
7,"Verily, My Fragments become all of the living beings in the world of living beings and attract the Prakriti-residing mind and the five senses such as sound etc.","The coming and going of the jiva [living being] is endlessly happening. Then why would the jiva not return after going to the Supreme Abode? In order to explain this statement, the Lord is saying that the jiva is actually a part of Me. It takes on the state of separateness due to My Maya-delusion. For as long as there is the delusion of Maya, for that long does the coming and going go on. If the root of the Maya-delusion is cut apart by the weapon of non-attachment, the state of separateness ends. My fragment becomes one with Me, and no “going about” remains.
 
This state can be explained by certain examples.
 
Just as the one effulgence of the sun becomes innumerable suns when it reflects on the waves of water – in the same way, the One Supreme Self, because of reflecting on the Prakritic waves, has become the creation of these innumerable living beings.  Just as that sun in the water dances due to being under the power of the water – similarly, the jiva, being under the power of Prakriti, becomes enjoined to the six – the mind and the [five] senses together – and goes on doing activity. And then when the waves of the water cease, the many reflections on the bubbles disappear; and when the water dries up, the reflection of the sun disappears into the sun, and does not come back again. In the same way, when the Prakritic waves end, the jiva’s state of multiplicity disappears, and a state of One comes forth. And with the dissolution of Prakriti, that reflection that is the form of the jiva, mixes back in with that Supreme Self, and never returns again.
 
That which is the Division-free Great – how can It have a “part”? You are “Only-Rama.” But when you dress up as Hanuman in the theater of Rama, then, just like your friends who see you do not take in your “Only-Rama-ness” into their antahkarana [mind as a whole] but enjoy you as Hanuman and Hanuman’s seeing, hearing, speaking [etc.], and you [too] enjoy that – this is like that. Just as when walls are broken down and the feeling of divided space in a room goes away and one great space is known – it is like that. I Am Indivisible; I Am like that forever. The gunas [primal qualities] of Prakriti are three. By mixing with the organs of perception and mind, they are showing many forms like that of the rainbow in “I”. Thus, the carnival of jivas is the Indivisible “I” dressed up as differences. A little while ago you were “I”, and now again that “you” became “I”, yet there is not even a scintilla of change. Now understand this, what else?"
8,"When “Ishvara” ([as] jiva [the person], the lord of the body) takes on the body and leaves the body – at that time, like taking along the perfume blown by the wind from flowers and such, he takes the senses, with the mind as the sixth, with him.","Where the flower is, I do not know. But just as the wind takes the flower’s scent, brings it, fills the nose and enchants – in the same way, when one body dies, “Ishvara,” the presiding ruler of the body and senses and such – or the jiva [individual soul] – carries, along with the mass of karma [actions and their fruits] that has been done by that body, those three gunas, the senses and the mind, and enters [or: takes on] another body."
9,"This one (jiva), taking recourse in ears, eyes, skin, tongue and nose, and mind, takes in the worldly experience.","Dear sadhak! Put your attention into your “you” that was in the previous bound state, and look one more time. The new body you took on after leaving the body that was cast off – in this, nothing of your “you-ness” changed. As well, there is no change in Prakriti, the mutations of Prakriti or the gunas. The change is only in the “tri” and “panchikaran” [Vedantic perceptions on the change from subtle elements to matter]. The stronger the “karan” [doing- or engagement-oriented modalities] are, the more do you become intoxicated by the deep embrace of ignorance. Look there, in the new body, with new strength, how much more than before the mind is now energetically enjoying the worldly experience by taking recourse to the powerful ears, eyes, nose, tongue and skin. Taking recourse in the senses of hearing, seeing, touching, tasting and smelling – how does the mind experience all of these worldly experiences of sound, touch, sight, taste and smell? It is like the tangled hair of a little boy. Just as, after slowly taking out the dirt from the tangles, the hair stays just as it was and no diminution or growth happens to the hair – for you it is the same. If the Prakritic operations are removed, you are the same Unbound that you ever are."
10,"At the time of death, the being who leaves the body, or the one who is in the body, or the one who is engaged in the enjoyment of the worldly experience, or the embodied one who is endowed with gunas (connected to the senses and such) – the ignorant ones cannot see that one. Only the persons who have the eye of knowledge can see [that being]. ","This exiting from the body by the guna-endowed jiva at the time of death, the residing in the body and the enjoyment of the worldly experience – the ignorant ones (those caught up in enjoyments/partaking) cannot see that. Those whose sight of the eye of knowledge has opened – they are the ones who see. You are the witness of that."
11,The endeavoring yogis are the ones who can see the residing Self in the body. But a person of impure heart and persons of wrongful ways cannot see It (the Self) even if they endeavor.,"This casting off of the body, the taking up of a body, the staying and the enjoying of the worldly experience –  through their endeavor (sadhana) yogis see this while abiding in the Self by themselves. But the dogmatic non-discriminating ones (those who do not do [spiritual practice]) – even if they tear their hairs out from the head and die – cannot see [this]. This means: those whose personal consciousness has not been purified, and thus the perspective is also not settled – even if they take all the care to make effort according to the scriptural texts and such – because their inner sight has not opened, they cannot see anything of the subtler than the subtlest Self."
12,"The brilliance of all of the suns that is revealing this entire world, the brilliance that is in the moon, and the brilliance that is in fire as well – know that that brilliance is Mine. ","Dear sadhak! That flow of light is coming from you (see 4th sloka [unclear reference]) and revealing this world. As universe-pervading as you are – look, look – that great light of yours is similarly universe-pervading. Earth, tree, stones – because their opaqueness makes them unable to shine forth your light, your light has not left either their outer or inner places. As you are Vishnu, your light too is pervading the universe-sheath. Because of the transparentness of the moon, sun and fire, your light is shining forth on their bodies. That is why, in order to destroy the delusion of the jiva, you are saying, “That light of the sun – (“AdityanAmahaṃ viShNu” [I am Vishnu among the “adityas” [suns; of solar dynasty]]) – that which is illuminating the whole world – that light of the moon and fire – know that that brilliance is My brilliance.” Lord! Lord! How Complete!"
13,"Through the power of “ojas” [pure essential energy] I enter earth, and hold all phenomena and living beings. And by being the essence-filled moon, I nourish all medicines/nourishers. ","The subtle is sustaining the physical/gross. The more that one is sense-oriented, the more is that being physical/gross. Earth holds eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin – these five senses. Thus, earth is gross. Because water holds eyes, ears, tongue, skin – these four senses, it is subtler than earth. And again, fire holds eyes, ears, skin – these three senses. Therefore, fire is subtler than water. Similarly, because air holds ears and skin – these two senses, it is subtler than fire. And because space only holds ears, it is subtler than air. Mind is not the holder of any of the senses. For this reason, mind is subtler even than space. Intellect, ego and chitta [personal consciousness] are only changes in the states of mind. What can be understood by this is that mind is subtle, and the five elements such as space, etc., or anything that is of the five elements – all of that is physical/gross. This mind is that which is holding those five elements, because if there is no mind, they [the elements] also do not exist. That is why it is being said that the subtle is sustaining the physical/gross. Then again, compared to “I”, mind is physical/gross as well, because even without contacting the senses, the mind can be felt. But “I” cannot even be felt. (The one that goes to feel “I” – that one becomes “I”.) Therefore, it “I” Who Am the subtlest of the subtle. The subtler one is, the more is that one’s “ojas” [pure energy]. Water is ten times subtler than earth; therefore, the pervading power of water is ten times that of earth. Similarly, because no one/nothing is subtler than “I”, the pervading power of “I” is greater than all [others’ pervading power]. Thus, “I” am present inside and outside everything/everyone. When it is like this, it is called “holding.” Thus, “I” am holding everything/everyone as My own. Not only that – in the form of the all-essence-endowed “soma” (moon), “I” place the particles of My Essence in rice, barley, sesame, wheat and such medicines/nourishers (the things by which the jiva is saved from hunger and illness), and “I” am doing the nourishing as well. "
14,"“I”, being “vaishvanara” [digestive fire] and entering the body [or: entering the middle of the body], join with prana and apana [certain vital airs] and digest the four types of food.","The Lord is presiding in the form of “vaishvanara” fire [digestive fire] in the belly of the living being. That fire, upon mixing with the self-stimulating prana and apana, digests these four types of edible foods: “charvya” – that which is consumed by chewing; “choshya” – that which is consumed by sucking; “lehya” – that which is consumed by licking; [and] “peya” – that which is drunk. That is why this “vaishvanara” fire is the support for all living beings. Through the management of heat/pressure in all of the body, he is preserving the life-force. When he is disturbed, the body is also disturbed, and it is when he leaves that the body dies. Every day, yogis do “agnihotra” [oblations in the fire] with this sadhana [practice] – “pranApanau samau kṛtvA” [keeping prana and apana equal] – to appease this “vaishvanara.”"
15,"I have entered into the hearts of all living beings. It is from Me that the living beings have their memory, knowledge and the loss (of these two). I am the “vedya” (the thing to be known) via all of the Vedas. I am the goal of Vedanta and its creator, and I am the knower of Vedanta.","What is meant by “sarva” [all] – they/it have/has two states. One is “saṃghaat” [collision]; the other is “vilaya” [full dissolution]. Upon using discrimination and analysis on these two states, thoroughly and more thoroughly, and then coming to that place where that thoroughness will no longer suffice – that is the place that is called “the middle” or “hridaya” [heart]. “Yato niryAti viShayo yasmiṃshchaiva praleeyate; hṛdayaṃ tadvijAneeyAt manasah sthitikAraNam.” [Bengali translation] “The place from which the worldly experience comes forth, [and] the place in which the worldly experience dissolves, that is that which is called ‘hridaya’ [heart], the heart that is the cause of the settledness of mind.” [End of Bengali translation] There is no place for settledness in anything at all other than “I”. Everything/everyone is restless; only “I” Am Still. Whoever comes and falls into “I”, that one becomes Still. I am present in the hearts of that “sarva” [all], like milk mixed in with water. Taking refuge in Me, verily, the fortunate ones – being Brahman before, and then becoming exhausted in the games of dressing up as a jiva, and then again remembering the state of Brahman before – regain that remembrance, and upon getting the knowledge “ahaṃ brahmAsmi” – I Myself am Brahman – get Emancipation. And the wrongful sinners, caught up in the intoxication of Maya, ruin that memory and knowledge. Both [memory and knowledge, and their loss] are happening on Me, verily. That is why it is being said that the rise and fall of memory and knowledge are in Me. These “sarva” [all] are [attempting to know “I” via] Sama, Rik, Yaju, Atharva – meaning: the object to be known – “I” – via “karmakanda” [the part of the Vedas regarding works], and “jnanakanda” [the part of the Vedas regarding knowledge]. Thus, the final fruit of “vivartavada” [Vedantic assertion] and [the final fruit] of all knowledge – both of these are verily “I”."
16,“Kshara” [destructible] and “Akshara” [Indestructible] – these two “purushes” [spirits] are well known in the world. It is said that the phenomena and individual beings are “kshara purush” and “Kutastha” is “Akshara Purush.”,"It is like: if one person from one family attends an invitation, it is accepted that the family itself has gone there – similarly, placing the title “Purush” on the One and Only Lord Vishnu – if anything in creation (even sticks or stones) is called “purush,” it will not be a lie. It is like the “dhatu” of vedic astrology. In creation, purush is of two types. One type, the phenomena and individual beings from the creator Brahmaa to stones and ultimately to the end of created things – all of this is “kshara” – meaning: perishable purush. And another is the directly experienced “kuta,” the deceptive, illusory mass itself, from which the endless seeds of samasara pour forth – that Maya, the Maya that has benumbed Consciousness/Spirit and has put It in the abyss, yet the knowledge of taking Consciousness/Spirit into the abyss has not arisen in her, and she is existing as salt taken from the sea (it is Maya’s revelatory light but there is nothing operative; that is why Kutastha Purush is knowledge). This type of Maya is actually “Akshara Purush.” (See “Kutastha” in Chapter 8 [of the Pranab Gita].) Even though rays of light pour forth from the sun without stopping, the sun does not diminish. The pouring forth of the seeds of samsara from Maya is like that. These two are the ones that are [together] called “sopadhik purush” [modified purush]."
17,"But the Supreme Person (different from “kshara” and “Akshara”) is known as “Paramatma.” [Supreme Self], the One Who is God and Non-diminishing. And He has entered the three worlds and is ruling them. ","There is another Purush Who is separate/different from “kshara” and “Akshara.” He is called “Uttam Purush” [Supreme Person]. There is no purush [being] that is higher than Him. He has no names such as “purush” or forms. Yet. because He is above all “purushes” [beings], He is called “Purushottama” [Higher than purush; Supreme Purush]. Although He is absolutely different from those two titled purushes, and because of being present in all phenomena and beings as Consciousness/Spirit Itself – as the inner Self (Supreme Self) and being in Earth, the underworld and heaven – He is beyond the ignorance-created bodies and such with the five sheaths. Yet, He is holding the cosmos with His own Consciousness-Strength and Power, and is the Non-diminishing Ruler. For this reason, He is called “Uttam Purush” [Supreme Person]. “Asaṃspṛshya shareereNa yena vishvaṃ chiraṃ dhṛtam” [without contacting body, ever holds the cosmos]. "
18,"Because I am beyond “kshara” and am even superior to “Akshara” – for this reason, I am renowned as “Purushottama” [Ultimate Person; Supreme Person] to people and the Vedas. ","As I am beyond the Maya-filled phenomena/beings and the “kshara purush” in the form of the “ashvattha” tree (samsara), and as I put “Akshara Kutastha,” the source of the seeds of samasara, below Me as well, and as I stay high up above – that is why in the world of people and the Vedas, because I reside above the two purushes, I am renowned as “Purushottama” [Ultimate Person; Supreme Person]. "
19,"O Bharat [Arjuna]! The one who has become free of ignorance in the stated way, and thus knows Me as Purushottama – that one becomes the knower of all, and is absorbed in Me [or: meditating on Me; worshipping Me] in all ways [or: in all states of being]. ","O Bharat [Arjuna; the sadhak]! The fortunate sadhak who, through the strength of sadhana, cuts through the delusional intoxication of Maya and directly sees this “I” (Purushottama) – meaning: tearing apart the net of the matters of Maya, comes into this “I” – that being becomes a knower of all – meaning: that which is the knowledge of all knowledge – knowing that, becomes absorbed in the meditation/worship of “I” – meaning: in all states of being, that being cannot see anything other than “I”."
{20}{stop},"O Anagh [sinless one; Arjuna]! I have now stated this most secret scripture in this summarized way. O Bharat [Arjuna], after understanding this (anyone) becomes a knower of all, and succeeds in all that there is to be done.","O sinless one! That, which is the greatest secret, from which even Maya Herself is revealed, but is the One that She does not have the power to reveal – I have just explained to you that teaching of Brahman through conversation in this chapter. The intelligent ones use their intellect with this teaching, and succeed in all that is to be done – meaning: the Settledness in Brahman that is there after all of the doing that there is – they get that, verily. And for them, there is no space/need to find meaning/value in that which needs to be done."
