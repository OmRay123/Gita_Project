1,Arjuna said: “O Hrishikesh [Sri Krishna]! O Mahabahu [mighty-armed; Sri Krishna] Keshinisudan [slayer of Keshin; Sri Krishna]! I want to know the truth/knowledge about ‘sannyas’ [renunciation] and ‘tyaga’ [casting off attachments and such] and their differences.”,"The subjects that have been spoken about in the [Bhagavad] Gita-scripture from Chapter One to Chapter Seventeen – all of that is being discussed in a summarized form – or, [in other words,] a recapitulation is being done – here in this Chapter Eighteen. The word “yoga” points to two states – one is the state of “sannyas” and another is “tyaga.” Usually, it is accepted that if someone is a “sannyasi” or a “tyagi” – that both mean the same thing. Is that really true, or is there some difference between these? To know this very thing, the question arose in the sadhak’s [aspirant’s] mind. O Keshinisudan [slayer of Keshin; Sri Krishna] – the word “kesh” [hair] means “covering hairs” – that which covers up. “Keshinisudan” – meaning: the One Who is Self-revealed, the destroyer of the power that covers up knowledge. Questions are born of ignorance. In order to destroy that ignorance, [the Lord] has been addressed as “Keshinisudan” – meaning: the Slayer of “daitya[s]” [demon[s]]. “Daitya” [of the lineage of “Diti”] refers to the corrupted kshatriyas [warriors]. The state of performing Kriya is the sadhak’s state of “kshatriya.” “KshatAt trAyate iti kshatriyah” [one who delivers one from destruction/harm is “kshatriya]. “Kshata” [wound; harm] is “incompleteness.” The one who is delivered from this incompleteness and makes effort to become complete – that is the one who is called “kshatriya.” In this state of kshatriya – meaning: due to a question arising during the performance of Kriya, [the situation] became corrupted. To destroy this corruption, the sadhak surrendered to Vishnu – meaning: looked toward one’s own Awareness. By doing so, all of the senses stopped, and they were no longer able to keep the sadhak enslaved in their powers. That is why the word “Hrishikesh” is used. “Hrishikesh” [Director/Ruler of the senses] = “hrishika” (means “of all of the senses”) + “eesh” (Director/Ruler). In this state, the effort to understand the deeper meanings of “sannyas” and “tyaga” is being made. O Mahabahu (Mighty-armed; Sri Krishna)! (Whatever there is to know is under the dominion of Self-Awareness. That is why the word “Mahabahu” is being used.) Explain to me the essential truth of sannyas and tyaga [their difference[s]). "
2,The Lord said: “‘Kavi[s]’” [poets; see commentary below for spiritual definition] say that the renunciation of desirous actions is that which is called ‘sannyas.’ The wise/visionary ones call the renunciation of the fruits of all types of actions ‘tyaga.’”,"“Sribhagvanuvacha” [the Lord said] – meaning: the discerning through Self-Awareness. Sound, touch, sight, taste, smell – these are the desired things. That is why these are called “kama” [desire[s]]. “Karma” [act] [is] the moving of vayu [vital-force] in the path of Brahman. So it becomes thus: there is the moving of vayu in the path of Brahman, and there is also the slipping off and the reminder of the worldly-experience in their innumerable forms. This state where these two come together is called “kamya karma” [act with desire] ([explained] in Chapter 6, sloka 26). Where one thing cannot be seen twice, and the new arises at every moment – those who live in this place [state] are called “kavi.” Those kavis say “sannyas” indeed is the destruction of the aforementioned “kamya karma.” The form of that sannyas is like this: in the path of Brahman, the moving of vayu is happening; the mind too is coming and going [moving] in union with vayu; but, the aimed place of the mind – the State of Vishnu – the mind is not letting go of attention on that aim. The name of this state is “sannyas.” Kriyavan sadhaks know this very well. And what is the renunciation of all fruits of all actions? But this: when the mind has become intoxicated upon continuously doing Kriya, when Kriya is no longer being remembered by the mind, when mind is locked only in Kutastha Itself, when it is not being dislodged from the State of Vishnu, when it is not coming and going, but because of the effect of practice, vayu is moving in every place in the path of Brahman, and has not yet stopped – meaning: there is the Eternal (the Settledness in Brahman); there is the natural happening (the enjoyment of paravastha); there is no obstacle to karma [the moving of prana], yet the mind is not bound to anything at all – this kind of state is called “the state of the renunciation of the fruits of karma [actions].” The longer that one can stay in this state, the more “tyagi” that person is. The endless abidance [in the Self] is called “[being] tyagi.” Those for whom the perception of Prakriti and Purush is unbroken and steady – they are called “vichakshana” [wise; visionary]. They are the ones who called these aforementioned persons endowed with this state [of renunciation] “tyagi[s].” "
3,"Some “manishee[s]” [sages; see commentary below for deeper definition] say that karmas [rites] are error-bound and therefore are actions to be given up. Some others say that the actions of yajna [rites], charity and austerities are actions that should not be given up.","Those who have brought their “mana[s]” [mind[s]] under control are “manishee[s].” Those “manishees,” upon tasting the nectar of the Settledness of Brahman, do not even like the vibrations of “karma” (the moving of prana [yogically]). So for them, “karma” [yogic act] is an action to be given up. And others whose minds have not been brought under control – they say that yajna [rites], austerities, charity, Kriya are not things to be given up. "
4,"O most excellent of the Bharata clan [Arjuna]! Listen to My talk, given with certainty, about the matters of such “tyaga” [renouncing]. O greatest of men [Arjuna]! Tyaga is also said to be done in three ways.","O savior of the Bharata clan, the greatest of men [Arjuna]! The “tyaga” [casting off; renouncing] that has been previously spoken about – that tyaga is also of three types. Listen, as I speak about their distinctions. "
5,"yajna, charity, austerities, karma [rites] are not things to be renounced. They are obligatory actions. Yajna, charity, and austerities are verily the things that purify the chitta[s] [personal consciousness[es]] of the “manishees” [sages]. ","If one remains with mind, then one cannot stay without yajna, austerities, charity – all these [types of] actions. The samskaras [latent tendencies] make one do these [acts] automatically/spontaneously. As such, the ingredients (masala [spices]) needed to purify the antahkarana [operators of personal consciousness] of the discerning ones are yajna, charity and austerities."
6,"O Partha [Arjuna]! But one must renounce the association to, as well as the fruits of, all of these karmas [aforementioned acts that should not be renounced]. This is My certain and best view [on this matter].","Just as all of the legs of an elephant find their places in the circumference of the leg-area of the elephant – similarly, via the moving of vayu in the one path of Brahman, all karmas [actions] of yajna, charity and austerities are accomplished. However, because no association – meaning: no contact with the desire-form of Maya – remains, one does not become enwrapped in the fruits of [the aforementioned] actions. That is why it is being said that doing yajna, charity, austerities, karma [yogic act] while relinquishing association (the desire for the fruits of actions) [with them] is one’s absolute duty. O Partha [Arjuna; the sadhak]! This is My best view [on this matter]. (Chapter 2, slokas, 45, 49; Chapter 3, sloka 9; Chapter 5, sloka 10; Chapter 9, slokas, 20, 21.)"
7,But the action that is to be always done should not be relinquished. To relinquish that due to delusion is said to be a tamasic [delusional] act.,The teaching of the renouncing of desires for results [of actions] does not teach the renouncing of [appropriate] action. The renouncing of such actions done by non-discerning fools under the power of delusion – that is called “tamasic tyaga.”
8,"The one who relinquishes actions due to sorrow and/or the pains of the body – that one does “rajasic tyaga,” and cannot attain the fruit of renunciation (Liberation). ","“There is no more profit in the trade. There is nothing but bickering.” That teaching of doing actions without the desire for results – according to that perception [in the first sentence of this commentary], there is nothing that has a beginning, end and middle to be had [by doing a spiritual act]. It is just sitting and “washing space.” By doing this [renunciation for wrong reasons], stiffness comes to the body; with time, it becomes bent and broken. Those who renounce those [previously mentioned] actions due to such imagined fears – they are bound to do other actions. But the fruit of that sacred renunciation – the Settledness in Brahman or the Knowledge of Brahman – that they do not get. Their renunciation is called “rajasic tyaga.”"
9,"O Arjuna! The karma [action] that is always done with the understanding that it is obligatory, and with the relinquishing of association and [the relinquishing of the desire for] results (the tyaga that happens with that) – that tyaga is called “sattvic [tyaga].”","Whatever is happening outside due to the habitual operations of the organs of the senses and the organs of action, and inside, the movement of prana is also going in an unattached way – this controlled action – in this, neither is there any attachment to the fruits of actions, nor is there any attachment to renouncing – no thinking of “I am renouncing.”"
10,"The tyagi [one who has cast off attachments], because of being filled with goodness, being of steady intellect and being free of doubt, does not hate actions that cause sorrow and does not have dearness for actions that cause pleasure. ","The word “satbhaava” [living in goodness] is called “sattva” – meaning: that which brings forth truth, justice, mercy, devotion, magnanimity, purity etc. – meaning: the Self. One who is established in the Self, one who, abiding in the Self as oneself, does not take in anything extra to the Self into the antahkarana – that one is called “sattvasamavishta” [abiding in goodness]. The one who has become certain that the Self Itself is Forever, and that everything extra to That is impermanent, and therefore has abandoned everything that is impermanent – that is the one who is called “tyagi.” The intelligent one with the strength of remembrance – meaning: I Am Brahman and nothing else – the one in whom this remembrance does not waver – that is the one who is called “medhaavi” [intelligent]. The sadhaks [aspirants] who are in these states do not at all have any doubts in them. That is why they do not hate actions that are not beneficent, and they do not become fond of actions that are beneficent."
11,Persons with body-vanity are not able to fully relinquish all actions. (Thus) the one who relinquishes the fruits of actions – that is the one who is known as “tyagi.”,"Those who are sitting there thinking that the body is “I”, who do not maintain the right to move vayu [vital-force] in the path of Brahman, who just go about doing things with the worldly experience outside – these types of ignorant ones are called “dehabhrit” [servants of the body]. These beings dress up as “I am the doer,” and thus, not being able to renounce karma [the fruits of actions], they are choked in the bindings of karma. And those who are discriminating – only they – because they perform karma [actions] while renouncing the fruits of karma – acquire the name of “tyagi” (Chapter 2, sloka 21)."
12,"Bad, good and mixed – these three types of fruits happen for the non-tyagis [non-renunciates of the worldly experience] after the falling of the body [death]. But this does not happen for the sannyasis anywhere at all.","Good, bad, and good and bad mixed – these are the three types of fruits of actions. With good fruits – attainment of godliness happens; with bad fruits, there is the experience of hell; and with mixed fruits there is human-ness. Those who are non-tyagis – meaning: who have succumbed to desires – for them these fruits are “paratra” – meaning: they have to experience these in the afterlife [or: next life]. But those who are “sannyasis” – meaning: those who are renunciates of the fruits of actions – all of these fruits of actions cannot touch them. This is because: by following the statement “tat kuruShvamadarpaNam” [do that as an offering to Me], and thereby surrendering all of their actions to the Lord, they are free of the bindings of karma [actions and their fruits]. Any sins that may occur unknown to them because of just carrying the body and going about, those who vilify them [the sannyasis] – those reproachers take on those sins. And the good that the sannyasis do knowingly – those who praise them [the sannyasis] are the ones who get those beneficent fruits."
13,O mighty-armed one [Arjuna]! Now learn from Me these following five causalities/factors that are spoken about in Sankhya (in Vedanta) for the accomplishments of all actions.,"O mighty-armed one [Arjuna]! The scripture that brings about the dawning of the Knowledge of the Self through renunciation and thereby destroying [the influence of] all the elements – that is called “Sankhya.” And the scripture that makes one understand the impermanence of the entire creation and the permanence of the Self through these methods: knowing matters of non-knowledge, the covering up of spirituality, and incongruities in concepts – that is that which is called “kritanta” or “Vedanta.”

The scripture by which the matters of knowledge can be accounted, [can be] ascertained – that is called “Sankhya” [analyzed; accounted] – meaning: “Vedanta” [the culmination, or end of knowledge]. “Kritanta” [the end of doing] – this is a specialty of Sankhya itself! “Krita” means “karma” [work]. That in which such work comes to its end (completion) – that is called “kritanta” [end of work], “karmanta” [end of karma [action]], or “Vedanta siddhanta” [goal of Vedanta]. In this, when, through statements such as “yavAnartha udpAne” [a simile using bodies of water, stated in 2:46 of the Bhagavad Gita], “sarvaṃ karmAkhilaṃ pArtha jnAne parisamapyate” [all rites eventually culminate in knowledge], there is Self-Knowledge, the ending of all karmas [actions and rites] that happen – that is being shown. And there are five causalities/factors that bring the end of all karmas so that there can be the attaining of that Self-Knowledge. Knowing those five causalities/factors is required. That is what the Lord is explaining in the very next sloka [18:14 of the Bhagavad Gita]. "
14,"[They are:] the place of the act, the doer, the different causalities, the many types of efforts, and among these, the fifth – is deity. ","(1) “Adhishthan” [place of the act] = that which I have [mistakenly] accepted as “I” – meaning: the body. (2) “Karta” [doer] = the experiencer with attributes – meaning: none of the body, senses, mind and such are “I”; each of these are separate from “I”; but, due to the influence of ignorance (like smearing some paste on space), I have mixed with these as one, and have dressed up as “I” (like: “I am thinking”; when in actuality, I do not think; it’s the mind that thinks; but having mixed together with mind, it is as if I have accepted the idea: “mind is ‘I’”; these states of blending [with the illusory] – this way of being). (3) Five organs of action, five organs of perception, mind and intellect – these twelve factors [together]. (4) “Vividha cheshta” [different kinds of efforts] – the many temporary manifestations due to the attraction, repulsion and union of the 49 vital airs – that which is known as “purushkar” [done by the person]. (5) “Daiva” [deity] means the unseen; or: the fruits of previously done actions, the acts done by gods or providence, and as well, [the word also means] deity. These five are the causalities of the accomplishment of karma [actions or rites]. Among these, the fifth causality – “daiva” – is particularly complex. That can be better understood by examining the subject a bit deeper with an engaged mind.

The effort or endeavor that a human being makes to accomplish some action – that is that person’s “purushkar” – meaning: “kriyaman karma” [work done at the present time, accumulating its fruits for the future]. It is through “kriyaman karma” that one hopes for [desired] fruits, and without “kriyaman karma” there is no fruition at all. But there are several causalities/factors behind kriyaman karma’s bringing forth its fruits. Among those causalities/factors, the first of those causalities/factors is “shiksha” [learning]. Without learning, there is no accomplishing of karma [action]. That learning is of two types. One is the learning from this life, or experience – that which is called the fruits of the “purushkar” of this life, or “samskaras” [impressed tendencies]; and another is the learning that is from previous lives; that is called “purva samskara” [previous samskaras], “prarabdha” [meaning: bound by actions and thoughts in previous lives], “adristha” [unseen], [and/] or “daiva” [ordained; or: of the subtle realms]. (“Purvajanmakṛtaṃ karma taddaivamiti kathyate” [action [bearing fruits in this life but] done in previous lives is said to be “daiva”].) When this daiva, by the name of prarabdha karma, is supportive of kriyaman karma [present action], kriyaman karma is carried out without blocks; and when it is against [kriyaman karma], [kriyaman karma] is full of obstacles. The second causality/factor is “prakritic niyam” [natural laws] – that which is called “devakrita vidhan” [divinely ordained happenings]. When natural law is supportive, good fruits appear from kriyaman karma; otherwise it does not happen. It is like: the ground in which a seed is planted – that ground must be supportive to the seed, and as well, water, sun, air and open space according to the needs of the seed must be there; only then can the planted seed in that ground sprout. And gradually, it can change into the form of a tree and give fruit. But that is dependent on time. That is why time is also a causality/factor. But that [time] is actually part of natural law. This “time” in the forms of “kalakashtha” [ancient temporal divisions] etc. is divided in many ways. In each fragment, time shows different powers, and different transformations. Therefore, time is a significant aspect in the accomplishment of an act. And the third causality/factor is “daiva” or “devata” [deity] that is the ruler of all and the bestower of the fruits of the act. He is in every single kriyaman karma [present action] of the living beings. Examining together the person’s efforts of this and previous lives, natural laws, and the particular aspects of time, He metes out good or bad fruits. He is unbiased in his examination of law. He is all-knowing, all-powerful, non-preferential, and non-selfish. However, He is under the power of the devotee’s devotion to the Supreme. God is a slave to devotion/devotee. He has said in the [Bhagavad] Gita that “varta eva cha karmaNi” – meaning: He is adjoined to acts in the form of the infallible fruits of the acts. His impartial meting out of law is carried out non-preferentially, effectively and strongly even to the devotee doing purushkar [present efforts], not a bit of it is adjusted or made more or less. However, that [devotee] is rescued by the Lord’s Mercy due to the devotion with which the purushkar is being done. Due to the power of that Mercy, the devotee is rescued, as the aforementioned fruits of judgment happen weakly in some places, in some places without fruition, in some places they are diverted from where it is supposed to happen, and in some places the fruit is destroyed – like if a roof is put on, one can block the sun and rain. The meting out of the fruits of that devotion – that is that which is the actual “daiva” [divinely bestowed]. And [the statement] “na cha daivAt paraṃ balam” [[among these five,] the divinely ordained is the most powerful; or: nothing surpasses the supreme power of the divine] refers to that. Now, it is with the aspect of daiva that one has to understand the fruits of judgment given out by the ordainer and judge of the fruits of actions. It is when that aspect is supportive that there is the accomplishment of kriyaman karma [act being done now], the non-accomplishment when the [daiva aspect] is in opposition, and a mixed result when these two are mixed.

Therefore, without effort, or purushkar, the power of the divinely ordained does not manifest. And if the power of the divinely ordained is not supportive, there is no fruit from effort alone. That is why, daiva [the divinely ordained] and purushkar [present effort] are compared to the two wings of a bird. If both are not there, fruits do not come forth."
15,"The lawful and harmful acts that human beings do through the body, speech and mind – these are their five causalities/factors. ","No matter what works, lawful and unlawful, are endeavored into by humans via the body, speech and mind – there are no other causalities/factors related to those works other than these five."
16,"About that matter (regarding all types of acts), even if it is like this (meaning: even with these five causalities/factors) – the person that views [through thought alone] the Self as the attribute-less, unassociated Doer – that imperfect perception, because of it being from an unenlightened intellect, cannot see the whole.","I am the Self, Only-Rama, Eternal, Immaculate, Free Non-doer. Not one of the five [causalities/factors] that have been mentioned can touch me. But those who [actually] think “I see” when the eyes see, “I do” when the hands do, “I make” when the mind makes, “I have made certain” when the intellect is making certain – by making themselves (own selves) as “doer”, they remain with unrealized intelligence (they believe in the “I am the body” vanity) and wrong perception (meaning: their opinion or mind stays with the causalities/factors of birth and death; they cannot remain in the Self as the Self; they remain far away from the Self). That is why they, even while seeing “I”, cannot see It. They go around and about far away [from the Truth]."
17,"The one who does not have egotistical ways, the one whose intellect is not wrapped up [in samsara] – that one, even if he/she kills all of these people [or: kills in all of these planes], actually does not kill, and is not bound (by the fruits of such actions).","The one for whom, through the practice of Kriya, the State of “I” has become firm, the one whose intellect finds no space or time to think of him/herself as “doer,” the one who remains in the Self unbrokenly as the Self, who does not become wrapped up in anything with beginning, end and middle – if spontaneous killing happens in this world of people [or: in these planes-worlds] just by the moving of his body (like: I am laying there; a bedbug is biting; I turned to the side; in the sleepy state of turning the bedbug died), that person is not the doer of such killing, nor does that person become bound by the karmic fruits born of killing. (See Chapter 2, slokas 17 through 21.)"
18,"Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower – these are the threefold causalities for the taking of action. The instrument, act and the doer of the act – these are the three types of constituents of action – meaning: the recourse for the act. ","It is like: a pot is an object. Its cause is the potter (the doer). Clay (the basis), kiln, wheel, stick etc. ([are] instruments). The using of hands and such actions ([are] efforts). And the ability of the potter to create a pot ([is] “daiva” [the unseen factor]). In order to produce the pot, these five are necessary. But if only these five are there, does the making of a pot happen? – meaning: even if clay, wheel, the potter and his/her physical ability and skills are there, if the pot is not [actually] made, then can there be a pot? If something makes one go into doing the work of producing a pot, only then can it happen, otherwise not. That is why it is being said: that if any work is to take place, these five causalities/factors and a desire/need to do the act has to be there. Who is that “desirer”? None but knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower. “I need such and such thing.” Here, that feeling of need is “knowledge.” The thing is “the object of knowledge.” And I am the “knower.” If that thing is not needed by/desired by me, would I make efforts for that? Thus, knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower – these are enjoined (bound) to action. And when some particular thing was determined to be something needed/desired by me, then through the operations of eyes, ears, hands and feet [and such], I got/made that thing. Here, those eyes ears and such are the instruments. The operations that are done comprise the act, and I am the doer. That is why it is being said that the instruments, the work, and the doer comprise the recourse for action – meaning: action is dependent upon these three.  "
19,"In Sankhya scripture – knowledge, act and doer – each are stated as being divided into the three types of gunas [primal qualities] such as sattva etc. I am elucidating (speaking) about those. Listen. ","That by which all of the gunas can be completely known – that is indeed the accounting of the gunas [or: analysis of the gunas] – meaning: the Sankhya scripture. Knowledge, act and doer – the forms in which these three have been illustrated in that Sankhya scripture, according to the gunas sattva, rajas and tamas [influencing] knowledge, act and doer – that is what I  am telling you about, one by one. Listen.  "
20,"That [knowledge] by which one sees One Non-diminishing, Indivisible Essence in all things, know that that knowledge is sattvic.","All of these – from Maya to the end of inert matter – space, air, fire, water, earth, [and the] moisture-born, egg-born, seed-born [and] womb-born creatures that you are seeing as separate – all of these are destructible. That which is destructible – that is that which is impermanent. That in which all of these end – that is that which is Eternal and Non-diminishing. Thus, this separateness – these [manifestations] are showing as different only because of the differences of names and forms. Actually, there is no other [nothing else] besides the One. When this knowledge dawns – know that that is when it is sattvic [knowledge]."
21,But that knowledge by which it is seen that there is separateness in everything and that all manifestations are many – know that that knowledge is rajasic.,The knowledge that only sees that everything is separate – that knowledge is called rajasic.
22,"And that knowledge that is totally attached to one operative function (body or idols and such) (meaning: this [body or idol] itself is the Self or God – thoughts like this), [knowledge] that is without reason, devoid of lofty ideals, and trivial – know that that is that which is called tamasic knowledge.","This small, indulgence-filled body is the only thing that is “I”, and everything that there is visible in the world is only for my enjoyment – the knowledge that makes one have this conclusion, the knowledge that is devoid of sensibility and reason, that does not aim for the Supreme Goal, and is small in significance [or: confused] – that is called tamasic knowledge. "
23,"That action which is ever ordained, and which is done without desire, without attachment to/from the doer, and without like and dislike – that is called sattvic action.","When, due to cultivation, prana moves unabated in the path of Brahman, when there is no contact or touching of desire, affection or repulsion, what to say – when there is even no arising of the desire for the results of the action – that is that which is called sattvic action. "
24,"But the action that is with the desire for results, or done by egotistical persons, and [the action] that is done with a great deal of struggle – that is called rajasic action.",Durga Puja [an annual worshipping of the Divine Mother] is taking place at my house. The village is raucous with the sound of kettle- and barrel-shaped drums – this kind of fame-getting action is called rajasic action.
25,"The action that is performed under delusion, with backwards thinking regarding good or bad results, the action that is destructive, inflicts harm on others and is done by self-force, the action that is done without the concern for the whole – that is called tamasic [action]. ","There is no idea about what kind of consequences there will be. Not knowing my capabilities, I am fasting and awakening malevolent spirits in the cremation grounds so that I can kill my enemies. There are no injunctions, no mantras (the restlessness in the form of volition and non-volition that the mind has taken on – that which removes this restlessness – that is that which is called “mantra” [that which delivers the mind/heart]; this is known through the teachings of guru). This type of work done from ignorance – this is that which is called tamasic work."
26,"The doer who is without attachment, without egotism (self without pride), who has patience and enthusiasm, who is indifferent to accomplishment and failure as well as delight and disgust is called sattvic. ","The one for whom desires do not rise up during Kriya, for whom there is no sense of “me,” whose mind is bound to the path of Brahman, who progresses towards the Expanse of Brahman at every step, the one for whom there is no contact in the inner being with the ideas of accomplishment and failure – the sadhak [spiritual practitioner] who is in this kind of state is called a sattvic doer. (For as long as the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] is bound to the great thirst – this type of [spiritual] poverty-stricken state is called “asiddhavastha” [the state of non-accomplishment]; and the state of the attainment of attainments is called “siddhavastha” [the state of accomplishment/attainment]. For as long as this sense of attainment is there, for that long is there “vikar” [mutating; changing]. When there is Stillness in the Self, that cannot be called “vikar.”)"
27,"Attached to the worldly experience, greedy, desirous of the fruits of actions, being aggressive in nature, and unclean, the doer [who is like this and is] happy and sad in gain and loss is known as rajasic. ","The one in whose inner being there is attachment, the hankering for the fruits of actions, greed for others’ possessions, miserliness when it comes to [contributing to] good works and pilgrimages and such, who inflicts harm on others in order to save him/herself, the one for whom there is a lack of the stillness of mind that is the inner cleanliness, who behaves ruthlessly outside, delights in the acquiring of enjoyments such as gold etc., grieves when something [that is desired] is not acquired – that one is called rajasic doer."
28,"The doer who is unreasonable (negligent), devoid of discrimination, not gentle, deceitful, causes humiliation to others, is lazy, despondent and dilatory is said to be tamasic.","The one who cannot stay steady on one matter for very long, whose thinking is like a manipulative child, who is stubborn, without gentleness, has “one thing in the stomach and another in the mouth” [one who falsely represents him/herself], one who – for selfish gains – puts dust in the served rice of others [corrupts the needful things of others], who is lazy, indolent, always despondent like the salt boat has sunk [as if all is lost], does not do the work that is to be done today even in ten days’ time – this kind of doer is called a tamasic doer."
29,O Dhananjaya [Arjuna!] The three types of intellect and steadfastness according to the gunas are now being stated. Listen. ,"The sadhak [practitioner] has now reached the final stage of the “jnana-kanda” [phase of knowledge]. Now, being without karma [actions and their fruits], sitting in the state of non-doing, and abiding in the Self, the sadhak is seeing that everything in the world is according to the three types of gunas such as sattva etc. Among them the sattva guna is the one that is appropriate for taking up if betterment is desired. This is because “urdhaṃ gacchhanti sattvasthAh; madhye tiShThanti rAjasAh; adhogacchhanti tAmasAh” [upward goes the sattvic state; rajas remains in the middle; downward goes tamas]. In order to pick out only the sattvic condition from [the threefold conditions in] all of the things in the world, the sadhak, abiding in the Self and having the leisure to know, is observing the three types of conditions of everything. He/she sees the three types of states according to the three gunas in regards to knowledge, action and the doer. Now he is seeing the threefold conditions of intellect and steadfastness. If intellect and steadfastness are mastered, then the matters of attainments or the matters to know – nothing at all of those remain. When there is the enjoinment with pure intellect, the worldly experience, as well as likes and dislikes are abandoned, and the state of peacefulness comes about. Devotion to the Supreme dawns, and by that itself one gets to enter into the “I” Itself. Liberation happens. That the sadhak Arjuna is able to have victory in pure intellect – that is revealed by [his being addressed with] the name “Dhananjaya” (see commentary to Chapter 10, sloka 37 [of the Pranab Gita]). That is why he is being addressed as Dhananjaya and being told: “O Dhananjaya [Arjuna; the sadhak] – how the distinctions of intellect and steadfastness are according to sattva, rajas and tamas gunas – I am now telling you about that, separately and specifically. Listen.”"
30,"O Partha [Arjuna]! That by which pravritti [outward modes] and nivritti [inward modes], “karya” [the to-be-done] and “akarya” [the not-to-be-done], “bhaya” [fear] and “abhaya” [fearlessness], and “bandha[n]” [bondage] and “moksha” [Liberation] are known – that verily is sattvic intellect. ","Pravritti (Chapter 16, sloka 7 [of the Bhagavad Gita]). Nivritti (Chapter 16, sloka 7 [of the Bhagavad Gita]). “Karya” [the to-be-done] – [that which is] incomplete, that which has not been done [but/and] has to be done; and “akarya” [the not-to-be-done] – that which has already been done [and] one does not have to do it. “Bhaya” [fear] – the remembrance/awareness of death. “Abhaya” [fearlessness] – “I” Am Immortal – this certain knowledge. “Bandha[n]” [bondage] – the state of “jiva” [individual person]. “Moksha” – the presiding knowledge of Brahman. O Partha [Arjuna; the sadhak]! The intellect by which these are known with certainty – that is called sattvic intellect."
31,O Partha [Arjuna]! That by which dharma and non-dharma and karya [see commentary to 18:30 above] and akarya [see commentary to 18:30 above] are known incorrectly – that is indeed rajasic intellect.,"O Partha [Arjuna; the sadhak]! Dharma (see Chapter 9, sloka 2 [of the Bhagavad Gita]. “Adharma” [non-dharma] – the opposite of that [dharma]. Karya and akarya (see previous sloka [18:30]). [That which] brings delusion when one goes to understand the truth about all of these, [that which] makes one doubt (the non-believing intellect) – know that this kind of intellect is rajasic intellect."
32,"O Partha [Arjuna]! Being enveloped by tamas [guna], that which makes one think that non-dharma is dharma, and where every meaning (the thing to be known) is taken as its opposite – that is verily tamasic intellect.","O Partha [Arjuna; the sadhak]! The intellect that makes one think that dharma is non-dharma, non-dharma is dharma, and what to say – all the things that are to be known are known as their opposites – this ignorance-covered intellect is called tamasic intellect.  "
33,"O Partha [Arjuna]! The steadfastness that is with one-pointed mind, and by which all actions of mind, energy and senses are carried out in an orderly way (properly) – that is verily sattvic steadfastness.","That I have become a jiva [individual] and am engrossed in this created world, that I am doing “mine, mine” – this state of mine is my worldly state. And that in which the word “mine” cannot fit, where “I” am “I” Itself – that is My Expansive State of Brahman. To unite these two states is called “yoga” [union]. Through guru-instructed Kriya, upon my gathering up this contracted/confused worldly state of mine, and merging it in the Expansive “I” and thereby stopping the operations of mind, energy and senses, the uncorrupted (without vibrations) stillness that is there – the cultivation/ripening of that stillness – meaning: remaining locked in that [state] for a long time is called sattvic steadfastness."
34,"O Partha [Arjuna]! O Arjuna! But the steadfastness via which (humans) hold onto [the ideals of] dharma [religion], “kama” [desires] and “artha” [wealth], and being attached to those, become desirous of the fruits of actions – that is rajasic steadfastness.","And when the operations of mind, energy and senses fall off the path of Liberation and become associated with dharma [religion], “artha” [wealth] and “kama” [desires], and thus become engrossed in the satisfying of the lusts of enjoyment – O Partha [Arjuna; the sadhak]! this steadfastness – this actually is that which is called rajasic steadfastness."
35,"O Partha [Arjuna]! That by which the unintelligent ones are not able to be free of sleep, fear, grief, depression and conceit – that is verily tamasic steadfastness. ","And when in the waking and dreaming states I sit about dreaming, being with fear, grief, depression and conceit ([and] deludedly delighting in these) – to let go of even one of these, it feels like I am losing everything – this kind of power to hold on that is senseless – O Arjuna! – this is that which is called tamasic steadfastness."
36,"O Bharatarshabha [Arjuna]! Now hear from Me about the matters of the three types of happinesses, by which, due to the fruits of practice, Supreme Bliss is had and the end of suffering is attained. ","Now, the Lord is speaking to Arjuna about the matter of happiness – that happiness too is of three types due to the distinctions of the gunas such as sattva etc. What is the thing called “happiness”? Oh but this: so He is saying – that in which, due to the fruits of practice, Supreme Bliss is had and suffering is removed – that is “happiness.” The discipline of keeping mind still is called “practice.” “Suffering” means pains/troubles. These are of three types – “adhyatmik” [spiritual], “adhidaivik” [subtle] and “adhibhautik” [material]. The pain that is there from not getting the Company of the Supreme Self – that is adhyatmik suffering (this is mental). Because of opposition from “daiva” [the unseen] – meaning: the pain that is there due to the restrictions imposed by the gathered fruits of previously done actions causing failure or the blocking of an act [in the present] – that is adhidaivik suffering (this is mental and physical). And the pain that is born of the disturbances of vata-pitta-kapha [bodily humors – wind-bile-phlegm] – that is adhibhautik suffering (this is physical). The Lord is saying, “That in which, upon ending all of these sufferings, one has Supreme Bliss – that is ‘happiness.’ But how, due to the differences in the gunas, happiness too takes on three forms – I am telling you. Listen.”"
37,That which is of a type like: being poison-like in the beginning but changing into the nectarous/immortal blessing of Self-Knowledge – [happiness] that is born of this – that is sattvic happiness.,"Not finding one descriptive term that speaks of the state of sattvic happiness, the Lord says: that which is “tat” [that] – meaning: of that type, the type that the partaking enjoyers have known by enjoying; it has be known by enjoying it by oneself; it is not to be spoken about and stated; that which is poison-like in the beginning – because one has to go through a great deal of struggle when practicing knowledge, detachment, meditation, samadhi etc; but that which changes into evident Immortality – that is because the Blissful Glory that is had after the cultivation of knowledge, detachment etc. – that has no boundaries, no end, no diminishing – It is Infinite – Immortal. And that which is born of the blessedness of Self-Knowledge – meaning: later, the mind, [abiding] in the Self, becomes free of the contact with rajas and tamas [gunas], and rises as pure and clear – the happiness that is like this – this is the happiness that is called sattvic happiness. "
38,"That which (the well-known types are known by everyone), through contact with the worldly experience and the senses, looks nectarous/immortal in the beginning and changes to being poison-like – that happiness is said to be rajasic. ","And that happiness that rises up from the contact with the worldly experience and senses, the taste of which everyone has known by partaking, which first seems like nectar/immortality (like the cultivating of lust and greed, partaking in them) but results in a poison-like experience – like: taking away strength, potency, beauty, intuitive perception, intelligence, wealth, health, enthusiasm and such, bringing infirmity in youth, bringing suffering through apparent pleasures – that is that which is called rajasic happiness."
39,"The happiness that deludes oneself in the beginning and in the end as well, and comes forth from sleep, laziness and confusion – that is that which is said to be tamasic [happiness].","The happiness that makes one become lost (covers up intellect), puts one in sleep, laziness and confusion – like: I gathered up people of the same age, and took foodstuffs and went for a picnic; we made intoxicants from certain seeds and all of us consumed it; so much talking, chatting, so much laughter, so much fun – going on enjoying all this I became unconscious from the intoxication; the dogs and jackals came and ate all the food. I got up in the morning and came back with a drawn face. This kind of happiness-enjoying is called tamasic happiness."
40,"There is no being on Earth or in heaven, not even amongst the gods, that is free from these three gunas born of Prakriti. ","O Arjuna! This tree of samsara that has been imagined as having roots up above and such, that which has to be cut down with the weapon of resolute detachment – in this universe-sheath, whatever living or non-living beings that there are in whichever plane, from Bhu[-loka] and such to Satya-loka, gods such as Brahmaa, humans, even to the end of inert matter – whatever is there – all of that is born of the mutations of the types of the gunas of the guna-endowed Prakriti. There is nothing in any place or location that is free of that sattva, rajas and tamas, nor is there anything existing separate from them. If even a bit of one of the three gunas remains [in consciousness], one cannot have the attainment of withdrawing from the causalities of samsara. Know that all Vedas and Upanishads and other scriptures have the same teaching."
41,"O Parantapa [Arjuna]! The duties of brahmins, kshatriyas and vaishyas along with the shudras [the four castes] are distributed according to the gunas [qualities] which arise from their own natures.","If action, doer, results etc, as well as all of the living beings are all endowed with the three gunas [primal qualities], then where is Liberation for the jiva [soul]? Knowing that Arjuna can ask a question like this, the Lord is heading this off as well. The Lord is saying that if one worships the Supreme Lord while carrying out the actions that are ordained to one according to one’s rightfulness, Liberation comes via the blessed gift of Knowledge that comes from doing that. This is really the essence of the entire meaning of the [Bhagavad] Gita. This essence in a collective form is shown from this sloka “brAhmaNakshatriyavisham” [brahmins, kshatriyas, vaishyas] until the end of the chapter [18].
 
The work of brahmins, kshatriyas, vaishyas and shudras [the four castes] are all divided in specifically separate forms. These delegations have been made according to the qualities arising from natures and behaviors. A little bit has to be understood about divisions being made according to qualities arising from natures and behaviors. One’s nature is God’s Prakriti or the tri-guna-endowed Maya. This Prakriti manifests three types of operative powers. One is called sattva, one is called rajas, and another is called tamas. These three are called “guna[s]” [qualities]. Thus, “the qualities from natures and behaviors” means sattva, rajas, tamas – these three gunas. Whatever happens in the world – it is completed via these three gunas. If these gunas are separate from each other, no activity is able to take place. Not even “being able” – the gunas do not separate in the first place. From the many combinations of their union and mixing, the many different activities happen. If in that union and mixing all three gunas are of the same proportion, then a state of equilibrium happens; no activity can take place. All of the activities of the world take place from their mixing in unequal proportions. It is from the beginning of creation that the four types of “varna[s]” [castes] or classes have been created due to the variations of the mixing of the three gunas. In the first class, sattva [guna] is predominant; the other two gunas are subservient and succumb to sattva. In the second class, sattva mixed with rajas is predominant; tamas succumbs. In the third class, rajas mixed with tamas is predominant; sattva succumbs. And in the fourth class tamas mixed with rajas is predominant; sattva succumbs. The whole of the jivas [persons] are divided in these four classes. The jiva of the first class is brahmin; the jiva of the second class is kshatriya; the jiva of the third class is vaishya, and the jiva of the fourth class is shudra. Each of the three gunas has its own power of operation. But they mix. And according to the proportions of different mixes, there is the permutation into the four classes. Thus, the work of the brahmin class is of one type; the work of the kshatriya class is of one type; the work of the vaishya class is of one type; the work of the shudra class is of one type. That is why it is being said that all of the duties of the brahmins, kshatriyas, vaishyas and shudras have been ordained according to the gunas/qualities arising from their natures and behaviors.
 
There is a somewhat more particular meaning to the term “natures and behaviors.” According to each one’s fruits of [previous] actions, jivas [souls] take good and bad births. When the jiva leaves one body [dies physically] and is in the post-body state, it carries over the previously created mental and sensory state/s; thus, the samskaras [impressions in consciousness] from the previous birth remain. Being under the power of these samskaras, the jiva returns, and there the operative qualities converge – meaning: [the jiva] gets the qualities of one of the classes among the four classes. The previously carried over samskaras make up that which is called “nature” [of a particular person]. The qualities of a particular class that [the jiva] gets because of being under the power of that “nature” – that is “qualities arising from natures and behaviors.” So it can be said that no matter the class in which the jiva is partaking – such as brahmin etc., his/her work is ordained according to the qualities that have come forth from the samskaras created in the previous life/lives.
 
In the original sloka [18:41 of the Bhagavad Gita], brahmin, kshatriya and vaishya are grouped together in one compound word-segment, and shudra is in a separate segment. By this, the [idea that] the [first] three castes are “dvija” [can be twice-born; can be initiated] and that they have the right to the Vedas – that is what is hinted. And because shudras are excluded from the right to the Vedas, the [word “shudra”] is not included in the first compound word-segment [in the sloka].
"
42,"Serenity, forbearance, austereness, cleanliness, patience, transparency, knowledge, applications of knowledge and belief in the Supreme are the natural duties of the brahmin. ","The one who, due to purification of karma [actions bearing fruits] and samskaras [impressions in consciousness] in previous lives, spontaneously manifests within his/her inner being: serenity, forbearance, austereness, cleanliness, patience, transparency, knowledge, application of knowledge and such (which have been previously explained) – it is that person who will be accepting him/herself as brahmin. And by cultivating these, that person will attain Emancipation.  "
43,"Heroism, fiery power, steadfastness, skillfulness, not fleeing in battle, generosity and being connected with godly thoughts [alternate translation: having lordly behavior] – these are the natural duties of the kshatriya.  ","The power that does not allow one to become tired even after battling through the eight periods [the whole day and night] (Kriya) – the name of that great power is “shaurya” [heroic power]. “Teja” [fiery power] – is the power to burn the enemy (to bring Prakriti with her soldiers under the sadhak’s power). The power that does not allow the coming about of even a bit of hopelessness – that is “dhriti” [steadfastness], or the power to hold on (getting up above Ajna-chakra and keeping the attention firmly and unbrokenly on Supreme Shiva). Seeing directly the fruits coming forth from actions born of causes, and keeping them ready in the heart is “dakshata” [having skill]. No matter what situation takes place on the battlefield, to not turn one’s back and remain facing it is “apalayan” [non-fleeing] (keeping one’s sight on Kutastha at the time of coming down to the Muladhar from the Ajna-chakra, and again rising while still looking in that same direction – like going up and down a ladder). “Daan” = the acceptance of relinquishing. And belief in God – meaning: the attitude of accepting lordship and making [another] accept lordship. These are the natural duties of kshatriyas. By cultivating these, [the kshatriya] goes in the Upward Way.  "
44,"Farming, cattle raising, trade – these are the natural duties of vaishyas. Actions that are of the service-type are the natural duties of the shudra.","To do “karshan” [plowing] to the field is called “krishi” [farming]. Plowing the field – in the form of this body – with inhalation and exhalation (according to guru’s teaching) in the directed way brings forth good harvest. “Gorakshya” [ordinary meaning: cattle raising; deeper meaning follows] = the word “go” means the Earth/earth – meaning: this whole body. To keep in mind the delusion of protecting and taking care of this [body] (but it can never be protected from its transience) – keeping the senses under the control of a mind that is on a good path is “gorakshya” [maintaining and protecting the body]. “Vanijya” [trade] – keeping profit for oneself and keeping something and giving something. The sadhak who has the samskara-born habit of doing Kriya with this type of desire for results – that is the one who is vaishya. Even so, this one is “dvija” [twice born; initiated] (Chapter 17, sloka 14 [of the Bhagavad Gita]). By continuously practicing Kriya, this one will go gradually higher and higher by this alone, and attain Emancipation.

And the one who is deeply attached to spouse and child, does not want to do Kriya, is afraid, cannot do, yet whose heart always wants to serve those three types of sadhaks – that is the one who is called shudra. These good-hearted ones, upon continuously doing those kinds of service, and going on continuously hearing the discourses on the spiritual knowledge of the Self from being in the company of the sadhaks [sages], attain the Supreme Blessing."
45,"By endeavoring in each one’s particular duty (ordained according to rightfulness), human beings attain perfection. How the human being attains perfection in being engaged in work that is natural to that person – now hear about that. ","In the beginning, the sadhak [aspirant] will examine him/herself and find out “what is this person?” Whichever caste the sadhak’s mind accepts him/herself to be – he/she will perform the dutiful work according to that. Because brahmin is higher than all others, the other three castes should not perform actions/duties that are appropriate for brahmins. One should engage in works appropriate to one’s own caste, and endeavor to rise up to the level of the character of the caste just above one’s own. One should not try to skip this and jump to try to be greater. Being engaged in this kind of action, one attains “samsiddhi” (Supreme Blessing). How that Blessing is attained – that is being said (in the very next sloka [18:46]). Listen. "
46,"That from which the living beings arise, the One by Whom all of this is pervaded – by glorifying (worshipping) That One through one’s own natural duties, the human being attains perfection.  ","God is One without a second. He is in all beings and is Omnipresent. He is the Cause of creation. Thus it is from Him that the living come forth – meaning: arise. And it is only He Who is the ordainer of the fruits of actions. That is why it is from Him that the living beings get their engagements – meaning: endeavors. This means: the karma-bound jiva [individual soul], in order to experience the fruits of previously done actions, is born in appropriate lineages according to the Lord’s infallible justice, and gets the mental tendencies according to that [lineage].
 
God, according to the divisions of the qualities in actions, has created brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya and shudra – these four castes, and has ordained the natural duties for each of the castes. The caste in which the human being is born, such as brahmin etc. – that is due to the fruits of one’s own actions, but, due to the ordinance of the Lord, it [the birth] is to experience one’s previously gathered fruits of actions. Immediately upon taking on the body, the sanchit karma [previously gathered actions] that come forth to face one to bear fruits – those are called “prarabdha karma” [previously bound karma] – meaning: the karma that is starting to bear fruit [right away]. The body itself is the whole of prarabdha karma. Prarabdha karma is not removed unless it is experienced. But if that experiencing is done without attachment, when there is always an unattached mind, the karma is destroyed. Otherwise, if one does it with attachment or hatefulness, one again has to fall into bondage. That is why there is the system of performing acts and experiencing prarabdha without affection and repulsion. Thus, brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra – no matter in which lineage one takes birth, prarabdha has to be experienced. No one escapes from prarabdha, whether one is a saint or an infidel. Prarabdha is the fruit of one’s own [previous] actions. Therefore, this [prarabdha] itself can be called “svakarma” [one’s ordained duty]. If I am born in the lineage of shudras, then it will have to be understood that this is the fruit of my own actions or the ordainment of the Lord. Knowing this, and thereby not despising the duties or ways of being shudra, or not being indignant, I have to follow that path of action without despondency. That shudra-karma [duties of shudras] is at that time my “svakarma” [my ordained duty]. In whichever caste I take birth, the duty of that caste is my “svakarma.” By remaining detached and remaining engaged in one’s own duty, and thereby taking recourse in efforts towards the divine, one has to worship that One Who is within all and pervades all. Mind and energy have to be thrown into Him according to the methods instructed by guru. It is only then that I will gradually progress, become purified in heart, and attain perfection. This is the only way for humans to attain perfection – meaning: remaining in one’s duty and worshipping the Lord [while doing one’s duty]. All castes have the same system. And if I, no matter in which caste I take birth, despise and abandon the duties of that caste and do the work of another caste, and being under the power of egotism, “I am also a human being” – thinking this – try to become the same as of a higher caste – then, whether I worship God or whatever it is that I do – far be it to talk about cutting the bindings of my karma [actions and their fruits], they will only go on increasing. This is because: even if I am praised very much by people outside, my mind will not leave me. At that time, in my consciousness, my impressions of my despising and the impressions of egotism will rise up, and will for sure and infallibly attack with doubt and grief. And at the time of death as well, I will fall to the magnetism of those impressions. Thus, then I will be tied up by an abominable bondage, and (Chapter 16, sloka 19 [of the Bhagavad Gita]) accordingly, I will be thrown into a demonic womb.
 
God succumbs to devotion alone. In the path of devotion, there is no separation of rightfulness. This is because: in this, there are no particular acts that have to be performed that need certain strengths or capabilities. In this there simply has to be resolute faith from a pure heart. Therefore, everyone can remain doing the duties of one’s own caste and practice devotion. With this power of devotion, “striyo vaishyAstathA shudrAste’pi yAnti parAṃ gatim” [even women, vaishyas, shudras attain the supreme destination]. Doing each one’s own duties – meaning: one has to practice devotion while being engaged in stoically doing the duties of one’s own caste. It does not happen in another way. “Lojja, ghrina, bhoy, tin thaakte noy” [Bengali phrase regularly said by Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa, meaning: shame, despising, fear – if these three are there, then it will not happen]. Just as: if one falls into unfathomable water, one has to take recourse in that water itself, keep an aim for the shore and swim towards the shore; it is only then that one can get out of the water. There is no other way to get out of the water without taking recourse in the water. In the same way, it is by taking recourse in one’s own duty that one must keep the aim on God and become engaged in worship. Then karma [action and fruit] is relinquished.
 
To sum it up, in order for the human being to attain perfection, two things have to be done. The first is to be engaged in one’s own duty without having a sense of either honor or dishonor, and with having an unattached mind at all times. The second is worshipping, in that way [while being dutiful], God Who is in every heart and Omnipresent. This worshipping is a worshipping of great magnanimity. Here, the Lord does not mention any name or form of a deity to be worshipped. He only expressed, “yatah pravṛttirbhootAnAṃ yena sarvamidam tatam” [the one from whom all beings come forth, who pervades all this]. Here there is not a bit of a feeling of any religious order/lineage. By the usage of the word “pravritti” [endeavor; perform], it can be understood that “endeavoring” on the path of “nivritti” [spiritual withdrawal] through the performance of [spiritual] yoga is the method of this worship. Thus, effort according to the work is required. Through the effort in performing Kriya, and thereby worshipping that All-pervading, All power-causing One Who resides in all beings, perfection is attained."
47,It is better to do “svadharma” [one’s ordained life-path] imperfectly than to perform another’s dharma [life-path] well. No one incurs sin by doing duty born of one’s nature. ,"The duty born of one’s nature, or “svakarma” [one’s ordained duty] is being called “svadharma” [one’s ordained life-path] here. Thus, the duty born of one’s nature for the brahmin – brahmin-karma – is the svadharma of the brahmin. The natural duty of the kshatriya – kshatriya-karma – is the kshatriya’s svadharma. The natural duty of the vaishya – vaishya-karma – is the svadharma of the vaishya. And the natural duty of the shudra – shudra-karma – is the svadharma of the shudra. These four castes that are there – for any one caste of these four castes, the dharma of the other three castes is “paradharma” [the others’ dharma]. The word “viguna” [imperfect] means “with errors.” Concluding that the act of killing the elders gathered opposite to him in war is “viguna” [incorrect] – meaning: with errors or sinful, the sadhak Arjuna decided that the beggarly way is the way that can be properly enacted [due to the situation] – meaning: it would be commotion-free, peaceful and sinless. But “guNadoShadṛshirdoShah guNastu bhayavarjitah” – meaning: to see error is itself an error; to see virtue is also an error; seeing none of either error or virtue – that is the real virtue – Arjuna did not bring this into his understanding. He saw his “svadharma” of killing enemies in war as erroneous, and the “paradharma” of beggarliness as virtuous. That is why the Lord made him look at the dharma of his caste and said, “Even if others’ dharma is carried out well, the imperfect performance of one’s own dharma is better.” This is because: that seeing of error in one’s own dharma and see virtue in another’s dharma – that is the operation of egotism. Egotism tightens the bindings of karma. And again, if, due to the power of egotism, one’s own dharma is relinquished, then one is always bound to the impressions of errors and virtues. At the time of death, those impressions are awakened by the mind in the chitta [general personal consciousness], and make one take on a thinking state according to that. And therefore, instead of going beyond thinking states and attaining Emancipation, one has to wander about and around in the bondage of samskaras [impressions]. For this reason, the Lord is saying, “Not seeing errors and virtue, and staying to one’s own duty with always having an unattached mind, and worshipping that Ruler of all, there is the attainment of perfection.” Sin does not touch one if one is doing the duty born of one’s own nature. No matter what the duty born of one’s nature is, it is the fruit of one’s own previously done actions. It is now standing there in the form of “prarabdha [karma]” [fruits bound from the previous actions]. Thus, without experiencing that with detachment, that will not be destroyed. This is the reason that one’s own dharma is better than another’s dharma.
 
In this chapter [18], the Lord, having shown the states of the four castes of sadhana to the sadhak Arjuna, is engaging him to his “svadharma” [Arjuna’s own way according to his caste]. This commentary has been written in accordance with the following of the dharmas of the castes of sadhana. (See the commentary to the next sloka [18:48].) The way in which the commentary has been directed regarding “svadharma” and “paradharma” in Chapter 3 [of the Pranab Gita] – the sadhak should also be attentive of that. The reason: resultantly it is the same for both. That is why that commentary too is mentioned here.
 
“Viguna” [in this case: beyond the gunas] – “vigata guna” [when the gunas are gone], “nistraigunya” [devoid of the three gunas] (Chapter 2, sloka 45 [of the Bhagavad Gita]) – meaning: after merging, the Settlement in Brahman that is there – that is “svadharma” [one’s true way]. If one is not able to stay locked in it, coming down after the breaking of samadhi and again working and making effort to get samadhi – the coming and going is also better [than going to the worldly experience]. But “paradharma” [not one’s true way] – meaning: performing Prakritic dharma beautifully – meaning: remaining only with the functions of the forms of the worldly experience – is not better. And that Kriya that I am doing in order to attain that Settledness in Brahman (remaining with attention on Brahman at that time) – that is called “svabhavaniyata karma” [action that is ever connected to one’s true nature]. In this state, even if there is contact with the three gunas, one does not fall to the powers of Prakriti. To succumb to the powers of Prakriti is actually that which is called “sin.” (See Chapter 3, sloka 35; Chapter 5, sloka 10 [of the Bhagavad Gita].)"
48,"O Kaunteya [Arjuna]! Even if it is with errors, one should not abandon “sahaj karma” [natural rite], because at the beginning of every karma [rite], there is smoke (covering) the fire. ","“Sahaj” – the “jaat” [race; inborn particularities] that comes with birth – “sahaj” has this meaning. What is the karma [act/rite] that is born with birth? The operation of prana/breath is that which is born with birth. That is why the operation of prana/breath is called “sahaj karma.” For as long as the jiva [soul] is in the womb of the mother, it does not have any independent operation of exhalation and inhalation. The operation of prana/breath in its body gets done through the aid of the nadis [subtle passages in the mother and child] connecting the activities going on in the body of the Mother. At that time, the current of prana goes on flowing in a very subtle way in the child’s brahmanadi. It is from that that the seven essences are nourished. As soon as the body is birthed and the operation of exhaling and inhaling begins, right then, the flow of prana-current that was inside connects with the current in the nasal passages and gradually becomes outward-directed. Along with that, the jiva’s dreamlike previous memories are lost. It becomes deludedly captivated with its relationship to the external worldly experience. — Begin Footnote. — That is why the sadhak [saint] Ramprasad has sung: “I was yogi when in the womb, then I fell to the Earth and ate dirt.” This “eating dirt” is becoming deludedly captivated due to the contact with the worldly experience.  — End Footnote. — That is why the aim of yogic practice is to turn that prana-current in the inward direction. This is because only when prana is turned inward that delusion is destroyed; [deeper] memory wakes up, and upon the dawning of the Knowledge of the Self, the world becomes bliss-filled. That inner directed movement of prana is indeed that which is “sahaj karma” [the natural act]. It has become gradually directed towards the outer world because of coming into contact with the worldly experience. Srigurudev, at the time of imparting yogic initiation, turns that current in the inner direction, and reveals the Indivisible Spherical “That” Substance. But that change in the [direction of] the current does not stay for very long. Due to the attack of “vikarma” [residual samsaric magnetism], it [the direction of the current] returns [to the world] very soon afterwards. For this reason, one has to do sadhana [dedicated practice] by oneself. In the beginning, quite a lot of effort has to be made in order to turn that current back in the inner direction. It is not pleasant. And in the beginning, that effort does not always “stick”; one gets kicked off because of the magnetism of the worldly experience. That bit of exertion, that effort to stay with it [but not being able to do so] is that which is being called “error.” That is why the Lord is saying, “Even if [the act is done] with errors, ‘sahaj karma’ (moving prana in the inner direction) should not be abandoned.” This is because no act in its beginning stages is without errors. It is covered with errors, like fire being covered with smoke before rising forth.

So goes the basic subject. Srimat Shankaracharya [a sage] says that “sahaj karma” is that which is “svadharma” [see commentary to 18:47 of the Pranab Gita], and Sridharswami [a sage] says that the act ordained from one’s nature is “sahaj karma.” It can be seen from the descriptions from sloka 42 through 48 regarding the ordained duties of the four castes, as well as the meted out fruits of each of those acts that: “the duty born of one’s nature,” “svadharma,” and “sahaj karma” are just different ways of addressing the same thing. Now we have to see why the duties born of the natures of the four castes – such as brahmin-karma, kshatriya-karma etc. – are called “sahaj karma.”
 
Sridharswami says that the act ordained from one’s nature is that which is “sahaj karma.” It can be seen that, along with changes in the human being’s nature (of the physical and mental states), the operation of prana/breath changes – meaning: however the human being’s nature (of the physical and mental states) is at a certain time, the operation of prana/breath follow that. It is as if it is born anew. It is for this reason that the duties ordained from one’s nature is called “sahaj karma.” Even if the prana/breath activity at that time is with errors, one should not relinquish it. If that is done, then there can be troubles. It is like: when, due to the force of grief, the inner wind grows so much that relentless long breaths try to come out, and the tendency to scream out with tears comes about; with the force of fear, the life-breath contracts and trembles the heart, the chest pulsates heavily; when there is joy, the life-breath springs forth and brings laughter and gladness to the face – all of this is the prana/breath’s acts/duties ordained by nature. If all of these acts are abandoned (suppressed), illnesses rise up in the body. In the same way, the operation of prana/breath becomes calm during deep contemplation. Sitting for a long time and doing Kriya does “samjata” [brings stillness] to the prana-current and does “samjata” [makes it unmoving, inert-like] to the body as well. “If at such time one goes to do some work because of becoming restless due to the pull of something, because of not giving the prana-current enough time to flow freely again – if this happens – one spins and falls down.”4 It can be understood from these small examples that however the operation of prana/breath is, starting up due to the active aspects of one’s nature [at that time] – even if that is known to be with errors, it should not be relinquished. Transforming the operation of prana/breath at that time, changing that operation and thus renouncing the [previous] operation is the reasonable way. Now let us see how in the sadhak’s sadhana-life “sahaj karma,” according to his/her nature, changes and in which ways.

“JanmanA jAyate shudrah saṃskArAdvija uchyate” [at birth one is shudra; initiated teachings make one “dvija” [twice born]; so it is said] – from this statement it can be known that for as long as initiation does not take place – meaning: “upanayan” [thread-ceremony analogous to bar/bas mitzvah] – for that long one is in the state of shudra. “Upanayan” [in this case: eye-opening] can also be said to be “inner sight.” With these two eyes of ours there is no seeing of the matters within. That is why, at the time of initiation, Srigurudev opens a divine eye in the middle of our eyebrows. That is what “upanayan” actually is. One cannot see outside with that eye; [but] if one looks within, one can see many things. That eye’s seeing-power is usually covered up. Through practice after receiving initiation, that covering has to be removed. If one is able to remove the covering, past, future, present – all can be seen through that eye. In scriptures, that eye is described/called by many names such as divine eye, third eye, the eye of knowledge, the eye of intuition etc. Because gurudev opens that eye, it is said in the salutation to guru - “chakshurunmeelitaṃ yena tasmai shreegurave namah” [the one who opens the eye – I bow to that guru].
 
Right after initiation-transmission, shudra-ness goes away and “dvija-ness” [the state of the initiated] comes. This initiation-transmission is called “second birth.” One birth is coming to the outer world on the Earth from the womb of the mother. And another birth is the initiation-transmission, by which there is the leaving of the matters of the outer world and seeing the matters of the inner world. Just as: upon taking birth from the womb of the mother, the operation of the life-breath leaves the way of the inner direction and takes up the direction of the outer world – meaning: with birth, that [outgoing operation of prana/breath] is also “born” – in the same way, as one becomes “dvija” via initiation, along with that, the operation of the prana/breath also changes its form, and gradually goes on becoming inner-directed. It is as if that too has a new birth. It also goes on being born along with [more] births, as there are different stages of being “dvija” – such as brahmin etc. – and according to that, this “sahaj Kriya” [natural Kriya] also takes different forms.
 
Just as there are vrittis [active tendencies] related to the worldly experience that rise up due to the outward flow of prana [vital-force], in the same way, along with prana’s movement turning in the inner direction, many different types of vrittis rise up. And according to those, different types of acts have to be performed. All of those acts nourish and make the operation of the life-breath grow. For this reason, those acts are mandatory. Thus, they are also called “sahaj karma” or “the duties ordained from one’s nature.” In the sadhana-life of every sadhak, there is the experiencing – one by one in sequence – of shudra, vaishya, kshatriya and brahmin – these four states. In every state/stage there are distinct acts that are ordained according to operation of prana/breath. All of those acts are not to be relinquished. If they are relinquished, there is no attainment of higher states. It is only by carrying out those acts, one after another, that there can be the rising up to higher states. And due to the fruits of the performance [of the acts], all of those acts gradually fall off, automatically. Otherwise, if one goes to drop them by one’s own will, one falls.
 
The state of not having Kriya is that which is the shudra-state of the sadhak [practitioner]. The “sahaj karma” or the duties ordained from one’s nature in this state is attendance-oriented. Through attendance or service, it nourishes the other three states. Attendance is: keeping the body with clean habits, using the body in appropriate ways and amounts, giving the body moderate amounts of sattvic food, protecting the body from hostile natural elements, keeping an appropriate living space etc – meaning: following [the teachings in] Chapter 6, sloka 17 [of the Bhagavad Gita] in a reasonable way, and taking care of the operations of the body. Because all of these are acts to help reach Liberation, there are no restrictions to this [group of duties]. It is through these acts of attendance that the body has to be made favorable for sadhana [spiritual practice].
 
The state of doing Kriya is the “dvija” [initiate] state of the sadhak. The first stage in Kriya is the sadhak’s vaishya-condition. The second or middle stage is the kshatriya-condition, and the final stage is the brahmin-condition. These are the three stages of sadhana. The natural duties of the first stage [vaishya] is farming, cattle-raising and trade. These three acts go on happening simultaneously from the very beginning of Kriya. In order to understand [the matter] more easily, the three acts are being explained separately.
 
Sitting with “samaṃ kAyashirogreevam” [body, neck and head aligned], using the breathing operation and drawing the downward-directed force in the body upward, and, keeping the spinal column and all of the body steady and firm, reliance has to be made on the Anahata-chakra. Until this posture is properly locked in, the body is, in essence, “plowed” (farmed) with the aid of vital-air; the instabilities of the spinal column are firmly sealed one after the other, and along with that, one has to offer (place) the seed-mantra in the six chakras according to the proper method. All of these acts comprise “farming.” Then there is “gorakshya” [ordinary meaning: cattle raising/herding; spiritual meaning follows]. “Go” means “sense-organs/organs of operation.” The organs are eleven. Five are dedicated to perception; five are dedicated to action; and one other is mind. These organs have to be kept in control. Fixing the anus, sex organ and feet/legs in the appropriate way in a sitting posture, the hands too have to be fixed in jnana-mudra or some other way of locking them according to guru’s instructions, and the tongue has to be turned back and kept in its own place. Using the method in Chapter 6, sloka 16, the organs of perception and mind have to be subordinated and locked into Kutastha between the eyebrows. After doing this, one has to make sure that no organ is struggling or in pain. This is because “sthirasukhAsanam” – the posture must be steady and comfortable. Pain in any place causes problems with Kriya. Through vigilant effort, one has to become well-practiced in posture, because, in sadhana, the posture is like mother. So goes “gorakshya” [“herding” the organs]. Then there is trade. “Trade” means the “business of prana [vital-force].” The gods love prana slathered with Atma-mantra. The sadhak has to go beyond the world. But it is an unknown land. The road to it is covered with darkness. Some support and help is necessary. So, the sadhak takes the help of a gracious great person (guru), learns how to smear mantra on prana, and thereafter, getting information about roads and barriers on the way to the Abode of Brahman, keeping attention fixed on the direction of the destination, and carrying the mantra-smeared prana, goes about doing business with the gods in the six places on the path of mantra. Good quality products bring a good price. As one does, so is that person’s product. If the gods get good quality prana, they become very satisfied, and if they keep receiving the mantra-covered prana on a regular basis, they become very happy. In exchange for prana, they pay in knowledge and illumination; they show the road, and become helpers. Continuing a good relationship in this way, the Supreme Best becomes the profit. This is “trade.” In the first stage of Kriya, these three karmas [vocations] have to be done. Just as the breath goes on flowing naturally on its own, remaining with that, one has to use a method to connect Atma-mantra to that and do business – meaning: uniting the Atma-mantra and “hangsa/hamsa” to each other, one has to perform the operation of prana/breath (pranayam) in the six chakras. There must not be any force applied on the breath. For as long as the student sadhak is not adept in these three karmas [practices], for as long as the posture is not steady, and the tongue has not turned back and gone inside the throat [inner passage], for that long should one do these acts. And for as long as the learned sadhak, while sitting in Kriya, does not feel an ease within, and if the breath is not easy, subtle and strong, and the attention on Kutastha is not steady – for that long should the sadhak do these practices. If these three practices are not done by remaining natural and without putting any kind of force on the breath, no kind of betterment will take place whatsoever. And if one abandons this way of doing these practices, and one, right from the beginning, puts pressure on the breath and tries to use forceful energy, because all of the paths of the nadis [subtle pathways] are not clean and clear [yet], the force of the vital-air will go to those places, and finding blocks, will disrupt and distort those [places/nadis] and cause illness on the body. The first stage of Kriya is gentle practice. Many, thinking that this gentle sadhana in the first stage is incorrect, try to do sadhana intensely in their own way, without having practiced [the gentle way]. They put pressure on the breath, they forcefully control the breath, make it long, stop it – meaning: they try to do the karma [method] of the second stage of Kriya. The consequence is that they get the opposite results. They end up with deranged afflictions of the head and body and such. That is why [it is said]: “sahajaṃ karma kaunteya sadoShamapi na tyajet” [O Kaunteya [Arjuna], the natural karma [act], even with errors, should not be relinquished], etc.
 
When the karma [aggregate of different practices] of this first stage of Kriya becomes mastered, and breath automatically becomes, subtle, long and powerful, then the student sadhak receives the second Kriya from guru, and the learned sadhak becomes engaged in the practice of the middle stage of Kriya. This middle stage is indeed the “kshatriya condition” of the sadhak. The natural karma [active attributes] of this stage are valiance, energy/power, steadfastness, skill, not fleeing from battle, generosity, and being in the state of “lord.” This stage is the intensely difficult stage of the sadhak. Having cleared up all of the nadis from the practices of the first stage, the sadhak has to, [only] according to guru’s instructions, apply force on the breath. The vital-air has to be moved through different nadis. With the help of inner strength, the pains of sadhana have to be tolerated. Applying adeptness and skill, and taking the help of discrimination, detachment and such, one has to stop the powerful attacks of lust, anger greed and such – the supporters of the desirous worldly experiences. In no way should one retreat. By doing Kriya in this way, lust, anger and such – all such are conquered. And gradually, many places in the kingdom of this body come under one’s control. Many types of powers are attained. [But] when powers are attained, one must not become attached to them and [must not] enjoy them. Enjoyment brings bondage. Ascension does not happen. While remaining totally unattached to everything, one has to offer everything to the Lord and go on. This is “charity/generosity.” This remaining unattached and not falling into the bondage of enjoyment – due to this, the Influence of the Self spreads all over the powers of Prakriti. This is the state of “lord.” The [Bhagavad] Gita’s sadhak Arjuna is engaged in this Kriya of the middle stage. Seeing the difficult nature of this intense duty to be done, he decides that the karma [duties] of the final stage of Kriya is better. That is quite a peaceful state (meaning: Sahasrar Kriya, learned from guru’s mouth). In that state, there is no relationship to the five elements. The mind stays in the Knowledge-filled Bliss of Brahman in the Sahasrar. No efforts of the six chakras remain at all. Not even rulership remains. Having what it has always desired, the mind is content. Having this “being content upon having the desired thing” in mind, Arjuna says, “shreyobhoktuṃ bhaikshyamapeeha loke” [better to eat from begging for alms in this world]. That Arjuna is trying to go to the state of Knowledge by abandoning the state of karma [yogic practice] – that wish of his is useless. The reason is: without performing that intense karma, one cannot stay in that state of Knowledge. One has to come down because of still being under the power of Prakriti, and thus one has to, with absolute certainty, engage in action. The reason for this [Bhagavad] Gita is verily to understand this.
 
The Lord is saying “sahajaṃ karma kaunteya sadoShamapi na tyajet” [O Kaunteya [Arjuna], the natural karma [act], even with errors, should not be relinquished]. In this middle stage of sadhana, the sadhak is looking at Kutastha Chaitanya, and is standing between the two groups of vrittis [good and bad active attributes]. [Arjuna’s] road is completely clear. The bow has been drawn – meaning: the spinal column has been made as steady and straight as possible. With that, a sharp arrow is also attached there – meaning: the breath within the spine has become subtle and intense/quickened. Now, that can be shot anywhere, unobstructed, and one can pierce whatever one wants. In this state, there is no other action to do other than valiance/heroism, power and such. That is actually the “sahaj karma” of this time. Now, if the sadhak does not use that intense/quickened subtle breath in the appropriate way through valiance and power and such, and, upon abandoning that, goes to perform brahmin-karma at the Sahasrar, that is not going to be possible. This is because the Kriya of that intense/subtle breath has now begun, and cannot be ended without going through it. One cannot relinquish karma [duty; or: action and its fruit] by just wishing to relinquish karma. Because of the power of Prakriti, one will be compelled helplessly to be bound even more to the actions born of one’s nature. It is only through performing Kriya in a detached way that karma [all meanings of the word] is relinquished automatically. Using desire only brings bondage. Emancipation does not happen. That is why the Lord says later, “kartṛm necchhasi yanmohAt karShyasyavasho’pi tat” [you will be helplessly made to do that out of attachment]. For this reason, He is teaching now that one should, with unattached mind at all times, do all duties, and worship God [while doing the duties]. It is when that is done that perfection will be attained. One should not abandon “sahaj karma” [natural yoga] even if it is with errors. This is because that is the only path of ascension. Just as the only way to prepare the necessary rice and such is with fire/heat, but in order to light that fire the natural smoke will appear without fail, just as that fire is not something to be abandoned regardless of that [smoke] – in the same way, all acts are covered with errors in the beginning stages. Therefore, even if “sahaj karma” is with errors, it is not something to be abandoned.
 
The moving of prana is the activity with which the jiva [person] is born. Just because it [the activity] has mingled with the worldly experience and has become erroneous, that does not mean that this activity is to be abandoned. Just as smoke covers fire – in the same way, because of the errors coming forth from (the contact with) the starting up of “sarva” [all – meaning: phenomena], the door to the true nature of this karma [particular duty] in the path of Brahman is being kept covered. Just as when the fire gains a little strength, the smoke is chased away and the fire’s own form is revealed – similarly the activity with which one is born too, traveling on the guru-revealed path, casts away the web of Prakritic Maya, and places oneself in one’s True Being."
49,"The person who has unattached mind in all things, who is free of pride, and is without desire attains the supreme non-doing perfection through sannyas.","Previously, the Lord has said that human beings attain perfection if they worship God. How that work that is one’s own is to be carried out, and what kind of perfection will be attained – in order to teach that, He is saying that one should perform all actions with an unattached mind at all times/everywhere. One should worship with a vanquished ego and without desire. If that happens, then the supreme non-doing perfection – meaning: one will attain the purification of one’s essence in the form of the relinquishing of the fruits of actions – meaning: the one whose intellect does not conclude that children and home and such make up the essence of life, [the one for whom] through special Kriya, the mind, intellect and chitta [personal consciousness] is under one’s control, the one who has no rising up of any kind of desire from having affection towards enjoyment – that is the one who, through sannyas (the destruction of “sarva” [ordinary meaning: “all”; meaning in the Pranab Gita: the whole of the worldly experience]), attains the supreme non-doing perfection (the Settledness in Brahman) (see Chapter 3, sloka 4). "
50,"O Kaunteya [Arjuna]! The way that human beings attain Brahman after attaining perfection, which (the attainment of Brahman) is the highest state of knowledge (the final completion) – know about that in a summarized way from Me.","Upon engaging in extremely challenging discipline, and going on practicing the happiness of being in contact with Brahman, a great openness takes over. In that, all of the activities of the senses together with the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] that are carried out while living in this body of nine doors – those activities can no longer find a place in the openness to hold fast. Like coming in one door and going out another, those go out and end up somewhere far from the antahkarana. Thus, no operative power from those can rise up in the antahkarana. The unabated abidance in that activity-free antahkarana is indeed the sadhak’s attainment of non-doing. Just as unattachedness is ever the state in Brahman, it is also so in this sadhak. The attainment of Brahman that is in this way – that is the final completion of knowledge. O son of Kunti [Arjuna], the practices through which this state becomes settled – I will tell you now in summary. Listen. (Chapter 5, sloka 13 [of the Bhagavad Gita].)"
"51,52,53","With purified (sattvic) intellect, stilling that intellect with steadfastness, abandoning all worldly experiences such as sound etc., relinquishing affection and repulsion (related to such worldly experiences), and then being solitary in dwelling, eating moderately, having controlled speech, body and mind, and constantly being devoted to the yoga of meditation, and thereafter taking full recourse in detachment, and thus fully relinquishing egotism, forcefulness, arrogance, lust, anger and possession, and being unselfish – the person attains supreme peace and is fit to become Brahman ([fit to] immovably be established in the Knowledge “I Am Brahman”).","The one whose intellect has been purified – meaning: ignores all except for the Self Itself and does not take anything else on; the one whose steadfastness is not on anything else except one’s Self; the one for whom the body-vanity/body-identification is controlled (under his/her power) – meaning: even if distracted, the memory of “body is ‘I’” does not arise; the one in whom the worldly experiences such as sound etc. only operate to just carry on the sustenance of the body – they do not do anything else beyond that; “raga” = affection; “dvesha” = non-affection/repulsion – the one from whom these have completely left; the one who always experiences solitude of empty places, banks of rivers, mountains, cremation grounds in his/her inner being – meaning: rising up from the Muladhar and piercing the Ajna-chakra, that being only moves about in the middle of the brahmanadi – the one who is not enwrapped by the contact with anything whatsoever of the chitra, vajra or sushumna [all nadis [subtle passageways in the body]] ([this is] “living in solitary places”); the one who eats light meals, or the one whose hopes (the desires for having) are light – meaning: does not want anything except Brahman alone; the one whose speech, body and the functionalities of mind are “yata” [controlled] – meaning: [the functionalities of mind] have let go of their own activities; the non-desirous settledness that happens after the ending of thought – meaning: upon merging with Brahman – the thing to be united with – the abidance that is there with attaining that Form – the one who is ever in that (engaged); the one who has no desire for any enjoyment of this world or the next world; and the one who has relinquished [the following]: ego = the vanity of “me-ness”; forcefulness = the power to grasp any Prakritic substance ([in actuality] non-substance); arrogance = the tendency to be “big” by doing a lot of “digging”; lust = thinking in the direction of the worldly experience; anger = the active functionality that arises when the desired thing is taken away [or: cannot be obtained]; possession = to get more than what is necessary – this kind of unselfish (meaning: the one who does not take up anything that can be said to be “mine” – that one), peaceful, steady sadhak is the one who is fit to attain Brahman."
54,"The cheerful-minded person residing in Brahman does not grieve (over lost/destroyed things), does not hanker (after non-procurable things), and, being the same in all things/situations, attains the supreme devotion to Me. ","The one who has experienced the happiness from the contact with Brahman in samadhi-oneness in the earlier previously-mentioned way – that person is called “brahmavid” [knower of Brahman] or “brahmabhoot” [residing in Brahman]. “Prasannatma” = “pra” = in every way; “sanna” = going – the one who is moving about in the Self in every way – meaning: at the time of abiding in the Self, the one in whom no kind of Mayic impressions spring up – that is the one who is called “prasannatma.” No grief [comes] to the antahkarana of these sadhaks [spiritual practitioners] who are in this state – meaning: the operative power of chitta [personal consciousness] is not active, and [no] hankering – meaning: other than Brahman, no lust to get any Mayic things remains. Because of being in waveless settledness, no shockwave arises. Thus, [at this time,] not having the perception of whether all phenomena exist or not, and as One remains present, the fruit attained through having unmoving faith in guru’s words – that “I Am Brahman” – that being attains that very thing (Chapter 6, sloka 32; Chapter 7, sloka 16)."
55,"Through (that supreme) devotion, the way that I am (all-pervading) and the form [that I am] (the deepest Existence-Consciousness-Bliss) – [that person] truly knows Me in that way. After that, knowing Me truly, when that knowledge comes to its peak, [that being] enters Me.","The separate and many “I”-s that you are seeing that I have created from the titled/attributed versions of the “I-aham” – upon having unmoving faith in guru’s words and practicing Kriya, and thereby continuously washing the space of personal consciousness, when all of those separate “I”-s are erased, upon knowing the [Reality that is] all-title-free, devoid of duality and non-duality, One Essence, Deep Consciousness, Primal, Unconquerable, Immortal, Infinite, and knowing that there is no place for a second “I” besides this “I”, the sadhak will be free of doubts. It is then that the sadhak will “mAmabhijAnati” [come to know Me] – meaning: in the form of the knower of the field, one will oneself see Oneself. There will be no place in the antahkarana for an opposing situation/perception. Wherever there is whatever amount of water – all of that is in the bosom of the sea. The recognition of separateness in the separate selves will not be there. The illusion of substances, Prakriti, Maya etc. will completely disappear. Know that this is that which is “tattvatojnAtvA” [having known in truth]. After this, the sadhak proceeds to gradually become the Expanse. It is like: I have my feet in two boats. As soon as I take my foot off of one boat, I immediately take refuge in one boat alone. It is like this."
56,"Even if he/she is doing all kinds of activities, the person who has taken refuge in Me, attains the Eternal, Inexhaustible State as My Blessing.","I Am Vasudeva Brahman, the recourse of all, yet I am free of any recourse. All of the actions of this “I” are also devoid of recourse. That is why I am saying that: however many actions there may be, if one does them without taking recourse [in anything], and just stays locked [in the Self] – the Eternal, Inexhaustible State that comes about due to this “I” being appeased – that, due to practice, spontaneously/automatically comes into being."
57,"Through the sense of discrimination, surrender all actions to Me, and having surrendered to Me, take recourse in “buddhi-yoga,” and keep your mind on Me.","The 12 causalities/factors that have been previously spoken about in sloka 14 [of Chapter 18 of the Bhagavad Gita] – whatever is done in/with those causalities/factors – that is what is called “sarva karma” [all actions]. Throwing all of those karmas in the personal consciousness [the highest position in the antahkarana], cause the causalities/factors and karmas from below to not exist. The lack of causalities/factors and karma [action] is that which is called “buddhi-yoga.” After [the application of] “buddhi-yoga,” only the impressions of the aggregate of karmas [actions] remain in the field of personal consciousness. Via personal consciousness, throwing those impressions of karmas in “I” burns up the impressions of karmas. After the impressions of karmas burn up, the chitta [personal consciousness] [becomes] “Chit” [Universal Consciousness] – meaning: falls into “I” and [“chitta”] becomes “chit” [lays down flat]; [alternate translation: becomes “Chit” [capital “C”; Universal Consciousness]. That is why I am saying that you, upon simply taking recourse in “buddhi-yoga,” and after throwing all karmas with the help of chitta into “I”, and destroying them, remain in contemplation of Me [or: remain in My Consciousness] unbrokenly."
58,"As you contemplate on Me, from my Blessings, you will pass over all obstacles (all of the impassable sufferings of samsara). And if you, [put yourself] under the power of egotism and do not listen (to My words), then you will perish.","It is when personal consciousness comes into “I” that one gets My Blessings. The chitta [personal consciousness] enjoying My Blessings is that which is called “macchitta” [mind on Me; or: mind in My Consciousness]. In this state, you will pass over “sarvadurga” [all phenomenal obstacles] – meaning: the shadow that had come over the impure personal consciousness when it is facing creation – because of personal consciousness now being pure, that barrier made by that shadow will be cut apart. Thus, the errors of contact from the seed of samsara will end. You will become Free. You will go beyond Maya. And if you take recourse in egotism, and do not listen to this teaching, if you do not take it [this teaching] in, then you will die – meaning: you will go on experiencing birth and death. "
59,"This that you are thinking – “I will not do battle” – because of having taken recourse in egotism – this business (endeavor) of yours is absolutely false (worthless), because Prakriti will force you to (be engaged in) battle. ",If you take recourse in egotism and think that you will not do battle (Kriya) and sit about like that – that will not work for you. You are kshatriya. Your nature will not let you go without doing battle (Kriya). You yourself will not be able to remain [like this] without doing it [battle; Kriya].
60,"O Kaunteya [Arjuna]! You are bound to doing the karma [ordained acts] of yours, which are born of your nature. That which you are not willing to do because being under the power of delusion – that you will do, even helplessly [against your will]. ","As one’s nature is – that one is bound to do the karma [ordained acts] according to that. Even if one has no desire to do so because of falling into the delusion of non-discernment, that person’s nature will helplessly (by force) make one do that. Thus, the desire that Arjuna has – that he will not do battle – that is false [useless]. This is because the nature of kshatriya, with which he was born, will not leave him. According to the desire of the Lord – the Ordainer of the fruits of karma, that [karma] will become strong in the appropriate time, will compel him [Arjuna] helplessly and the karma [duty] born of his nature will defeat the desire and will definitely engage him in battle. If that karma born of one’s own nature is carried out willingly, the bondage to karma [all meanings of the word] is destroyed. And if one does it unwillingly, and is forced helplessly by one’s nature, that bondage becomes even more tangled. It is for this reason that the Lord has said, just a bit previously, “svakrmaNA tamabhyArchya siddhiṃ vindati mAnavah” [worshipping while carrying out one’s own karma [duty], the human being comes to know perfection], and in Chapter 11 He has said, “nimittamAtraṃ bhava savyasAchin” [you are only an instrument, O ambidextrous archer] (see the commentary to this [sloka 11:33 of the Bhagavad Gita]).

How this “helplessly being forced to do an undesired work” is – let me explain this with the example of an experience in Kriya. The sadhak who has gone through this will know. To sleep at night is in our nature from birth. So, one thinks that one will not sleep, and that Kriya must be done all night. Resolving to do this, the mind begins to do Kriya with great enthusiasm. Not too long afterwards, a kind of standstill state comes in Kriya spontaneously, and the mind’s enthusiasm diminishes a bit. At that time, one’s own nature rises up in the mind. It somehow spreads itself over the mind. The mind becomes subservient to it. Then [one’s nature] goes on giving the mind a reasoning that says, “Oh, so I have conquered it. If one just wants to do Kriya, one can easily do it all night. Kriya will have to be done all night. There will not be any sleeping at all. But, Kriya has been performed for quite a while now. If I just lie down for a minute or so and ease up the stiffness of the body, it will be good. And right after one minute, I will get up and Kriya will be started up again.” This kind of advice and reasoning then becomes irrefutable to the mind in just a few moments. How irrefutable this becomes – the one who has suffered this – that is the one who will understand.  Laying down just for one minute according to that reasoning – then – done! All practice is washed out. One’s nature is fully victorious. Deep sleep completely envelops [the sadhak]. All is wasted! After waking, there is the regret, “Oh my, oh my, why did I lie down?!” This is why there is the injunction of “yuktasvapnAvabodha” [having a reasonable amount of sleep [which allows] alertness during the waking state]. One has to sleep. Go ahead and willingly lay down and sleep. Then get up. After getting up, do Kriya. If one does like this, gradually sleep will be conquered. Otherwise, if one says, “I will not sleep at all” – why would one’s nature leave one? It will overcome one and put one to sleep for sure. And with that, all of that effort will be lost, and one will just experience regret. That is why the Lord is telling Arjuna, again and again, “svakarmaNya tamabhyarchya siddhiṃ vindati mAnavah” – meaning: by performing the duty born of one’s nature and worshipping God by that, one attains perfection. Gradually, one transcends one’s nature, and one becomes self-empowered. This is why the Lord is telling Arjuna in this sloka [18:60]: “You are still bound by the karma [duty] born of your own nature. You have not been able to transcend your nature yet. So, even if there is no desire to do the natural duty, your nature will make you do it. Therefore, stay under the power of your nature, with the mind being unattached to everything, and go on doing Kriya. Your nature will automatically change.” "
61,"O Arjuna! The Lord, through the illusory power of Maya, causes all beings/phenomena to revolve as if mounted on a machine, and He resides in the hearts of all beings/phenomena. (Or: The Lord, who is making all that are mounted on the machine in the form of body – meaning: all of the living beings who are with body-vanity/body-identification – revolve through Maya, is residing in the hearts of all beings/phenomena.) ","In the previous two slokas [verses] [18:59 and 18:60], the Lord spoke about the mechanisms of Prakriti controlling someone/something and the mechanisms of one’s nature controlling someone/something according to Sankhya and such [perspectives]. Now, in this sloka [18:61], He is revealing His own view. He is saying, “All beings/phenomena are instruments of God.” Residing in the hearts of all beings/phenomena, God, through Maya, is making all beings/phenomena revolve. The essential meaning of slokas 59, 60, 61 [all from Chapter 18 of the Bhagavad Gita] is this. O Arjuna! Firstly, you are under Prakriti’s power – meaning: due to the fruits of previously done actions, whatever is going on happening, as well as the kind of structure with which your body is built – you, at the time of acting, are certainly bound to doing actions according to that state of being. Besides that, the way that you have made your body and mind become accustomed to following habits from birth – doing actions other than those habitual actions and actions born of your own nature is impossible for you to do. You are bound to that. Even if you do not want to do it, you will have to do it helplessly against your will. Not only is it absolutely true that the jiva [being] is bound to actions that are of Prakriti and born of one’s own nature, besides that, that Lord Who is the Ordainer of the fruits of actions – it is He Who is Desire-filled. It is by the power of His Desire or Maya that the operations of whatever there is in creation are going on. It is from Him that the beings/phenomena come forth, and by Whom all of this is being pervaded. Him – the One Who resides within all, pervades all, the Person in all hearts – residing in all in the form of the active force, from Brahmaa [the creator] to the end of inert matter – all things, and thereby engaging all beings/phenomena, living and non-living, to their own particular actions. That active force to do works is verily His Maya. Who can escape His Maya? That is overpowering. One has to work under its power. Therefore, you have no escape in any direction. You cannot remain without doing this Prakritic karma [actions]. Therefore (He is saying in the next sloka [18:62]) you “tameva sharanaṃ gacchha” [go surrender unto Him]; take refuge in Him. It is only through His beneficence that you will attain Supreme Peace. You will not get peace by your trying to go to the end of actions by saying, “It is better to eat by begging for alms.”
 
Dear sadhak! Take a look here at your own sadhana [spiritual practice]. In your path of sadhana you travel about in the five chakras such as Muladhar etc. in these five elements: earth, water, fire, air, ether. These are [what is called] “all phenomena.” God, Supreme Self, Supreme God – is in the heart-land of this “all phenomena” – meaning: resides exactly in the center-area of the chakras. The Brahman-space that is inside the sushumna-vajra-chitra [nadis] within the five chakras such as Muladhar etc. – that which is called “brahmanadi” – that is that which is the manifestation of Brahman within “all phenomena.” That is that which is “God.” It is with Its Lordship or Rulership, with Its Recourse, or because of Its Existence that the five elements are carrying out their own particular actions according to each of their dharmas [natures]. And so, the center-area of each of the five chakras of earth, water etc. is actually Kutastha. But because all Kutasthas are of the same thread and are connected to the center of the Ajna-chakra, and because the Enchantress Prakriti’s attractive power is stronger below the Ajna, there is the “ajna” [directive] to keep attention steady on “Ajna[-chakra].” That is why when the word “Kutastha” is used, it means that center-area of the Ajna-chakra. By keeping attention on that Kutastha within the Ajna, and being able to do Kriya according to injunctions, with the mind coming and going in the hearts of all of the heart-lands of “all phenomena” – meaning: within the brahmanadi – is “taking shelter in Him in all ways.”
 
“God is revolving [beings/phenomena] through His Maya” – this being said – Who is this “God”? And what even is “Maya”? Maharshi Patanjali [author of the Yoga Sutras] says, “kleshakarmavipAkAshayairaparAmṛShTah puruShavisheSha eeshvarah” [the one who is untouched by afflictions, karma [duties; actions], post-consuming conditions, and the receptacle of impressions – that special being is “Ishvara” [God]] – meaning: the One Who cannot be touched by the five afflictions such as ignorance etc., karma [dutiful acts] in the forms of righteous and unrighteous ones, the post-consuming condition in the form of fruits of karma [previous actions], and the gathered impressions from the fruits in the chitta [personal consciousness] (“ashaya” [receptacle]) – that Special Person is “Ishvara” [God]. Dear sadhak! What these five afflictions such as “avidya” [ignorance] are – know them.
 
(1) “Avidya” [ignorance]. What is not the thing [being perceived] – that which makes one think that [the wrong perception is true] and brings full faith in that knowledge – that is “avidya.” Like: this creation is impermanent (that which goes away, that which has mutations or change – that is that which is “impermanent”). But it seems to the mind that it [the creation] is permanent and unchanging. Your body has been changing since infancy and has become old – this is mutation/change. And that infancy, childhood, pre-teen period, teenage, youth, and mature-adult states have died (and they will not come back). Yet, you are thinking: “I am growing up. It is as if I am immortal.” This delusional knowledge or false knowledge is called “avidya.”
 
(2) “Asmita” [ordinary meaning: egotism; deeper meaning follows]. That which makes one believe that two completely different things are the same exact thing – that is that which is called “asmita.” Like: the Being is Consciousness and the Enjoyer, and the intellect-essence is material; it is the object of enjoyment. These two are very different things. Even so, that which makes one perceive both as the same – that is that which is “asmita.” This “asmita” is that which is the “heart-knot,” where the two very different things – “I” and “mine” – are continuously thought to be the same due to the power of delusion.
 
(3) “Raga” [affection]. Somewhere I ate a sweet and got pleasure. To want to have that satisfaction of that sweet-eating again – that is that which is “raga” – meaning: the desirous feeling towards – or the hankering for – the enjoyment of the worldly experience.
 
(4) “Dvesha” [repulsion; hatred]. After experiencing a painful experience once – whenever that comes to mind – the feeling of repulsion towards that experience that comes about – meaning: one does not want to experience that again – when this vritti [active condition] arises – that is that which is called “dvesha.”
 
(5) “Abhinivesh” [fear born of a previous cause; fear of death]. I have died in previous lives. I have experienced a very great suffering in those deaths. Because this impression is in the personal consciousness, if someone says “die” – the faint memory of that previously experienced suffering that gathers up fear in the mind/heart – that is called “abhinivesh.” These are the five afflictions.
 
The righteous and unrighteous actions are called “karma.” (See the commentary regarding “karma” in Chapter 8 [of the Pranab Gita].) The fruit of karma is “vipak” [the post-experience/post-consuming condition]. The fruits born of karma that are engraved in the personal consciousness – that is that which is called “ashaya” [receptacle of impressions] or “samskara” [latent impressions].
 
The One Who cannot be touched by these, the One Who is this kind of unattached – that Special Person is called “Ishvara” [God]. He is with gunas/attributes, but is not connected to the operations of the gunas. That is His Specialness. He is Satchitananda [Existence-Consciousness-Bliss] Itself.
 
What Maya is – let us now try to understand that. Ishvara [God] is Desire-filled. His very power of Desire is called “Maya.” Thus, Maya too is desire-filled. This desire-power or Maya is “Avyakta” [inexpressible]. Her form cannot be expressed by speaking about it, because whatever you say will become naught. Nothing will be able to be understood. “Ma” – is a negation-meaning sound, and “ya” - is an existence-meaning sound. That which happens with the union of these two meanings – that is that which is “Maya” – meaning: something that is beyond discernment.
 
The real form of Maya cannot be understood. It/She is inexpressible. But through inference from observing Her activities, the sages have given some works-based names that show the nature of Maya. Like: “sA mAyA pAlinee shaktih sṛShTi saṃhArkAriNee” [that Maya is the ruling power, the cause of the dissolution of creation], “aghaTanpaTiyasee” [who makes that which has not happened [or: does not happen] happen], “sA mAheshvaree shaktih jnAnaroopAtilAlasA vyomasaṃjnA parAkAShThA” [that Supreme Goddess Power is knowledge Herself and desirousness, conscious in the ethers and is the supreme destination] etc. Just as: energy, or that substance, is unseen and no description can be given to it. But when that unseen energy or that substance becomes concentrated and materialized, it becomes expressed and fire comes about; the burning-power comes into being, and with its use, force manifests within substances. The atomic/molecular connections in liquid substances are dispersed and the fundamental elements are separated from each other, and all of the substances become heated etc. It is through such types of activities that whatever can be understood about energy is understood. Similarly: through activities related to Maya, the causal aspect is formed/assumed [in perception]. From this [observation], it can be understood that Maya is endowed with three gunas [primal qualities] – meaning: is Herself the operating power of emergence, sustenance and dissolution. The active state of Maya is Prakriti [phenomenal nature].
 
When this Maya remains merged in Brahman in a state of non-doing – at that time She is “Brahmi Shakti” [Power in Brahman]. The word “anna” [sustenance] means “Brahman,” the “Complete”; that Shakti, Who has Her refuge in that Completeness, is also Complete and thus has the name “Annapurna” [Complete Sustainer].  In the state of non-doing, there is no manifestation of Shakti [Power]. Thus, at that time, She is also “vibhu” (pervading all forms). As soon as She takes up the vritti [active functionality] in the direction of creation, right then the name “Shakti” (birth-giver) is given. Wherever there is Shakti, there is activity. Just as activity begins, right then does the name “Prakriti” happen. Prakriti gave birth to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; all are separate, fragments, with a sense of “many.” The cessation or retraction of this many-ness is dissolution, prana/life or the void (0). “Birth” – meaning: creation – is expressed, and “consuming/swallowing” – meaning: dissolution – is inexpressible. The names of these two are “birth” and “death.” Those that are born – they are “sarva” [all] (whatever there is). And those that die – they are the ones who are “bhoot” [past] (whatever is gone). (The unexpressed state of “sarva” is “bhoot.” And the expressed state of “bhoot[s]” is “sarva.”) Even if this appears as a change to the eyes of the ignorant, to the eyes of the knowledgeable ones there is only One Brahman that is present, Who is Brahman Itself and the Expanse.
 
That unattached Ishvara, upon mixing with the guna-endowed Maya (the false), and (dressing up as “Brahman with attributes”), and upon residing in the hearts of that “sarva bhoot” (in the middle), is making them be under the power of the cycle of time in the form of birth and death, and is making them revolve.
 
This Desire-filled Ishvara has created this cosmos-universe through the influence of His Desire – meaning: it is He Who has taken on the form of this universe. Just as one seed alone gives birth to a tree, and hundreds of seeds come forth from that tree – in the same way, this universe-tree has come forth from the One Lord, and many living beings have come forth in/from the universe-tree. The Seed of the universe is Ishvara [God]. The universe is a mutation of Maya. And the seeds born in/from the universe are jivas [individual beings]. Just from one Seed of Desire innumerable seeds come forth. Thus, just as God is Desire-filled, so is the jiva [person]. The difference is that God is the refuge of that Desire-Power, and the jiva is the one being sheltered by the Desire-Power – covered in the abyss of Maya. Maya is desirousness itself, action itself, and knowledge itself. To sum it up, Maya is endowed with desirousness, action and knowledge. When Maya, through being transmuted, dresses up as the universe – the Prakriti that is endowed with the 24 elements – then the current of this desirousness-action-knowledge flows. From that desirousness arise: action, the fruits of action, the samsara of action, and the distorted Prakritic consciousness, or the five afflictions. All of these innumerable seeds in the form of jivas that are coming forth from the power of that desirousness – these are structured by those afflictions, actions, post-consuming conditions and impressions in the receptacle of personal consciousness. Ishvara is untouched by all of those.
 
Ishvara has two states – “saguna” [with attributes] and “nirguna” [without attributes]. The nirguna state is called “Brahman.” At that time [of nirguna], Maya or the Desire-power remains one [with Brahman], like butter in milk – meaning: the non-active state. The saguna state is the active state, which is when Maya manifests. The saguna state is “Ishvara” [God being apparent]. Upon going into the state of manifesting, Maya mutates, and that mutation of Maya is that which transforms into the 24 elements and the aggregate of afflictions, actions, post-consuming conditions and the receptacle of impressions. Ishvara is untouched by the mutations of Maya. In the saguna state, Ishvara, being connected with the manifestations of Maya, is the ordainer of the fruits of actions that have come forth from the mutations of Maya. He is Himself Immutable and Non-diminishing. The jivas have come forth from Ishvara; thus, they are desire-endowed. And in that too, the self-determined free will is active. The kinds of actions that the jiva encounters because of applying his/her self-determined free will – the jiva experiences the results/consequences according to that. Those resultant fruits are ordained by that residing Omnipresent Ishvara Who is within all beings. This means: even if one is moving according to one’s own will, the jiva is helplessly forced by the Will of God or Maya to experience the fruits of actions that have been done. For as long as the jiva will go on under the power of his own free will in the path of the worldly experience – for that long will his/her karma [actions bearing fruits] definitely go on being created, and he/she will have to experience the fruits of all of that karma. If the jiva abandons his/her sense of self-determination, turns around that current of independent will and desirousness, puts attention on that Ishvara, and takes refuge in Himself alone, then the jiva will receive the Blessings of Ishvara – as the fruit of that karma [act] of surrendering. The jiva will attain the state of Ishvara, and control Prakriti. The jiva will attain the state of lordship, and will be untouched by those afflictions, actions, post-consuming conditions and the receptacle of impressions. That is the State of Peace – the State of Emancipation. That is why, the Lord is telling Arjuna in the next sloka [18:62], “tameva sharaNaṃ gacchha sarvabhAvena bhArata” [O Bharata [Arjuna], go surrender unto Him in all ways]. — Begin Footnote. — Many people say, “Whatever God is making me do, I am doing only that. What is sin and virtue in that? I am nothing at all. He is verily all.” In one way the statement sounds good, showing signs of devotion. But going to the end of seeing that side, it shows ignorance. Why did creation take place? What is God’s purpose for creation? Why did the actions of sin and virtue come about? “There is no need at this time to argue about ‘why’ and ‘what.’ Whatever God is making us do, we are doing just that. He is even operating the current of thoughts.” This statement is not right. This is because jiva is not self-created; it is not like it has no godly state or godly qualities. The essence of the jiva is not separate from God. In Vedanta it is said, “jeevah brahmaiva kevalam” [the jiva [individuated being] is only Brahman Itself]. The jiva is created as the active effect of the Cause. In the world, it is seen that one type of seed does not produce different types of seeds. From rice there is rice; from barley there is barley; and similarly, from the seed of the animal there is the animal; from the seed of the human there is the human. This has always been so. The relationship of the manifestation to the Cause is always there. In all jivas, it is seen that all seem to desire to live in a state of independence, as well as to work in a state of independence. From where does this desire for independence come? It is here that one has to understand the relationship between the manifested and the Cause. The Cause is the Lord of creation – God, Who controls Prakriti and is Himself Independent. That “independence aspect” of His spreads actively and is “born” [within the jiva] along with the jiva’s birth in the womb of Prakriti. The womb of Prakriti is the kingdom of action. Because the jiva is covered with afflictions, actions, post-consuming conditions and the receptacle of impressions in this kingdom of action, it cannot remain without performing action. Action takes place by the operation of that active aspect of the desire to be independent. God locks the jiva in the fruits of those actions and makes the jiva experience the fruits of those actions. Because this functionality of independence is present, the Lord is teaching Arjuna “svakarmanah tamabhyarchya siddhiṃ vindati mAnavah” [worshipping while carrying out one’s own karma [duty], the human being comes to know perfection] – meaning: while going on experiencing God’s ordained fruits of one’s own ordained actions (the fruits of actions that have been done), one must operate one’s free will, and thereby take up intellectual discernment and, through that, worship Him. If that is done, then there is the attainment of perfection – meaning: by piercing the veil of the afflictions, actions, post-consuming conditions and impressions in the receptacle of personal consciousness – those that are stated by Patanjali – one will attain the State of Independence – the State of Emancipation. If it were like this: that the jiva does not have the functionality of independent will, that the jiva is just a toy, like a puppet, in the hands of God, then the Lord would not have given such a teaching [as is in the Bhagavad Gita]. He Himself would have made [the acts] happen. That is not so. And God is Impartial/Indifferent. He does not have “one’s own” and “not one’s own”; He does not have a sense of good and bad. In the saguna state, He is the form of action and the Ordainer of the fruits of action. It is in that form of being the Ordainer of the fruits of actions that He is making the jiva dance about in the experiencing of the fruits of actions. For as long as the ignorant jiva does not understand this dancing about – for that long does the jiva dance about. Then, upon becoming aware and understanding, the jiva right away grabs a hold of Him. (By grabbing a hold of Him, the jiva gets released from that dancing about, from the madness of the world, and attains Peace.) — End Footnote. —"
62,"O Bharata [Arjuna]! Take Him as your shelter in every way. By His kindness, you will attain Supreme Peace and the Eternal Abode. ","O Bharata [Arjuna; the sadhak]! (“Bha” = engaged in radiance.) O awakened one! Whenever and however much you interact with those “sarva” [see commentary to sloka 18:61 of the Pranab Gita] – all of that is the divine-power Prakriti with gunas [primal qualities]. Discern Prakriti, the mutations of Prakriti and the works from the permutations of Prakriti; do not mix with them; and with a natural movement take recourse in the path of Brahman located in the heart-area, and go forward to merge with Kutastha Chaitanya Ishvara. When this practice of yours goes from deep to deepest, then – the Supreme Peace and Settledness in Brahman that is in the “shashvata” [eternal] (Imperishable) Substance – you will get that.

“Sharanaṃ gacchha” [go unto surrender] in this sloka [verse] and “yathecchhasi tathA kuru” [do as you please] in sloka 63 [of Chapter 18 of the Bhagavad Gita] – through these two statements, the Lord is quite clearly teaching that even though the jiva is an instrument of Prakriti, an instrument of one’s own nature, and an instrument of the Lord, he/she has free will regarding the matters of desire. That is why, through using the term “tameva” [unto Him verily], the Lord is having Arjuna look at “mam” [Me; I] in statements such as “mAmeva ye prapadyante mAyAm etAṃ taranti te” [surrendering unto Me, this Maya can certainly be crossed] and “mAmekAṃ sharanaṃ vraja” [go surrender unto Me alone], and then, through the words “gacchha” [go] and “kuru” [do], He is giving the teachings about taking up the necessary effort in spiritual practice via competent Kriya. "
63," I now gave you the teaching on the knowledge that is deeper than the deepest secret. Upon contemplating this fully, do as you please. ","What has been said about the jiva being an instrument of Prakriti, an instrument of one’s own nature, an instrument of God, and having free will – that is an extremely secret knowledge, because, unless that state is attained through [spiritual] work, the truth of it is not experienced. The understanding from spoken words remains in the realm of concept/imagination. There is no use in it. That is why the Lord is saying, “This knowledge that is deeper than the deepest secret (a teaching that is above even the level of the chitta [personal consciousness [the highest point in the antahkarana]]) – I have now told you. Reflecting on this again and again, when resolve comes into being [alternate translation: when you have reached the culmination of spiritual attainment] – whatever desire rises up in you (there will not be any arising of desire at all), do that.” This means: go above the Ajna, reflect on this matter of jiva, Ishvara and Maya, and as you get to the final border, through the power of Self-Knowledge, you will see that for as long as the current of desire runs with the matters of Prakritic worldly experience – for that long does one absolutely have to go round and round in the bondage of karma [actions and their fruits] due to ignorance. But if that current of desire, through recourse in Prakriti, is thrown into Ishvara [alternate translation: if that current of desire is thrown into Ishvara, Who is the refuge of Prakriti], all karma is destroyed through experiencing them, and no bondage remains. The Peace-filled State of Ishvara or the State of Emancipation is attained. From the fruits of reflecting [on the aforementioned matter], as soon as this knowledge is directly realized, the current of desires is offered into Ishvara [spontaneously/automatically]. At that time, “svakarmaNA tamabhyarchya siddhiṃ vindati mAnavah” [worshipping while carrying out one’s own karma [duty], the human being comes to know perfection] – other than a desire that follows this statement, no other desire happens. Who, after directly seeing [the Truth], willingly prays to be bound? That is why the Lord is saying, “After much reflection, whatever you wish – do that.”"
64,"Again hear from Me the supreme teaching that is most secret. You are absolutely dear to me. For that reason, I am telling you this for your benefit. ","No one is dear to the Lord, and no one is not dear either. He is the Ordainer of the fruits of karma [action]. However one’s karma is, He metes out the fruits according to that. And whichever way one receives Him, that is also how He receives that being. “Ye yathA mAṃ prapadyante tAṃstathaiva bhajAmAham” [in whatever way people surrender unto Me, I reciprocate accordingly]. Arjuna loves the Lord extremely. Therefore, the Lord also loves Arjuna extremely. Via the fruit of the karma [act] of loving [done by Arjuna], the Lord is giving love [to Arjuna]. According to the fruit that has come forth from [Arjuna’s] petitioning: “shiShyaste’haṃ shAdhi mAṃ tvAṃ prapannam” [teach me, who has taken refuge in You], [due to his] admitting to discipleship, and surrendering guilelessly, [the Lord] is bestowing upon [Arjuna] the teaching of Supreme Beneficence. In case Arjuna is still incapable, even after endlessly reflecting upon the exceedingly deep scripture of the [Bhagavad] Gita – that is why the Lord is gathering up the essence [of the teaching] and stating it in the next two slokas [18:65 and 18:66]. The essential meaning of this sloka [18:64] is this: the mystery of “I” – which is much deeper than even the deepest secret – which cannot be known if “mine” is cultivated and if there is contact with any other thing (that which does not come forth if there is even the slightest interaction with Prakriti – which remains secret – that is why it is “most secret”) – I am again telling you this great teaching for your benefit. This is because you have been doing devotional-practice to “I” until now and have become unmoving and still, and have become absolutely dear to “I”. (See Chapter 12, slokas 13 through 20 [of the Bhagavad Gita].)"
65,"Have mind on Me, be devoted to Me, offer to Me, bow to Me. You will indeed attain Me. You are dear to Me. (For this reason,) truly I promise [this to you].","Just previously, the Lord said, “tamabhyarchya siddhiṃ vindati mAnava” [worshipping Him, the human being attains perfection], and therefore, “tameva sharaNaṃ gacchha” [go surrender unto Him]; now He is saying “manmanA bhava” [have mind on Me] etc. By this, He is explaining that that “Him,” the One that I am calling “Ishvara” [God], the One from Whom all beings/phenomena have come forth, by Whom all of this is pervaded – that “Him” is actually this “Me.” He is “I” – “So’ham” [I am That; I am He]. This knowledge – So’ham – is most secret. There is no way this knowledge can be explained. If that State is not attained, it cannot be known/understood. It is known only by one’s own Awareness! The knowledge known by one’s own Awareness is that which is secret, because that cannot be expressed in language. Among all of the knowledge known by one’s own Awareness that there is – this is the most secret of all or: this is the most secret of them all]. This is so because this [knowledge] is the final one. After this, the “I” disappears, and there is no knowable and knowledge that remains.
 
Teaching the knowledge of So’ham in the guise of conversation, the Lord brings together the essence of attained knowledge and practice – the essence of the entire [Bhagavad] Gita – in this sloka [verse]. He is showing that after this sadhana [spiritual practice], there are four stages, one after the other – meaning: [in ascending order] “mana”/”manas” [mind], “buddhi” [intellect], “ahamkar} [ego], chitta [personal consciousness] of the antahkarana – the four types of Kriya that are performed in these sequentially ascending fields. The four types of Kriya are as follows.
 
First: “manmanA bhava” [keep mind on Me] – in “Me” – meaning: fix the mind in Kutastha Chaitanya – meaning: do the Kriya of the field of mind/manas. The Ajna-chakra is that which is the field of mind/manas, or “Tapoloka,” the junction-place of the field of knowledge and the field of ignorance. Another name for it is “Manas-chakra.” The center of it is called “Kuta” or “Kutastha.” The lower side of that Kutastha is the place of mind/manas and the field of action, whose presiding deity is “Chandrama” or the moon. And the upper side [of Kutastha] is the place of intellect/buddhi and the field of devotion, whose presiding deity is “Savita” or sun. The nadi [subtle passageway] of the sun is called “pingala.” Another name for it is “Kalindi” or the Yamuna river. That is what is there within those two sides. Kutastha Chaitanya is indeed Akshara Purush [Indestructible Person]. Brahmaa, Vishnu, Shiva, Rama, Krishna, Durga, Kali etc. are forms of Its states. It is God Himself. It is the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna. He has two eyes, one is that “Chandrama” and the other is that “Savita.” In the yoga of action in the field of action, He is Grace; and in the yoga of devotion in the field of devotion, He is Love. This is His “Lila” [mystic play].
 
In sadhana, He is the slayer of the asura [demon] “Kangsa” [demon king], who symbolizes the cause of bondage to samsara for the sadhak. That is why there is the prayer of the sadhak: “kṛShNah karotu kalyANaṃ kaṃsakunjarakesharee; kalindeejala kallola kolahala kutuhalah” [O Krishna, bless me/us, [You Who is] the lion to elephant Kangsa, [You Who] sports with joyful cheer and celebration in the waters of the Yamuna river].
 
The six chakras are indeed [those chakras] that are from the Muladhar-chakra to the Chandrama in the Ajna-chakra. Doing yogic practice/Kriya (pranayam, purification of ida and pingala, piercing the knots, etc.) in those six chakras is indeed that which is called “manmana” [mind on Me] in the [Bhagavad Gita]. (Those practices are of the karma-yoga aspect [yoga of doing spiritual practice] –  named “Tapah” [disciplines] – of Kriyayoga in the philosophy of Patanjali – meaning: “yama” [dont’s], “niyama” [do’s], “asana” [posture], “pranayam” [yogic breathing], “pratyahar” [mind withdrawal], “dharana” [concentration], “dhyan” [meditation] and “samadhi” [absorption]. In Vedic devotions, that [same discipline is called] is pranayam or the rite of “Aghomarshana.” And in “Rasalila” [Sri Krishna’s pastimes], this is the “searching for Krishna.”)
 
Second: “madbhaktah bhava” [be devoted to Me] – upon piercing Kutastha and rising up to the upper side, do the practice/Kriya of the field of buddhi. Be My (the Indestructible Being’s) devotee. Be attached only to Me – meaning: after fixing mind on Me, bring the mind under control according to the following method: “yatah yatah nischarati tatastatah niyamyaitat Atmani eva vashaṃ nayet” [this is an abbreviated statement from the original sloka 6:26 of the Bhagavad Gita; translation of the abbreviation is: whenever and wherever the mind wanders, one should bring it back continually/regularly and bring it under the control of the Self] (this is that which is the “action” part of bhakti [devotion]), and thereby, take the mind’s [tendencies of] attachment and addiction onto the path of bhakti-yoga [yoga of devotion], and while taking up devotion to Vaishnavi-Shakti, throw it solely into Me – that Chaitanya Purush [Consciousness-Person] that is in the middle of that Sun-Sphere. Do not put your mind on anything else whatsoever. The spiritual practice of meditating after taking up this Vaishnavi-Shakti is the spiritual practice of the field of intellect/buddhi. When She is pleased, perfection is attained. “SaiShA prasannA nṛNAṃ bhavati muktaye” [Her being pleased leads to being Emancipated]. (This is indeed the spiritual practice of “svadhyaya” [thorough observation of the Divine], the “knowledge” part of bhakti, the “Suryopasthan” and “Gayatri” of the Vedic devotions, and in “Rasalila,” the act of witnessing the Self, with the Devotion-Goddess and the Gopis seeing the form of “manmatha-manmatha.”)
 
Third: “madyAjee bhava” [be in such a way that you offer to Me] – as soon as devotion blossoms, the desires and longings turn around, go in the direction of God, and transform to love (love towards God). At that time, one has to rise to the field of oneself, or the field of the ego/ahamkar, and become “madyaji” [offer to Me]. One has to offer the oblation of oneself [ego] to the Self (the final spiritual act of devotion is the offering of oneself). That is the “madyaji” state. That is why the Lord is saying, “Be ‘madyaji’” – meaning: worship Me with mantra – meaning: the mantra of mine that is called “Pranava” – utter that Pranava, and with that, offer unto Me the ego, mind and energy as oblations. (This is the “vigyan” [applied knowledge] part within the bhakti [devotion] aspect in the “svadhyaya” practice of the philosophy of Patanjali, the “Atma-raksha” rite of the Vedic devotions – meaning: the act of keeping the Self on top of the self (the ego/ahamkar) – (keeping oneself with the Supreme God), and, in Rasalila, each of the Gopis servicing or worshipping Sri Krishna as He sits on the clothes that He has taken away from them.)
 
After that, the fourth: “mAṃ namaskuru” [bow to Me] – one has to do the Kriya of “namaskar” [bowing] upon rising up from the field of ego to the field of chitta [personal consciousness]. That is indeed the practice of stopping the waves in consciousness. That is why the Lord is saying, “mAṃ namaskuru.” Bow to Me, with joined hands, and with the head bow towards Me – meaning: after going through the previously mentioned three stages and having come near Me and being in the same state, look at Me with a steady eye, unite the power of action and the power of knowledge – make it non-doing/non-effortful. As soon as these two operative powers unite, right then, the state of equilibrium will come about. The senses will only become inoperative. There will be no vision. Non-vision will come. Until practice matures, this seeing and not seeing will happen repeatedly. This is that which is “namaskar.” Do this, verily. (This is the act of “Ishvara pranidhan” [surrendering to God] in the philosophy of Patanjali, the “Rudropasthan” rite of the Vedic devotions, and the aspect of “rasotsava” [ecstatic celebration] in Rasalila – the springing forth of Bliss that comes from the union with God that happens after the waves in consciousness are stopped – that.)
 
After that the fifth, or final fruit: “mAmevaiShyasi” [to Me in this way you shall go] – You will indeed attain Me. You will come into Me and merge and become “I”. You will attain the state of “So’ham.” This is an absolute truth. There is no this way or that way with this. If one has become dear, this will happen inevitably. (This is “upanishad” – meaning: “upa” = near; “ni” = in “nischaya” [certainty], without fail; “sad” – going – that by which one can go – that event.)
 
The essential simple meaning of the sloka is this:
 
The work of the mind is “vikalpa” (relinquishing) and “sankalpa” (grasping). Make your mind let go of the worldly experience and have it grab a hold of “I”. Just as a devotee – meaning: worshipper – takes on the form and qualities of the worshipped gods upon engaging mind and energy and merging with them – you too, merge mind and energy into “I” (the Kriya is learned from guru’s teachings), and become “I”. Bow to “I” Itself (the bowing happens from the same to the same) – meaning: unite yourself with the Self. I am vowing to you truly, O dear one of “I”!  You will become “I”. Your Liberation is inevitable."
66,"Abandon all dharmas, and take refuge only in Me. I will free you from all sins. Do not grieve.","“Dharma” – this is one word in the Sanskrit language that has a meaning that covers an expansive range. Gradually, from the expansive meaning, it has been brought down to meanings with more particular usages. Adding “mana” [mind [meaning: that which grasps]] to the root “dhṛ,” the combination has culminated into the word “dharma.” According to the root-word-oriented meaning: “that which is held onto for support” – that is “dharma.” This type of definition is there. — Begin Footnote. — “dhAraNAddharmamityAhuh dharmo dhArayate prajAh
yah syAddhAraNasaṃyuktah sa dharmo narapungava”
 
[the “holding on” is that which is called “dharma”; dharma is that which holds together the creation; so it is – that one who holds on to that dharma is the best of humans]
 — End Footnote. — According to this definition (1st definition), the Primal Person Himself, the Lord of creation, the Ordainer is “dharma,” because it is by “holding on to Him” that this creation exists. Thus (2nd definition): the ordinances that He has meted out for the operation of the events of this creation – meaning: the ordinances that have to be held onto in order for the operations of the creation to carry on – that is also “dharma” (the ordinances of creation). As well (3rd definition): that which that Ordainer-Being has meted out for the jiva [individual beings] (particularly for human beings) according to actions and the fruits of actions, by which the two types of fruits of actions have been divided into sin and virtue – that is also called “dharma.” And again (4th definition): because it is through the fruits of virtue that the jiva gradually gets closer to and attains Dharma Itself (the Ruler of creation), virtue is also called “dharma.” And because it is through the fruits of sin that the jiva gradually gets thrown far away from dharma, sin is called “adharma” [unrighteousness]. In this way, gradually (5th definition) life-behavior [or: practice] according to the religious scriptures also has the name “dharma” [religion or religious life]. Because of the ordinances meted out by the Ordainer is called “dharma,” according to that (6th definition), the practical behavior subscribing to societal ordinances is also called “dharma.” It is for this reason that practical scriptures such as “smriti” [all scriptures except Vedas and Upanishads] are called “dharma-shastras” [scriptures teaching righteousness]. (7th definition) – particular duties/ways of life are also called “dharma” – such as: “veera-dharma” [the dharma of heroism], “raja-dharma” [the dharma of kingship], “garhasthya-dharma” [the dharma of being a householder], “sannyas-dharma” [the dharma of the renunciate], “pativratyadharma” [the dharma of married couples] etc.

So go the meanings of the word “dharma.” “That which is held onto for support” – this original meaning is at the root. [But] the word “dharma” can also be used to refer to nature/way of being, qualities, duties etc. – with many such particular meanings. Like the definition associated with one’s/something’s nature/way of being – “jiva-dharma” [the nature/way of being of the jiva], “manushya-dharma” [the nature/way of being of the human being], “stree-dharma” [the nature/way of being of women], “purush-dharma” [the nature/way of being of men], “manodharma” [the nature/way of being of mind] etc. With the meaning of “active qualities,” [there can be] – the dharma [active qualities] of air, the dharma of water etc. The active qualities of all substances are called [the] “dharma” [of such and such substance].
 
The word “sarvadharma” [ordinary meaning: all dharmas; deeper meanings follow in the remainder of this commentary to sloka 18:66] that is there in this sloka [18:66] – the meaning of this has to be understood in a somewhat deeper way. After first discussing its meaning relating to life in the world, the spiritual meaning will be discussed later.
 
In the first chapter [of the Bhagavad Gita], Arjuna has said, “By killing these assassins, our lineage will be destroyed, and there will the incurring of the sin born of the enmity from friends. The ever-existing dharma of the lineage will be destroyed. If dharma [righteousness] is destroyed then adharma [wrongness] will grow. And by that, the ancient dharma of the races and the dharma of the lineages will be ruined.” In the second chapter, he has said, “I have become ignorant of dharma. I am your disciple. Whatever is best – teach me that itself.” The feeling that Arjuna has is: that by the killing of gurus, lineage-persons, friends [and such], their dharma – meaning: virtue – will be diminished and sin will be incurred, and the uprooting of the dharma of lineage and the dharma of race, they [the Pandavas] will incur that sin. The Lord, for Arjuna’s highest good, and to dispel his trepidation regarding the disappearance of dharma and the fear of incurring sin, is saying, “sarvadharmAn parityajya” [abandon all dharmas] – verily abandon all dharmas – meaning: [abandon] all of the injunctions that are there regarding sin and virtue, the injunctions that are there for the protection of lineages (lineage-dharma), and the injunctions that are there regarding the protection of the race (race-dharma), and all of the other dharmas that you have become too weak to obey – all of those related dharmas, all injunctions – abandon all of the kinds of meted out prohibitions, and “mAmekaṃ sharaNaṃ vraja” – take shelter only in Me – meaning: I am your Guru; the word of guru is itself “dharma” [highest way]. Follow My directions. The way that I have taught you to do work – do only according to those teachings: “worshipping Him while doing your natural duty” etc. and “go surrender unto Him” etc. – do karma [duty] in that way. The trepidation and fear that you have about however many kinds of sins – I will free you from all of those sins. I will untie all of the types of bondages that you have. Do not grieve any more. Do not any more be despondent with the fear that you will incur sin.
 
So goes the meaning [of “sarvadharma” in this sloka 18:66] relating to life in the world. Now, let us see what the spiritual meaning is according to the yogic scriptures.
 
The five elements such as earth etc. in the five chakras such as Muladhar etc. are called “sarva” [ordinary meaning: all; deeper meaning is in this first sentence and the following explanation]. Sound, touch, sight, taste and smell – these five worldly experiences make up the “dharma” of those elements. Therefore, the experienceable matters of the world are called “sarvadharma” [all dharmas [meaning: all worldly experience]; see third paragraph of the commentary to this sloka 18:66 of the Bhagavad Gita for cross-reference and pertinence of this meaning in contrast to the ordinary meaning]. Furthermore, the ego is the “all” or “sarva” [meaning: all] of the jiva [person], and ego is itself the jiva’s “jiva-ness.” The dharma of that ego is vanity/egotism. Being under the power of that vanity/egotism, the jiva becomes captured by the delusional feelings of “me and mine” etc. And losing all sensibility, thinks of oneself as being different/separate from the Supreme Self or God, and becomes locked up in the worldly experience or samsara. Thus, vanity/egotism is the jiva’s form of “sarvadharma” [everything that one holds on to for support]. “Abhiman” [vanity/egotism] – there are six types of vanity/egotism of action, six types of vanity/egotism of devotion, and six types of vanity/egotism of knowledge. Adding them up, there are eighteen types. That is what has been shown in the eighteen chapters of the [Bhagavad] Gita.
 
And what is “sarvapaap” [all sins]?  But this: all of the karmas [actions bearing fruits] that are created by being related to those “sarvadharma” [see paragraph above] – whether those are good works or evil works, by which one has to experience heaven and such or hell and such – meaning: those that contain the bondage of the experiencing of the fruits – all of those karmas or vanities are “sarvapaap.” “Paap” [sin] means impurity, the restlessness of mind, by which oneself is dirtied, which keeps the Self covered up by the worldly experience, which does not allow one to go beyond the worldly experience, which keeps one bound. The vanity-born karma [acts] keep the jiva tied up in the samsara-bondage in the forms of pleasure and pain. That is why the acts that are related to the worldly experience or born of vanity are called “sarvapaap” [the aggregate of all sins]. The Lord has said, “abandon all dharmas” – meaning: all of the systems of acts that are there that are done by karma-yoga in the five chakras, which purify the elements, appease the gods, where all kinds of material fire-ceremonies are carried out, by which only good accomplishments are gathered, by which powers are attained, by which the threefold vanity or egotism rises up – one should leave all of those worldly-experience-causing karma-yoga matters and the vanity born of egotism, “surrender only to Me” – meaning: according to My words, take up only the thread of Brahman; and through the practice of one’s natural duties such as valiance, power and such, destroy ignorance, egotism and such; and via charity and being in the lordly state, apply “Shambavi” and altogether take shelter in “I”, Kutastha Chaitanya, God. If that is done, that “sarvapaap,” which is tying you up in the bondage of the worldly experience, throwing you into the stupor of the world, and making you experience birth and death again and again – I will free you from that “sarvapaap” [all sins]. Through the fruits of done actions you have experienced a great deal of strife and have become weakened by the bondage of enjoyment/partaking. That is why, here in this period of the sadhana-war, you are thinking that perhaps again you will have to become entangled in that “sarvapaap” and have become overcome by grief. But, if you take refuge in “I” – meaning: turning around the current of desire that has been going in the direction of the worldly experience and placing it in God, Kutastha Chaitanya, in the One without a second “I” Itself – you “mayAmetaṃ taranti” [go beyond Maya]; one goes beyond the power of these Mayic mutations. Therefore, no matter how much the mass of karma is that has been accumulated, when they [the karmas] come forth in the form of prarabdha [previously bound karma] – in the passage of time – not finding that jiva under the rulership of the mutations of Maya at that time and having no place to exist, they [prarabdha karmas] automatically become destroyed. If one remains in the shelter of “I”, one is “nalineedalamambuvat” [like water not staining the lotus leaf] – cannot be touched by sin. Therefore, you have no reason to grieve. Do not grieve.
 
To make it easier for the sadhak [spiritual practitioner] to understand, this spiritual meaning is being now expressed in a practical way.
 
“SarvadharmAn” – the dharma of “sarva” is the state of fragmentation, confusion, the taking on of many-ness. Just by dispelling that “taking on of many-ness,” causes the Indivisible Expanse of “I Am I Itself” to come forth. Take refuge in this Indivisible “I”. If that happens, then that confused, fragmented state of yours – which is the “you” – will disappear. Upon becoming the Indivisible “I”, the ego-state that produces the “me-ness” – that too will disappear. Thus, the inferior karma-yoga of intense ardor, mixed together with “you” and “me,” and the traveling about in the many-ness (in the many forms of “sarva”) – the attainment of non-doing that comes about by the ending of all that, which is the accomplishment of all action (the total annihilation of suffering), Liberation – that Indivisible “I” will bestow that upon you without a doubt. There is no reason any more for your grief."
67,"Do not speak about the matters of the meanings of this Gita to those who do not practice austerities. Never speak of it to non-devotees. Also, do not speak of this to persons who do not want to listen. And, as well, do not speak of this to anyone who speaks maliciously of Me.","The one in whom there is none of: the austerities of the body stated in Chapter 17, sloka 14 [of the Bhagavad Gita]; the austerities of speech stated in sloka 15 [of the same chapter]; and the austerities of mind stated in sloka 16 [of the same chapter] – meaning: anyone who has contempt towards these – that is the one who is called “atapaska” [one who does not practice austerities]. The one who does not have faith in guru’s words or in God – that is the one who is called “abhakta” [non-devotee]. One who is uninterested in the practice of worship, the practice of service, the practice of listening [to spiritual wisdom] [and such] is called “ashrushu” [non-listener], and the one who hates “mam” – meaning: “I” – (by having attachment to anything and saying “mine” regarding such things is hating “I”) – that one is indignant towards Me.  These matters of the meaning of the Gita that I have told you – do not speak of this to these persons. It is not to be spoken [to them]."
68,"One who speaks this supreme secret scripture of the [Bhagavad] Gita to My devotees – that one, having supreme devotion to Me and being free of doubts, will attain Me, verily. ","The one who teaches this scripture of the [Bhagavad] Gita – which is spoken in the guise of a dialogue between Guru and disciple – to a devotee of “I” – meaning: to one who longs to become “I” – as that teacher is making the devotion of that [listener] devotee firm in “I” – that one [the teacher] too, through the power of that practice [of teaching] and sadhana [one’s own practice], at the time of relinquishing the final breath of the body, will fall into “I” and become “I”. There is no doubt about this."
69,There is no one who is more dear to Me amongst human beings than that being [the aforementioned teacher in 18:68]. And no one in the world besides that being will be My dearest.,"Having taken on this human body, when the jiva becomes this “I” through the strength of sadhana [spiritual practice] – there is no one else who has the possibility of being dearer to “I” than that person, whether in the past, future or present. This is because as that being has become a ruler over Maya, that being also gives the power to have rulership over Maya to another and rescues that other being."
70,The one who studies (recites as a “japa” [chant]) this dharma-containing dialogue between the two of us – by that person I shall have been worshipped by the yajna [fire-rite] of knowledge. This is certain to Me.,The fortunate one who studies (does “manan” [contemplates] and “nididhyasan” [meditates]) this Spiritual Self-Enquiry in the guise of questions and answers (the dialogue between Keshava [Sri Krishna] and Arjuna) – ignorance will burn up in the fire of that person’s knowledge – meaning: the Everlasting Blessing of Liberation that comes forth when “I” am worshipped (glorified) through the fire-sacrifice of knowledge – that will happen with absolute certainty. This is My conviction (Truth from My Heart). 
71,"After speaking about the fruits of teaching the [Bhagavad] Gita to a devotee of God in sloka 68 [of this Chapter 18], and the fruits of reciting/studying the Gita in sloka 70 [of this Chapter 18], in this sloka, the Lord is speaking about the fruits of hearing the Gita [being read/taught].","If the one who has the right to hear [the Bhagavad Gita being read/taught], has faith and a mind free of doubt, and thusly hears this dialogue – that person becomes freed of sin and becomes virtuous. And with the power of this knowledge, that one cuts apart the bondage of Maya and attains the planes of goodness (the planes of the wise). “ShṛnuyAdapi” [even if only heard] – in this statement the word “api” [even if] means this: that just by hearing, if one is with faith and is without malice, one is freed from sin and attains the way of Truth. That it will bear such fruit if one understands [the Bhagavad Gita] – that goes without saying."
72,O Partha [Arjuna]! Have you listened to this with a concentrated mind? O Dhananjaya [Arjuna]! Has your delusion born of ignorance been destroyed?,"Now, the sadhak [yogi] is asking oneself by oneself – O Partha [the sadhak]! The way that you were, believing, because of being in the stupor of Maya, that you are bound – has that sin of Maya been removed by hearing this teaching-enquiry with one-pointed mind? Have you [Dhananjaya – the vanquisher of possessions], conquered the six possessions (birth, death, pleasure, pain, hunger, thirst) of the jiva? Has your web of illusion born of ignorance been destroyed?"
73,"O Achyut [the Indestructible One; Sri Krishna]! Delusion has been destroyed. By Your Blessings I have attained wisdom. Free of doubt, I am now settled. I will follow Your teaching.  ","The grateful Arjuna (the sadhak) is saying, “O Achyut [the Indestructible One; Sri Krishna]! The samsara-delusion that is the root cause of all purposeless perception has been torn away by Your Grace. The Remembrance of my Self – which I had forgotten – I now have it. My doubts have been destroyed. Now I am Settled in the Self of all the selves in all of the beings/phenomena, the Infinite Brahman Itself (in My own Being). There is nothing remaining that can be said to be my duty. Now I will act according to Your teaching.

With God’s Grace, grateful for the realization, the sadhak became free of doubt, and again settled into the purpose of the sadhana-war. The sadhak sat up according to the instructed way."
74,"Sanjaya spoke: “In this way, I listened to this astonishing and thrilling dialogue between Mahatma Vasudeva [Sri Krishna] and Partha [Arjuna].”","Now, the essential meanings of all of the scriptures [the Bhagavad Gita’s meaning] are rising up together and springing forth to their conclusion in the inner perception. Whatever is experienced happens verily in the antahkarana [the four aspects of personal consciousness, including the unknowing [blind] part of the mind]. That is why Dhritarashtra (the mind [in the form of the blind king]) is being addressed, and this is being said: “In this way, I have heard the astonishing and thrilling dialogue of questions and answers between Vasudeva (Brahman as the Omnipresence) and Arjuna (the confused state of the jiva [individual] bound by the bondage of Maya).”"
75,"By the grace of Vyasa, I have directly heard this supremely secret yoga from the words of the Lord of Yoga, Sri Krishna Himself. ","By the grace of Vyasa – meaning: with the help of discernment (if there were no discernment [of distinct matters], I would have remained in the State of the One Brahman-Expanse; if it were so, then this dialogue would not even happen – that is what he [Sanjaya] is saying), this secret dialogue that is much deeper than any secret, this yoga – meaning: the matter of the union of oneself with the Self (no union can happen if there are not “two”) – I have now heard as a direct teaching from the Lord of Yoga, Sri Krishna’s (meaning: the One Who attracts and pulls one and bestows Liberation – that Kutastha Being’s) own mouth."
76,"O King [Dhritarashtra]! As I again and again remember this “adbhoot” (sacred) [ordinary meaning: astonishing], sin-destroying dialogue between Keshava [Sri Krishna] and Arjuna, I rejoice over and over.","O King! Remembering this “punya-filled” [holy] (“pu” = “push” [nourishing], “nak” = Nirvana Emancipation, “yam” – itself/self – meaning: that which frees one from the perishing body and makes one attain the Self of oneself – that is that which is called “punya”) astonishing/sacred dialogue, I am experiencing bliss at every moment.

There is no end to this Bliss. That Enchanting Form of/in the paravastha [post-Kriya poise], knowing the relationship of the true forms of the jiva [individual soul], Ishvara [Lord] and Maya, the waves of that Enchanting Sound – which cannot be expressed in words – whenever I remember it [all of it], my body immediately thrills in that Bliss. The one who enjoys this delight will know."
77,"O King [Dhritarashtra]! And remembering again and again that astonishing Form of the Lord (the Cosmic Form), I am greatly awed, and I am filled with joy again and again.","Remembering again and again that “adbhoot” [ordinary meaning: astonishing; in this case: beyond “bhoot” [beings/phenomena]] (that which has never been seen in the realm of “bhoot” [beings/phenomena]) Cosmic Form, I am experiencing a kind of great amazement within my inner being. This is because I am coming to the conclusion that the “One” does not become the “many.” And because of that, I am experiencing joy again and again."
{78}{stop},"Where the Lord of Yoga Sri Krishna (is present), and Partha is ready with the bow, that is where Rajalakshmi [Goddess of Blessings], victory, wealth (possessions) and uncorrupted righteousness/rightness are. This is my view (certain conviction).","Wherever Sri Krishna – the One Who is the Lord of all of the yogas, the Radiance of the Brahman-Knowledge Himself, the bestower of Liberation – is the Teacher, where the sadhak Arjuna – the one who rises up from the web of material nature with his bow (the sadhak whose spinal column never stoops; it just remains upright) – is the questioner – that is where there is Shree (the Goddess of Knowledge Sarada [Sarasvati]), victory (the power to control all powers), prosperity (opulence), justice/rightness (the final fruit of judgment/enquiry – Brahman-ness). This is my firm view, determined from Truth. This is my mind/heart’s unshakeable and certain conviction.

— Begin Secondary Commentary & Conclusion — Dear sadhak [aspirant; dedicated one; yogi; spiritual practitioner]! You are a traveler on the road of yoga on the path of devotion. Take this final statement by Sanjaya as a helpful aid on your path. If that is done, then you will never become despondent. Take up your bow and make Krishna your Charioteer. He is the Lord of Yoga [all yogas]. He will take you and engage you in the right path. Keeping the spinal column straight and steady according to the knowledge gained from the performance of the practice of guru’s teaching is that which is “taking up the bow.” What is “making Krishna the charioteer”? Krishna is the Form of Sattva Guna, or Sattva Guna Manifested. Make this Sattva Guna your director. Your eating, behaving, going about, rites and sacrifices, religious actions and actions [in general] – do them in a sattvic way. Make Sattva Guna your friend. Make your mind, heart and energy sattva-filled. If that happens you will have Krishna as your Charioteer. This Sattva [in this case, the word also means: Essence] is the One Who is the Lord of Yoga. Other than this [way], there is no way of attaining perfection. It is He who is “bhAsvatA jnAnadeepena” [Radiance of the Lamp of Knowledge]. He will destroy “your” tamas-guna born of ignorance. And only with the beneficence of Sattva will you attain “parAṃ shAnti” [Supreme Peace] and “shAshvataṃ sthAnam” [Eternal Abode]. If you, in this way, take up the bow upon making the Lord of Yoga Sattva the Charioteer – whoever becomes this [kind of being] – it is in that very being that: Shree (the Blessed Manifestations of Yoga in the body, and the Goddess of Knowledge), victory (Yoga-Perfection), wealth (opulences/spiritual manifestations/miracles), and firm rightness (the uncorrupted Settledness in Brahman; jivanmukti [Liberation while living in the body]) are all present. This is a statement of absolute certainty. There is not a speck of doubt in this. This is Upanishad [absolute Truth; scripture of absolute wisdom]. Along with this, remember: “yasya deve parA bhaktiryathA deve tathA gurau; tasyaite kathitAhyarthAh prkAshante mahAtmanah” – meaning: the one who has supreme devotion to God – and as that one is towards God, so is that one’s devotion towards guru. It is to that great soul that all of this wisdom that is stated here is fully revealed. [Alternate translation: It is by that great soul that all of this wisdom that is stated here is fully attained/realized.] — End Secondary Commentary & Conclusion —"
