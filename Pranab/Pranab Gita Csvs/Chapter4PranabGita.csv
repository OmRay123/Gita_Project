"01,02","The Lord said, “I communicated this 'avyayayoga' [yoga of the Inexhaustible] to “Vivasvan.” Vivasvan communicated it to “Manu,” and Manu communicated it to “Ikshvaku.” Through such lineage, the “rajarshis” [royal sages] learned this yoga. O Parantapa [Arjuna]! Later, due to the passage of time, this yoga was lost on this plane.”","The matters of Sankhyayoga and Karmayoga that have been elucidated in the second and third chapters [respectively] – that is being spoken of here as “imaṃ yogaṃ” [“this yoga”; see line 1 of sloka 4:1 above]. Sankhyayoga is knowledge through intuitive perception, and Karmayoga is knowledge through the performance of a method. Intuitive perception (gyana [ascertainment]) is not enough [for spiritual realization] only by itself, and performance of a method (karma [yogic practice]) too is not enough [for spiritual realization] only by itself. A combination (yoga [joining]) of these two (gyana and karma) is needed. Thus, the knowledge that comes forth from the union of intuitive perception and the performance of a method – that is “gyanayoga,” the result of the combination of the knowledge spoken about in the second and third chapters (Sankhya and Karma [respectively]). The meaning of the word “yoga” in these slokas [4:1 and 4:2 above] have to be understood as “gyana” [knowledge; knowingness] or “gyanayoga.” Because this “gyana” is explained in this fourth chapter [of the Gita], the name of this chapter is “gyanayoga.” To explain that gyanayoga is eternal – imperishable, after having shown the continuation of gyanayoga in these slokas – the reason for gyanayoga's disappearance – that cause has been explained [here]. The Luminous Sphere that can be seen through yoga-Kriya – with Light resembling the brightness of a thousand suns and the serenity of a thousand moons – that is verily “Vivasvan” [the Sun] or “Savita” [Spiritual Sun]. He is self-revealed. It is by his light that the universe is seen. When that Savita rises, if one steadies one's consciousness in the light,      “savitṛmaNDalamadhyavarteernArAyaNah” [Narayana [the Lord] – situated in the middle of the sphere of the Sun] - “Goloknath” [the Lord of the Spiritual Realm] is seen. It is He that is “Ahaṃ” [“I”] - Kutastha Chaitanya Sri Krishna. From that Vivasvan, the current of knowingness (the flow of the Light of Consciousness) flows downward and comes into the antahkarana [inner operators of jiva consciousness]. Although the antahkarana is divided in the four parts of chitta [personal consciousness; heart], ahaṃkar [ego; personal “I”], buddhi [intellect] and mana [evident mind], because mind is primary when the antahkarana is creation-faced, the antahkarana, together with all of its parts, are referred to as just “mind.” And when the antahkarana is Brahman-faced, because chitta is primary and ahead of everything else, the antahkarana is called “chitta.” The vritti [functionality] facing creation in the antahkarana is “mana” [mind] or “Manu” [archetypal progenitor]. After the current of knowingness comes into the antahkarana, along with the vritti of ascertainment emerging with it, the inner perception or “manas-netra” [mind's eye] (“pragya-chakshu” [eye of inner perception]) manifests. This inner-world-seeing “manas-netra” or “pragya-chakshu” is “Ikshvaku” [archetypal first king – mythologically of the Solar Dynasty]. After awareness or consciousness dawns within, then the awareness of the external is born via the organs of perception. These organs of perception are the “rajarshis” [royal sages] (although the organs of perception have emerged from the sattvic part of the aggregate of the five elements, their activities are all of the rajas guna; that is why they are “rajarshi” [rishis of rajas guna]). Because the revelation of “gyana” or “gyanayoga” is revealed from one to another in this [aforementioned] way, “gyana” [Knowledge] or “yoga” [union with the Supreme] is received through “parampara” [lineage]. And its fruits have no end, no diminution. Because it eventually becomes infinite by merging with the Infinite Brahman, it is Avyaya [Inexhaustible; Imperishable]. Due to the differences between pravritti [outwardness] and nivritti [inwardness], or desire and detachment [respectively], time is divided into two sections. Going towards Brahman in the path of nivritti, as the current of time becomes weaker until it is at its weakest, the gross dominance of time does not stay; a subtleness comes. Going towards samsara in the path of pravritti, time is “mahat” [great; huge], because it is through pravritti that the current of time becomes very strong. That is why samsara is also called “mahat.” It is to convey this meaning that “mahato bhayat” [“mahat” is frightening] is stated in Chapter 2, sloka 40. And more, with detachment, as the dirt from the mind goes away, the Consciousness of the Self or Knowledge/Knowingness comes forth. And with desire, because the dirt of the worldly experience falls on the mind, the spiritual Knowingness ends. In the world of people, this yoga of the Knowledge of the Self has been destroyed by the creation-facing vritti of desire – meaning: it [this yoga] has been covered up; -- Begin Footnote. -- Just as there is loss of memory because of aberrations in the brain due to illness, injury and stress, similarly, the Knowledge of the Self is lost because of aberrations in the faculty of intellect due to desires for worldly experiences and lack of self-control (or indulgence [in worldly experiences]). -- End Footnote. -- that is why it cannot be known by everyone."
3,"You are My “bhakta” [devotee] and “sakha” [friend]. For this reason, I am telling you today about this yoga, which, indeed, is a supreme secret/mystery.","Today, upon the sadhak attaining “savichar-samadhi” [absorption through investigation] by having taken up Karmayoga [spiritual practice], [the Lord] is having the sadhak hear about and experience that yoga of the Knowledge of the Self. The sadhak is observing that the fountain of the Knowledge of the Self from this Gita is springing forth because three conditions are coming together at once. Those three conditions are: “desh” [place; space], “kaal” [time] and “patra” [vessel; recipient]. (1)     “Desh” [place; space] is the place in the middle, between the two sides [of warriors] in Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra. The sadhak, taking recourse in karma [yogic practice], has been able to enter inside the sushumna. That is why the “desh” aspect is present. (2)     “Kaal” [time] is “Adya” [today; see line 1 of sloka 4:3 above for the occurrence of the word] – meaning: the first day of the war, just before the commencement of battle, when the sadhak is looking in a steady and still way at Kutastha in front, and the current of that Light of Consciousness is fully falling upon the sadhak. (3)     “Patra” [vessel; recipient] is the sadhak's attitude of being a “bhakta” [devotee] and “sakha” [friend]. The singular attachment to God is called “devotion,” and the feeling of mutuality with God is called “friendship.” Because the sadhak today is thus: “shiShyaste'haṃ sAdhi mAṃ tvAṃ prapannam” [I am Your disciple; teach me; I surrender to You] – and he/she has shun away all vanity of ego and the love for the Consciousness of the Self has awakened within the sadhak – that is why the sadhak is “bhakta” [devotee]. And as the exhalation and inhalation has become subtle, easy and straight, inward moving, and balanced in proportion – meaning: upon the coming about of the equilibrium of prana, — Begin Footnote. — When the movement and density of the breath together becomes very diminutive and very fine, and it ceases to be uneven, when the mind can slowly and effortlessly go up and down the narrow, “spider web's filament-like” sushumna nadi, when no type of tension or pain/discomfort remains in the body and mind, instead an inexpressible joy spreads within – that is verily the state of the equilibrium of prana. This state has to be understood by one's own experience through the practice of Kriya. It cannot be explained. — End Footnote. — – the sadhak is “sakha” [friend]. Because these three conditions have come together today, the sadhak is able to receive this wisdom. If this state does not happen, no one at all can know this [wisdom]. That is why it has been called a secret/mystery – meaning: it is hidden, covered from the sight of ordinary people. The one who has been able to open the lid of the mind – that is the one who has been able to know Him. That being has come to know that this [Knowledge] is Ancient, this is Supreme, because it is through this [Knowledge] that the tamah of the upper field – meaning: “Kaivalya-Sthiti” [abidance in Only-ness] – is attained."
4,"Arjuna said: “The birth of the sun was in earlier times, and Your birth was later [than the sun's birth]. How am I to understand that You taught this yoga to the sun at the beginning?”","The sadhak sees in Kriya that in the Chidakash [sky of consciousness], an extraordinary sphere of light shines forth at first. Afterwards, within that sphere, the appearance of an unimaginably beautiful and enchanting bindu [luminous spot] gradually becomes an all-entrancing Deific Form. That sphere of light is Vivasvan [Spiritual Sun] and that Deific Form is, indeed, Kutastha Brahman – Srigurudev. So – see how the appearance of Vivasvan is first and the appearance of Kutastha Chaitanya is afterwards. For this reason, the Light of Pure Consciousness (the current of Knowingness) first falls in Vivasvan, and afterwards, It moves onto Kutastha Chaitanya. The sadhak is actually realizing [this aspect] in this way, but his/her knowing this matter through hearing about it is being understood in another way. Thus, because of doubt coming about, the sadhak is investigating within: how is possible that the Light of the Self moves into Vivasvan from Kutastha?"
5,"The Lord said: “O Parantapa Arjuna! You and I have had many lives in the past. I know all of those, but you do not know.”","The entrance of consciousness into the coverings endowed with names and forms is called “birth.” Whatever coverings there are, they are all Prakriti's. Prakriti (Avyakta [Inexpressible]) – Mahat [Great], self (ahamkar [personal self]), intellect, mind, tanmatras [source faculties behind the senses], sense-organs etc. comprise the divisions of the twenty-four substances. Each of these is a particular covering. The Avyakta [the Inexpressible] is the space between Prakriti and Purush. This Avyakta is indeed the Chidakash [sky of consciousness]. This is the seed of the Prakritic blossoming – meaning: it is the root cause of the creation-preservation-destruction aspects of Prakritic things. That is why it is called “Mula Prakriti” [root Prakriti]. In this Chidakash, the reflection of the Light of Consciousness/Spirit takes place at the place of Mahat, or the bridge-point of consciousness. This reflected light is Chijjyoti [light of consciousness] or Vivasvan [Spiritual Sun]. Because it is “first,” or, because it is the appearance of Adi [Primal] Maya, it is called “Aditya” [sun]. Later, through further manifestation, Mahat-tattva – meaning: chitta [jiva consciousness] – emerges. Mahat is actually “Manu” [archetypal progenitor] or “mind.” — Begin Footnote. — The creation-facing antahkarana. — End Footnote. — Because it has come forth from Vivasvan, it is known as “Vaivasvata” [offspring of Vivasvan]. In the outer side of the chitta, where the Light of Consciousness is reflected and thereby becomes Vivasvan – the junction of Avyakta and chitta at that place is called “Kuta.” The Kuta is an internal chakra — Begin Footnote. — The function of this Kuta is quite wondrous. It is like a hot frying pan made of glass. Just like when the light of the fire goes through the glass and takes on the color of the glass, and like when unhusked rice touches that glass that the adhesive liquid in the husk comes apart and the liquid evaporates as steam – the husk is separated, and when the rice is popped, it makes popped rice – it is just like that when the Consciousness-Reality comes to the Kuta, It takes on the form according to the state at that time in the Kuta, and when the sadhak's mind comes and touches that Kuta, the bondage of karma for the mind/heart comes apart and karma disappears. The covering of the worldly experience becomes separated, and the mind ends its form and takes on the Form of the Pure Consciousness-Reality. — End Footnote. — of Mayic-current. Supreme Consciousness/Spirit, being reflected in Kuta, takes on many kinds of Forms. This Kutastha Chaitanya is verily, “Ishvara” [personal God] – the personal Deity of the sadhak. He bestows blessings to the sadhak, and appears in many forms that are pleasing to the sadhak's heart. That is why it is written in the scriptures: “sAdhakAnAṃ hitArthAya brahmano roopakalpana” [for the benefit of the sadhak, a form of [the Formless] Brahman is conceived]. Up to the place of Ishvara, the Self or Consciousness is known as “Aham” [“I”]. From Mahat-tattva or chitta emerges “ahamkar” [personal self; ego]. From the ahamkar comes “buddhi” [intellect]; from the intellect comes [evident] mind etc. - in this way, the transmuting activities of Prakriti spreads fully and throughout. The Consciousness-Reality enters all of these and makes them conscious. Although Consciousness/Spirit, within this mind-intellect-ego[-etc.] takes on different experiential aspects because of the differences of mind-intellect-ego[-etc.], the name of the aggregate [consciousness] is “jiva” [individual soul]. — Begin Footnote. — In the world of the jivas, according to the greater and lesser amounts of the consciousness-power, four categoric divisions can be made. They are: (1) “sankuchita chetana” [contracted consciousness] – stones; (2) “mukulita chetana” [budding consciousness] – plants, trees; (3) “vikasita chetana” [blossomed or developed consciousness] - “svedaja” [sweat-born], “andaja” [egg-born] and “jarayuja” [womb-born] (with the exception of humans); and (4) “poornavikasita chetana” [fully developed consciousness] - humans. In the antahkarana – mind, intellect, ego and chitta – the various ways of the consciousness-power appearing in these four fields bring about the four different categories of human beings. They are: (1) “brahmin” - one whose consciousness-power is always operating in all of the mind-intellect-ego-chitta; (2) “kshatriya” - one whose consciousness-power is operating in mind-intellect-ego – in these three fields; (3) “vaishya” - one whose consciousness-power is operating in mind-intellect – in these two fields; and (4) “shudra” - one whose consciousness-power is operating in only the mind. And again, according to the greater or lesser levels of wellness in the structures in these four fields as well as the capacity of reflection-power [of consciousness], these four classifications of human beings also are of three types: excellent, ordinary and base. — End Footnote. — This “jiva” is the one who is addressed as “tvaṃ” [you; see the last line of sloka 4:5 above for the occurrence of the word]. Because the jiva is ego-endowed, it is “asarvagya” [not all-knowing] (“svalpagya” [knowing little]). Because “Ishvara” is without ego, it is “sarvagya” [all-knowing]. In the middle area between this jiva and Ishvara (meaning: just like the kind of place on the outer side of the chitta where Vivasvan is – exactly like that kind place but on the inner side), a softly bright sphere is seen. That is the moon-sphere. (If that moon-sphere is pierced, Kuta is seen; if Kuta is pierced, Ishvara is seen. Ishvara merges into Vivasvan. After that there is Avyakta, and after that is Purush. This is the form of sadhana's progression.) See the 4th and 5th illustrations in the Introduction [of the Pranab Gita]. The aforementioned various differences in the coverings have been conceived as the “many lives” of “ahaṃ” [“I”] - meaning: Shiva-Chaitanya, and “tvaṃ” - meaning: the jiva-consciousness. The truth that the Consciousness-Reality appears in various ways in the various coverings – that is only directly realized in the State of Shiva. It is not realized in the state of jiva. This is because: for as long as the sadhak stays in the jiva-consciousness, for that long does the sadhak's “I” consciousness from the distorted worldly experience remain. Later, when the sadhak rises up to Shiva-Consciousness, then the sadhak's “I”-ness becomes completely pure. It is in the pure “I”-ness that the universe is reflected. It does not happen in the distorted “I”-ness. That is why it has been said [in the above sloka]: “ahaṃ veda tvaṃ na vettha” [it is known to Me, not to you]. Srigurudev [Sri Krishna], using two [particular] words to address the sadhak, has beautifully shown the sadhak's state of being at this time. One word is “Arjuna” and the other is “Parantapa.” “Arjuna”: “a” [without] + “rajju” [rope] + “n[a]” [not] – meaning: one who is not free of bondage. The only bondage is “samsara-karma” [samsara-acts]. That karma is of two types: “sukarma” [good acts] and “kukarma” [bad acts]. It is the Self that is “su” - meaning: beautiful, and the non-Self-substances are “ku” [bad]. It is said in the Mahabharata that Arjuna's name was “Arjuna” because he had only done “sukarma” in the world. The “tadarthya karma” [the work for “That”; meaningful work; spiritual work] is the sadhak's “sukarma.” Although this vritti [functionality] is directed towards the Self, because the karma is still a covering between the jiva and Ishvara – until that karma [spiritual act] is finished, the jiva remains as one of little knowledge and cannot become one who knows all. That sadhak who is attached to the veiling-power in the form of “sukarma” [spiritual works] is “Arjuna.” “Parantapa”: “para” - meaning: Prakriti. That from which “tapita” [feeling of pressure; heat] occurs – that one is “Parantapa.” In the sadhak's mind at the beginning [of sadhana practice], there is this kind of awareness: “I am indeed the Self; I am not Prakriti.” The feeling of duality stays strong. Thus, there is a desire to cast off Prakriti. The jiva endowed with that desire – in the form of the casting-off power – to abandon [Prakriti] is Parantapa. — Begin Footnote. — See Chapter 2, sloka 9 for the commentary on “Parantapa.”  — End Footnote. —"
6,"I am without birth. My Being is Immortal. And although I am the Lord of all beings/phenomena, through the Power of the Creative Potentiality of My Own Self, I am with all beings/phenomena through My Own Maya.","During the practice of Kriyayoga, after merging in Pure Consciousness in the equipoise of samadhi, and then coming back to mental life because of “vikarma” [karma which returns one to the world-consciousness], and thereafter opening up the eye of insight, the sadhak sees that the one “I” is verily present everywhere and always. There is no place for the “I” to come and go, and therefore, the “I” has no birth. If there is no birth, there is no death either. Thus, the “I” is “avyayatma” - meaning: the “akshaya” [Indestructible] Being. Whatever is destructible is of the twenty-four substances such as the chitta, or of the phenomena. These phenomena, such as chitta etc., are all situated in the “I” Itself. Their existence is in the “I”. Therefore, this “I” is verily their Ishvara [God] – meaning: the bestower of existence. But for the different forms of the “I” that appears – the Atma-Maya is the cause of that, and its own Nature/Prakriti is its mechanism. As the Consciousness-Reality pervades all, such as: in “Chit” [see following paragraph for definition], chitta [personal consciousness], ego, intellect, mind etc. - in whichever particular place It is and in whichever particular way It exists there – being with Maya, It takes on the form according to that place and that way. That is why It appears in many types of forms such as “manomaya,” “chittamaya,” “chinmaya” [these are different levels of consciousness] etc. All of these are born of Its own Nature/Prakriti. In Yoga Vashishtha [a spiritual treatise] it is written that, “That by which the efforts of the Effort-free Brahman are accomplished and, at the same time, by which the emerging of higher consciousness of the jiva takes place is called “Chit.” Chit is “Avyakta” [Inexpressible]. This Avyakta Chit is, verily, Maya. Maya, upon first becoming manifest from the merged state, and then taking on physicality via mutation, becomes transformed into the Prakriti endowed with the twenty-four substances. When the Light of Consciousness falls on this Prakriti, That, through Maya, reflects Itself in many forms according to the different places of appearance. Just as, in the direction of creation, the One Consciousness/Spirit becomes transformed into “many-ness” through the gradual manifestations of the coverings, similarly, in the direction of merging, with the coverings gradually being destroyed due to involution, Its “many-ness” is destroyed. At that time, the sadhak, goes on seeing the forms of the different “avatars” [incarnations of God] in the different coverings, and then merges within and attains Brahman-ness."
7,"O Bharat [Arjuna]! Whenever there is a decaying of dharma and the rising up of “adharma” [non-dharma], I then send forth the Self.","That by the support of which one can exist – that is “dharma” [something to hold]. The jiva's life exists through holding on to the functionalities of the antahkarana. Therefore, the functionalities of the antahkarana is actually the jiva's “dharma.” Antahkarana – “mana” [mind], “buddhi” [intellect], “ahamkar” [ego], “chitta” [personal consciousness; heart] – is divided into these four parts. And [associated with each of them] are four types of vrittis [functionalities] such as “chintan” [pure thought] etc. [The vrittis represent] the carrying out of “dharma.”  Each of these divisions of the antahkarana are associated with each of the yugas [epochs], and each of the vrittis represents each of the segments of dharma. In the direction of creation, chitta is first. Its active aspect or vritti is called “chintan” [pure thought]. After chitta mutates, another vritti grows. That vritti's name is “aham-vritti” [the “I”-vritti]. Then it is called ahamkar. Therefore, ahamkar has two vrittis, chintan and aham-kartritva[“I” and doership]. When ahamkar mutates, another vritti grows. That vritti's name is “nishchayakaran” [faculty of ascertainment]. Then its name is buddhi. Thus, buddhi has three vrittis or dharmas: chintan, aham-kartritva and nishchayakaran. Then when buddhi mutates it is called mana, and another separate vritti grows. That vritti's name is “sankalpa-vikalpa” [volition and non-volition]. Thus, mana has four vrittis or dharmas: chintan, aham-kartritva, nischayakaran and sankalpa-vikalpa. These four vrittis are the four segments of dharma. It is by these that every activity of the antahkarana is carried out. In the path of nivritti [spiritual withdrawal], when one stands forth in the inward direction, the decay, or weakness, or destruction of this dharma takes place, and “adharma” [non-dharma] – meaning: the “abhyutthan” [rising and settling] (“abhi” = at + “ut” = upper + “stha” = settledness) – meaning: settledness happens at the upper place, or right above. It is seen that at first there is the “manahkshetra” [field of mind] or the manomaya kosha [sheath of mind]. Here, the four vrittis such as chintan etc. or the four segments of dharma are fully active. Thus, mind is that which is called “satya” [truth] or Satya-yuga [epoch of satya] (“satya”: “sat” - that which happens + “ya” = that in which there is full existence). Upon becoming devoid of the external world-oriented experience, when mind enters the field of manahkshetra, the sadhak sees that one's Deity of “Narasingha” [God in the form of half-human, half-lion] destroys one's form of “Hiranyakashipu” [a demon-emperor] – or the evil in oneself. Afterwards, after crossing the manahkshetra, one has to come to the “buddhikshetra” [field of intellect] or the “vigyanamaya kosha” [sheath of intellect]. Then the vritti of mana decays or becomes weak. Thus, because of the vritti of mana not being there in the buddhikshetra, there is that much of support-free-ness or [that much of] the coming forth of adharma [non-dharma]. Only three vrittis or segments of dharma remain. This means that there are now three parts dharma and one part adharma. It is for this reason that buddhi is Treta [of three parts] or Treta-yuga [Treta epoch]. In this intellect oriented Treta, the sadhak sees that one's Deity in the form of “Rama” [an incarnation of God] destroys one's form of “Ravana” [a demon-king] – or one's restless nature (the wish to enjoy the desired). After that, having crossed the buddhikshetra, the “ahamkshetra” [the field of ego] or the “anandamaya kosha” [sheath of bliss] is there. Here, because there is no vritti of buddhi, there is that much [more] of support-free-ness or [that much more of] the rising of adharma, and there is only the aham-kartritva and chintan – these two vrittis or segments of dharma present – meaning: there are two parts dharma and two parts adharma. For this reason, the field of ahamkar is that which is called “Dvapara-yuga” [the Dvapara epoch; “dvapara”: of two parts]. In this bliss-filled Dvapara, the cherished Deity appears in the form of Sri Krishna and destroys the sadhak's crooked-toothed “Shishupal” [an arrogant king in the Mahabharata] which is the possessiveness in relations, or “I”-ness. Finally, after crossing the ahamkar, there is the chittakshetra [the field of chitta]. This too is the “anandamaya kosha” [sheath of bliss]. This is because the lower level of the anandamaya kosha is the “I”-ness-filled ahamkar, and the upper level without [ahamkaric] “I”-ness is chitta. In this chittakshetra, only the chintan-vritti is present. None of the other vrittis remain – meaning: here there is one part dharma and three parts adharma. That is why this is called “Kali” or “Kali-yuga” [Kali epoch]. — Begin Footnote. — As far as the ascertainment of substances in the direction of creation, this chitta or Mahat is first. It is first in the antahkarana as well. It is from here that the knowledge of furcation [or: ascertainment of apparent existence] begins (“kal” - “ganana” [ascertain]). That is why it is called “Kali.” — End Footnote. — In this state of Mahat [the great], which devoid of the [ahamkaric] “I”-ness, the Deity of Kalki appears and destroys the sadhak's ignorant nature, which is the seed that manifests samsara. That is what is known as “chitta vritti nirodha” [stopping of the chitta vritti]. Once there is this stopping of the chitta vritti, no vritti at all remains. Nothing to hold on to remains. Then all vrittis are gone. That is verily “vishuddha adharma” [pure non-dharma] — Begin Footnote. — “A” = non-existence of dharma; the state in which no dharma at all remains. — End Footnote. — or the “niralambanavastha” [support-free state]. In this state, Prakriti, as the tri-guna-endowed Maya, is in equilibrium, at home in Brahman, and becomes God. Later, after duality is gone, even Maya does not remain. Only Brahman remains. What That is – that is “avAngmanasoh gocharah” - beyond speech and mind [cannot be spoken about, or conceived by the mind]. — Begin Footnote. — The flow of time for the jiva is divided into two sections according to the differences in pravritti [outward movement] and nivritti [inward movement]. Each section of time is again divided into four parts. Each of those parts is called “yuga” [epoch]. Just as in the external world (in the path of samsara) the current of pravritti flows in this sequence: Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali, similarly, in the inner world as well (in the path of sadhana), the nivritti-current flows in this progression of Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali. In the path of sadhana, the sadhak – Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali – through this sequential progression of yugas – crosses beyond time, and rising upwards in Layayoga [the yoga of merging/dissolution], finds “antime kalau” [state beyond time] – meaning: attains the nivritti-ness [being beyond adjuncts]. The path of samsara is actually the natural movement of cyclical activities in the macrocosm (in the solar system). And, in order to free oneself from those cycles, the activity that is needed to free oneself that is done in the microcosm (within the human body) – that is the path of sadhana! If the human being so desires, he/she can change the current of time within oneself; one does not have to wait for the world's natural changes to come about. Although the current of time is similar in the path of samsara and the path of sadhana, in samsara that [aforementioned] progression distorts/mutates and grows; the prevalence of pravritti increases. In the path of sadhana, the distortions/mutations of that progression end, and an undistorted [or: unchanging] state comes into being. Therefore, in both the path of samsara and the path of sadhana, different kinds of activities are seen in the dharmas of the yugas, according to the divisions of time. It must be remembered: samsara and sadhana are not the same. Samsara – pravritti. Sadhana – nivritti. That which is pleasure in samsara is pain in sadhana. That which is pain in samsara – that is actually the cause of happiness in sadhana. This is because the pleasure that is there in the experience of worldly matters –  with that, knowledge/wisdom disappears. And the pain that comes from being cut away from the worldly experience – that itself causes human beings to endeavor in spiritual search. — End Footnote. —"
8,"For the sake of the protection of the “sadhus” [sages; or: the good], the destruction of the “dushkrit” [evil doers], and to establish dharma, I incarnate from epoch to epoch.","“Sadhu”: “sa” = the subtle breath + “a” = “aasakti” [addiction/attachment] + “dha” = “dhriti” [holding; patience] + “u” = settledness – those who become attached to the subtle breath, and thereby, with forbearance, attain settledness – meaning: those who patiently hold on to the path of nivritti – it is they who are “sadhus.” All of the vrittis [functionalities] that are necessary in order to be a sadhu – all of those [vrittis] are [also] “sadhu” [saintly]. And the vrittis that are maleficent, they are all “dushkrit” [evil-doers] (“du” + “krit” = “asat” [maleficent] vritti[s]). The sadhana-supporting vrittis such as discrimination, detachment, serenity, self-control, forbearance and such are “sadhu[s]” [saints]. And lust, greed, delusion, egotism, jealousy, disdain and such sadhana-opposing vrittis are “dushkrit” [evil-doers]. The various types of forms in which the Beloved Deity appears, as described in the commentary to the previous sloka [4:7] – when He appears again and again in those different forms, all of those vrittis of goodness become stronger; they do not get corrupted or ruined in any way by the pull of samsara. And all of those evil-doing or maleficent vrittis get destroyed; they can no longer rise up in the mind and can no longer make one be entranced by the worldly experience. When the vrittis of goodness thusly have their deliverance, and the maleficent vrittis are destroyed, there is “dharma-samshthapan” [the settledness of dharma]! “Samsthapan”: sam = to make equal [or: equilibrium] + doing “sthapa” [settle] + “an” [a suffix of grammatical declension] – to settle in the state of equilibrium is “samsthapan.” “Dharma”: the aggregate of the vrittis of the twenty-four substances, or activity – which are, by nature, endowed with agitation. When this dharma, by being gathered up in Layayoga [the yoga of merging], gets locked in the Awareness-Consciousness, it becomes still and merges in equilibrium [in Awareness-Consciousness]. That is what is known as the “samsthapan of dharma” [the settling of dharma]. This means: not allowing dharma to do any work at all and making it sit silently is that which is called “dharma-samsthapan.” Through the grace of guru, along with elevation in the progress of sadhana, upon cutting through the coverings [of illusion], when the Revelations of the Light of Satchitananda happen in Kutastha – in those times, the sadhak becomes intoxicated with Bliss. Taking to heart the sadhak's impermanence and Brahman's Eternity, the sadhak, now filled with detachment [to the world] and such, goes forward in sadhana with greater and greater intensity. The sadhak does not become afraid or withdrawn because of the difficulties of sadhana. Therefore, the sadhak does not again have to succumb to the delusion of samsara. The sadhak receives deliverance."
9,"O Arjuna! The one who knows this True Form of My Birth and Actions, that one, after leaving the body [death], does not take appearance again [does not take birth again]. That one attains Me, verily.","Those appearances, in order to carry out the actions of protecting sadhus from epoch to epoch, by the Beloved Deity in the forms of Beings Who are Consciousness-filled, knowledge-filled, mind-filled and such – incarnations which destroy evil-doers and settle dharma – all of that is done through His Own Self-Maya, or His Self-wished Births and Actions. All of that is “divya” [divine] (“div” = the inner sky + “ya” = settledness); this is because all of that [the aforementioned] is revealed [or: manifests] within, not outside. The one who, through the performance of Kriya, upon rising within through the progressive steps of sadhana, goes on knowing those [Divine] Births and Actions – it is that one who knows in the “tattvatah” (direct and true [or: firsthand]) way. One cannot know by teachings in words/talks or by reading books. If one knows those Births and Actions of the Beloved Deity, directly and firsthand, at the time of leaving the body (death), the inner eye, because of not being covered by the coverings of the worldly experience, remains connected to the Light of Pure Consciousness. Thus, there is no possibility there to take birth again. One attains the Supreme Destination (the Permanence in the Self)."
10,"Many pure ones, through “gyana” [knowledge] and “tapasya” [intense practice], having become devoid of attachments and devoid of anger, and having their hearts solely set on Me, have attained My very State.","I am Brahman. Brahman is all. This firmly grasped conviction is (pure personal) “gyana” [knowledge]. And the state that comes upon being “samaṃ kAyashirogreevaṃ” [aligning body, head and neck], turning the tongue backwards, clenching teeth upon teeth, and penetrating prana into the middle of the eyebrows – that is “tapah” [intense practice]. It is via these - “gyana” and “tapah” - that the chitta is purified. Those who have attained the purification of chitta in this way are not just one or two. Many, upon knowing the Divine Births and Actions of the “I”, and thereby becoming devoid of attachments, devoid of fear, devoid of anger, and becoming “I”-filled, have taken shelter in “I” Itself – meaning: having taken shelter in Kutastha Chaitanya Paramatman Beloved Deity, have themselves finished themselves into the Self. Dear sadhak, [the feeling] that today you are the only one who is the traveler on this Path – it is not like that. Many have traveled, and attained the Supreme Destiny! What is the need to fear?"
11,"O Partha [Arjuna]! In whichever way people contemplate Me, I bless them in exactly that way. Thus, all human beings going in all ways actually follow My path.","Yes, it is true that many have attained “My State,” but the foundation of it is belief/faith. The reason: “yAdṛshee bhAvanA yasya siddhirbhavati tAdṛshee” - meaning: as one's state is within, one's attainment will be according to that. In sadhana, the sadhak dresses him/herself up as “liberated,” “bound,” “wrapped up,” “freed,” “sakama [with desire],” “nishkama [without desire],” “one,” “many” etc. In whichever way one will see oneself, in the fruit of sadhana, the sadhak's Self will dress up the same way and receive the sadhak in the same way – meaning: the sadhak will attain that particular state. The reason for this is: human beings — Begin Footnote. — The fully endowed, “manovritti” [mind-vritti] oriented jiva is “manush” [human]. — End Footnote. — follow up on all matters according to the perception/belief in one's own self — Begin Footnote. —  As one perceives particular matters, one goes about according to those particular perceptions. One does not go about according to differing perceptions. Thus, in those particular matters, one's own perceptions make up the “vartma,” or path, of one's antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness]. — End Footnote. — – meaning: one finds the way according to one's own belief/faith. Just as when water is churned, there are a succession of waves, bubbles and foam, in the same way, God, through His Own Power of Will, has churned Himself and has dressed Himself up as this creation. Waves, bubbles and foam are nothing but water; the difference is only in name. This creation is also nothing but the Self. But the fact that a human being believes itself to be separate from the Self – delusion is the reason for that. That bit of delusion is that which is Maya. Thus, whatever the inner states of a human being – whether it is “sakama” [with desire], whether it is “nishkama” [without desire], whether it is good – however it may be – all are actually the states of the One Self. Just as one light is seen in different forms [colors] such as red, blue, white, green etc. because of going through glass [of different colors] – in the same way, the One Self, through variations of Its Own Power of Will or Maya-Shakti, through Itself becoming the twenty-four types of substances, manifests Itself in many ways. These twenty-four substances are verily the “vartma” or path of the Self – meaning: it is through these twenty-four substances that the Self has spread out Its Maya and has Itself dressed Itself up in the garb of the universe/creation. All of this is verily He. Thus, in His state of being a jiva [individual being], He, through His Own Will to be deluded, sees himself to be separate from the Self. Even though one becomes deluded by different perceptions of the various element-filled forms, one actually is taking in the “One 'I'” Itself. But because there is, instead of the perception of the One, the perception of the many, in that person's mind, that person has to remain in the “many-ness” according to his/her belief in the “many.” That person cannot merge with the Oneness. When the coverings of red, blue, etc. types of colored glass are removed – just as the different kinds of light come to an end and the true form of the one light shines forth – similarly, if one, through steadfast belief – meaning: with certainty of intellect – knows oneself as “I” and takes up Layayoga [the yoga of merging], everything automatically is dissolved. Then,“I am truly 'I'” - this Knowledge comes and “madbhAvamAgata” [attaining My State] happens."
12,"Those who have the longing for the “siddhi” [fulfillment] of many karmas [actions/rites] – they worship the demi-gods here. But in the “manush-loka” [ordinary definition: human-world; see commentary below for spiritual definition], the “siddhi” [fulfillment] of karmas [actions/rites] comes about quickly.","The attainment of attainments – meaning: “Kaivalya-Shanti” [Peace of Only-ness], or being free of the conflicts of pleasure, pain and such – is “siddhi” [attainment/fulfillment]. After crossing the worldly experiences such as sound etc. and placing prana in the sky of consciousness in the field devoid of worldly experiences – the state of stillness that comes – that is that which is called “siddhi.” For the sake of ease in sadhana, the different guru-given dharmas [practices] that are performed – such as first Kriya, second Kriya, third Kriya etc. - the different fruits that come forth from that – that is called “vibhuti” [revelations; blessings]. Practicing those different karmas [yogic practices] with dutifulness, with the intent to follow directives, and without having any desire for one's own attainments is that which is “vidhi” [precept]. If that happens, “siddhi” [attainment] is had. But if the sadhak, due to weakness of heart, is attached to the fruits of those particular karmas [yogic practices] during the time of Kriya – if the sadhak longs for Kaivalya-Shanti in his/her mind – then there is “iha” – meaning: the supplication to the gods in the Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra [see Chapter 1 of the Gita] form of the path of yoga. This means: if there is craving or desire in the mind/heart, as one goes on performing karma [yogic act] on each chakra, as each karma [yogic act] comes to culmination, the ruling gods and goddesses of each of those karmas appear in the vision of the sadhak and bestow the fruits of such desires. Because of desire being in the mind/heart, even though there is the witnessing of deities, one becomes bound in many kinds of ways, and one has to experience the fruits of those karmas. The erosion/destruction of karma does not happen. It is true that meritorious attainments are had, but one does not attain Peace. One cannot become “I”. But if karma [yogic act] is performed in the “manush-loka” [see spiritual definition in the next sentence], then “siddhi” - meaning: the “Kaivalya-Shanti” that is the attainment of attainments – that is quickly had indeed. “Mana” = “veda” - meaning: knowledge/knowingness; “u” = settledness; that, in which knowledge/knowingness is settled is “Manu” [archetypal progenitor] or “mind.” All of the vrittis [functionalities] that emerge from this “Manu” or mind – those are “manushya” or “manush.” This place where the vrittis of mind rise up is the “manush-loka.” The place of the mind is the Agya, in the middle of the eyebrows. In its pure state, the mind is filled with pure sattva [guna]. In this state – the pure sattva filled “Brahmakash” [sky of Brahman] that is in the brahmanadi within the sushumna – the mind takes that as its recourse, spreads down to the Muladhar, and manifests/appears. Later, upon mixing with the rajoguna-filled prana, it becomes active. Then, many vrittis emerge from the mind, and it goes on managing the planes such as Bhu, Bhuvah, Svah etc. The pure sattva-filled sky of Brahman that is the home of the mind is indeed the “manush-loka.” The attainments of the karmas [yogic acts] come about “kshipra” (quickly) – meaning: during the performance of Kriya, not paying attention towards or around the vicinity of any chakra, only taking up the extremely subtle space of the brahmanadi, and moving prana according to the instructions of guru – its power is so great that the cravings of the mind become extinguished and the connection to the world-consciousness is cut. And attention becomes locked in the Taraka-Brahman Nada-Bindu. Thus, at this time, because the mind goes about in the ethers in the support-free state, and because there are no obstacles remaining – that Peace or “Kaivalyasthiti” [Settledness in Only-ness] comes about quickly, this is an absolute and inalterable certainty."
13,"I have created the four “varnas” [levels of spiritual attainment; ordinary meaning: castes] according to the gunas [essential and primal qualities] and differences in karmas [general activities; vocations]. Even though I am their “karta” [Creator], know Me to be “akarta” [Non-doer] and “avyaya” [Inexhaustible]. ","Yes, it is true that siddhi or the attainment of the state of acting with no desire happens quickly in the “manush loka” [see commentary in sloka 4:12], but power is not attained. This is because there are differences in the rights, due to the differences in the “varnas” [levels of spiritual attainment]. Brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra – these are the four varnas. These have been divided according to the distribution of the karmas [types of potential actions] which are endowed with sattva, rajah [variants: raja; rajas; rajo], tamah [variants: tama; tamas; tamo] – these three gunas. The karma of sattva is to reveal/know. The karma of rajas is to make action. The karma of tamas is to make still. These three gunas do not always remain in the same state [or: in equal proportion of presence or activity] in the body. The changes of states that occur in the mind according to the differences in worldly experiences – the gunas' proportions/activities become greater or lesser due to that. In the sattva-dominated state in the body, the inner space becomes completely filled with Pure Light; whatever there is in the universe is revealed in that Light in a serene and settled way. This universe-revealing varna is the brahmin-varna. When sattva-rajah is predominant in the body, the inner space is colored with a light red color. Whatever is reflected [within] at that time – those are all full of movement and filled with energy. This energy- and movement-filled varna is the kshatriya-varna. When the state in the body is rajas-tamah predominant, the inner space is colored by a darkish-red color. At this time no reflection at all is seen [within]. What happens [within] – all of that is vague, hazy, unclear – and, on top of that, full of restlessness. This is the vaishya-varna. And in the state when tamah is predominant, the inner space is covered with deep darkness. At that time [in the spiritual perception], neither is there movement , nor revelation; nothing at all is seen; nothing is apprehended either. This is the shudra-varna. The state before sadhana is the sadhak's shudra-varna. For as many days as this state is present, for that many days there is only the blind taking care of, or serving, the body. Besides [having the right to] the experiences of the external matters, there is no right to anything at all in the inner world. Later, when one has begun to do sadhana and can offer, and get, prana from one place to another, at that time, because of the nerves and pathways of the spine becoming gradually free of denseness, a pleasant lightness begins to manifest itself. And a power begins to grow within, by which, the darkness goes on being gradually dispelled. There is a feeling that “something or other is there inside”; and the vibrations increase within and outside the body. For as many days as this state is present for the sadhak, for that many days it is the sadhak's vaishya-varna. Later, when the breath becomes subtle and a whitish-red luminous light illuminates the inner [space], at that time there is the spreading of an energy within the body and mind. By the power of that energy, the pains/difficulties of sadhana become trivial. As prana is brought up and down by will – that brings about the shining forth of the different locations of all of the chakras, and they become visible. And the various supernatural aspects or powers of each of those locations come well under the control [of the sadhak]. This state is the sadhak's kshatriya-varna. Finally, at the time of the ripening of this state, as the restlessness of rajoguna and its energetic power diminish and the redness within goes away, and the bright whiteness manifests, then the body and mind become peaceful, free of anxiety, and happy. This state is the sadhak's brahmin-varna. Having obtained the right to having the fundamental Knowledge of Pranava, if one wants to attain Brahma-bala [the power of Brahman] after completely understanding the Knowledge of Brahman, the sadhak has to become “dvija” [twice-born] by the performance of the satguru-given Kriya, go through the progression of the vaishya, kshatriya, brahmin varnas and come to the final end of the path of the sadhana. Otherwise, it [the attaining of “Brahma-bala”] does not happen through anything else at all. That is why different injunctions, according to differences in the rights of the different varnas, are stated in the scriptures. “Brahma-bala” is a supernatural power – meaning: a special power of the highest order. That is why, unless one becomes a brahmin, there is no way to attain that. However, the [attainment of the] Supreme Destination and Liberation are not based on power, but based on the state of being. Therefore, there is no exclusion due to rightfulness for anyone when it comes to these [Supreme Attainments]. Whoever makes the effort to investigate into the Self upon taking up the mantra of the Deity in a devoted way, that very person – what to say of brahmins and kshatriyas, “striyovaishyastathA shudrah” - women, vaishyas, shudras – no matter what varna or what race – one will definitely have deliverance – meaning: one will have “Kaivalya-Shanti” [the Peace of Only-ness]. The only recourse is progressing according to guru's teachings and injunctions in the “manush-loka” in the path of sadhana. Those four varnas that have come about according to the divisions of the karmas of the three gunas – those are singularly the work of the “I”, verily. This is because: as “I” and “I-ness” are two different states (an erroneous perception) – just as there is really no difference between them, similarly, Pure Consciousness and impure consciousness, although they are seen in that way [as different], are actually not different. Although Consciousness is Eternal, Pure Awareness and Non-doing, Its Own “Other-ness” - meaning: Maya – it is by that, verily, that He has become impure, and through gradual progression has dressed Himself up to manifest from the dense to the densest. And He has brought about the four varnas according to the different mixtures of the three gunas."
14,"Karmas cannot bind me. I have no desires for the fruits of karmas. One who knows Me in this way, that one is not bound by the karmas.","One who has, through Kriyayoga, made one's mind devoid of the worldly experience and has gone above the five elements and has seen one's own True Form, that one has understood quite well what it is to be free of karma and to be devoid of the desires for the fruits of karmas [actions]. Because the sadhak, having known one's own State of the Self through the performance of yoga, is eternally abiding in the Eternal Truth-Substance, no matter what kind of state he/she is in at the time of the leaving of the body [death], that time is one's “agni jyotir ahah shuklah”; the time of “uttarayan” comes forth, — Begin Footnote. — Translators' note: The Sanskrit phrase beginning with the word “agni” as well as the word “uttarayan” are extracts from sloka 24 of Chapter 8 of the Gita. These are not translated – in this particular occurrence – to Bengali in the original. Instead of the English translators giving a translation of the Sanskrit in brackets, as has been usually done, the translators have chosen to advise the reader to see the commentary in the Pranab Gita on 8:24. This decision is made for the following reason: the aforementioned sanskrit phrase, as well as the word “uttarayan” are explained in the Pranab Gita from the yogic perspective, and said explanation is not like most other translations of the Bhagavad Gita. As well, it is not possible to make a concise translation of the aforementioned extract and the word “uttarayan” if one wants to stay true to the commentary to sloka 8:24 in the Pranab Gita. Therefore, the translators have chosen to refer the reader to the commentary of that sloka – 8:24 – in the Pranab Gita. As well, in sloka 8:24, there is an internal reference to sloka 8:18 for the definition of the word “ahah” [see extract above], which again, is not treated by the Pranab Gita as it usually is in most translations. — End Footnote. — and therefore, one attains the way of no return [no reincarnation]. And one never again has to fall into being bound by the ties of karma [actions and their fruits] through the taking on of a body."
15,"The deeply aspiring ones of the past have known in this very way and have performed karma [acts]. Therefore, do the karma [act] of the past (first/original) as it was practiced before by the deeply aspiring ones.","Yes, it is true that if one knows the unbound and desire-free state of the Self, one does not have to again be bound by karma [fruits of actions], but karma [acts] cannot be abandoned just because of that. This is because there is a possibility that the person who has abandoned karma [spiritual act] will fall from the state of attainment. But the one who is a “karmi” [doer of the spiritual act], has absolutely no possibility of falling. This is why [it is said that] “karma jyAyohyakarmaNah” [action is superior to inaction]. The deeply aspiring ones of the past, those who came to know the State of the Self quite well and understood that they would never again have to be bound to karma [actions and their fruits] – even they did not abandon karma [spiritual acts]; they went on doing them according to the rules. That is why Srigurudev [Sri Krishna] is saying, “Arjuna! Do karma [spiritual act]. The way that the deeply aspiring ones of the past performed karma – you also do (the first/original) karma, in the form of pranayam, in that way."
16,"What is karma? What, again, is “akarma” [inaction; non-action]? Even “kavi[s]” [poets; deep inquirers] are confused about this. Therefore, I am telling you about the matters of that karma, by knowing which, you will be able to attain Liberation from evil.","One who expresses a new feeling in every single statement – that one is a “kavi” [poet; deep inquirer]. One who, starting with feeling-states, progressing little by little through practice, goes beyond feelings, because new supernatural events manifest with each stage and because discrimination-knowledge dawns for that person – that being is a “kavi” as well. And again, one who begins at the first stage of Kriya-practice and moves forward to reach the State of Knowledge, because his/her inner coverings are destroyed day by day, that sadhak's vision expands in new ways and that sadhak sees all of the substances and their causalities, stage by stage. Even though that sadhak “returns to appear” [in the world] during the [ordinary] waking state, because those previously seen things remain in memory, when that sadhak begins Kriya again, his/her path becomes easy to travel. This sadhak, who is endowed with the power of intelligence and knowledge of the substances, is also “kavi.” Even for these kinds of daily progressing, discriminating, intelligent and knowledgeable sadhaks on the path of Kriya, because of having to experience worldly things during the [ordinary] waking state, the chitta [personal consciousness; heart] contacts erroneousness. For this reason, the next day, during the practice of Kriya, even though one rises above via the continual remembrance of the Atma-mantra, just before samadhi, because of the contact with worldly matters, the lower vrittis [functionalities] rise up in the mind. But at that time, mind, because of being weak and becoming numb, falls to the pull of the memories of the worldly experience, and breaks off from Consciousness/Spirit. The benumbed state accompanied by weak memories that comes about just before samadhi – whether at that time the force of the karma [practice] goes towards Consciousness/Spirit, or goes towards the worldly experience – one does not know. Thus, the state of silence that comes about in samadhi – whether that is the correct “akarma” [non-action] or not – meaning: whether that state is being experienced in Consciousness/Spirit or in the worldly-consciousness – one is not able to even apprehend that. At this time, one has to remain stupefied; there is no discernment of “karma” and “akarma.” After samadhi breaks, when the mind becomes quite awake, at that time, whether that still state was “yoga-nidra” [yogic withdrawal] or samadhi, or whether it was “vishaya-nidra” [withdrawal into ignorance] or sleep – one is not able to discern that. The fact that one can be entranced by the sleep of ignorance even after doing Kriya – this is “ashubha” [non-benevolence; evil] [see “'shubha” [the apostrophe takes the place of “a” for textual flow] in the last line of the sloka above for the occurrence of the word]. That is because this is that which is the bondage of samsara. Which karma [act] can free one from this “ashubha” - that is what Srigurudev [Sri Krishna] reveals in the next slokas."
17,"In order to understand “karma,” “vikarma” has to be understood, and “akarma” also has to be understood. This is because the way of karma is “gahana” (extremely difficult to know). ","Karma is indeed the world. Karma is, verily, samsara. The way of karma is “gahana” [mysterious; difficult to know]. The One Who is “Parmeshvari” [Supreme Goddess], “Maheshvari-Shakti” [the creative power of the Lord of the Universe] — Begin Footnote. — “yA sA mAheshvaree shakti gyanaroopAti lAlasA vyoma saṃgya kalA kAShThA seyaṃ haimavatee matA” [That One Who is the Maheshvari Shakti [Goddess-Power of All] is Knowledge Itself, and is Endearment Itself. She is the Knower of the Ethereal, is the Supreme Science, and is known as “Haimavati” [Daughter of the Himalayas; Parvati; Devi].] — End Footnote. — or “Maya” - it She Who is “gahana.” That difficult-to-know, unapproachable Maya is the “gati” [destination; recourse] of karma – meaning: its abode or source. That is because it is Maya – in the form of karma – that is “Jagaddhatri” [holder of the world]. Just as Maya takes one thing and manifests in infinite ways and confuses the jiva in all of those new understandings [of those manifestations], like that, if karma is performed in the same way, it gives forth many different kinds of fruits in many different forms. To teach the sadhak the knowledge of how karma functions, Guru-Brahman Sri Bhagavan [Sri Krishna; the Lord] has divided karma according to its functions in three sections: (1) “karma,” (2) “vikarma,” and( 3) “akarma.” (1) “Karma”: “bhutabhAvodbhavakarah visargah karmasaṃjnitah,” [The following is a word by word explanation of  spiritual meaning of this Sanskrit statement.] “Bhuta” means “jiva” [living beings]; “bhAva” means “state.” Therefore, “bhutabhAva” means the state of jiva for the Consciousness/Spirit or the “bhAva” of “jiva.” And “ut” means “above” - meaning: above the five elements or at the Agya-chakra. And “bhava” [the middle “a” is short] means “being.” Thus, being established above is called “udbhava.” “Visarga” means “tyaga” [to get rid of], “nihshvasatyaga” [the relinquishing of the breath] or “pranatyaga” [the ending of prana; or: the ending of the life-force]. The “visarga” that is the cause of the “udbhava” [rising upward] of the state of jiva – meaning: the way of relinquishing the breath that causes the state of jiva to “udbhava” [rise upward], and establishes the state of jiva into the State of Shiva – it is that which is called “karma” [spiritual act]; meaning: the particular way of moving prana so that the jivatman [personal self] merges with the Paramatman [Supreme Self] – it is that which is called “karma” [yogic act]. (2) “Vikarma”: “vi” = opposing + “karma.” The karma because of which the jiva has to come to samsara – meaning: has to take on a body and come down into the worldly experience – that is called “vikarma.” These are the samskaras [active tendencies] from the previously created [or: carried out] karma. In the forms of “sanchita” [accumulated] and “prarabdha” [ripe karmas associated with having to take on the body], [“vikarma”] makes the jiva experience the fruits of these [types of karmas]. (3) “Akarma”: When karma is finished – meaning: when prana and apana merge and the vrittis are gone from memory, when the state of silence comes – that is indeed “akarma” (that which is not karma). [See Part 4 of the Introduction.] “I” and “mine,” or “Self” and “worldly experience” - the State when these two are One is “Brahman”; when these are Connected, the State is Shiva (Seeing/Knowing); and when these two are separated, the state is “jiva” (creation). — Begin Footnote. — An analogy can be given that relates to these three states. When rock-candy [sugar] is put to soak in water, for as long as the rock-candy is hard, for that long the water and the rock-candy are in a “separated” state. When the rock-candy has partially dissolved but is still in a congealed state in one area and has not yet made all of the water sweet – that is the “connected” state of the water and the rock-candy. When the water and the rock-candy becomes the same liquid, that is the “unified” state [or: the “oneness”] of the water and the rock-candy. — End Footnote. — The action by which the worldly experience manifests – that is “vikarma”; and the action by which the Self is revealed – that is “karma” [spiritual act]. To sum it up: the vrittis [functionalities] that are directed towards the worldly experience are “vikarma” and the vrittis that are directed towards the Self are “karma.” When, with the vrittis directed to the Self, the “mine” goes and merges with “I”, then – the vritti-less State of Stillness that comes about within the Consciousness of the Self – that is what is called “akarma” [non-karma] in the yogic scriptures. (See the next sloka.) "
18,"The one who sees akarma in karma, and karma in akarma – that one is “buddhiman” [intelligent]; that one is “yukta” [united]; and that one is “kritsnakarmakrit” [one who performs all actions].","At the time of sadhana, two powers work on the sadhak. One is the power of vikarma, — Begin Footnote. — This is the activity of the apana vayu [outgoing prana]. — End Footnote. — and another is the power of karma [power of the spiritual act]. Karma tries to keep the sadhak's self settled, and tries to take it beyond the “gahana” - meaning: tries to take it beyond Maya. And vikarma tries to pull the sadhak towards the worldly experience and keep it there. The body itself is the totality of the actions of vikarma. This vikarma is so strong that, right at the very moment before settledness is about to happen in the Consciousness-Self through karmayoga [yogic practice], it awakens in the mind some worldly experience of sound, touch and such, and covers up Consciousness/Spirit. At that time, because doership [for the sadhak's mind] has come to an end, and because Kriya is going on without self-effort, the benumbed mind becomes settled in that worldly experience instead of becoming settled in Consciousness/Spirit. Thus, that settledness, instead of being akarma [non-karma; non-action], becomes one of the vikarma-experience. (See sloka 16 [of this Chapter 4].) And even this kind of thing can happen: when the sadhak actually does become settled in akarma and then, being free of doership, via the natural, effort-free Kriya that happens at that time (like the rock-candy dissolving in the water [but still evident in appearance]), the sadhak gradually mixes more and more [with the Self] and goes towards becoming the One Essence by melting in Paramatman Brahman – at that time, due to the pressure of strong physical vikarma, that still state breaks, like being suddenly awakened from sleep. Thus, the sadhak has to again come to the vikarma, which is adjoined with sound, touch etc. When one practices Kriya regularly, every day and in this way, one becomes steadfast; after that, the force of vikarma gradually becomes weak, and the force of karma [yogic act] becomes strong. Then the momentary settledness in akarma gradually becomes long-lasting settledness. As one goes on to enjoy the stillness in the long-lasting settledness, when mind eventually becomes “I”-filled, then, even after coming down to vikarma, — Begin Footnote. — one no longer has to be taken over by the experiences of vikarma. This is because the taste of Bliss that comes forth upon attaining Stillness in Consciousness/Spirit, as the mind stays absorbed in that, the attention remains in that direction. Thus, the prana-karma [yoga], for which one has become fit through sadhana, goes on happening by itself even at that time. Even if the sadhak of this state of being does karma [acts], he/she goes on being in akarma [non-action]. And again, even though the sadhak remains in the Bliss of the Self with the attention in akarma, the knowingness and acumen necessary to perform karma [action] is also present. Thus, both karma and akarma go on happening at the same time for that sadhak. Therefore, for that sadhak, akarma in karma, and karma in akarma are seen. It is this kind of sadhak that is “buddhiman” [intelligent], because his/her intelligence turns away from the worldly experience and remains Still and enjoined to the Self. It [the intelligence] does not become “vikshipta” (spent). That is why that sadhak is “yukta” [united]! And more, that sadhak is “kritsna karmakrita” [performer of all actions] – meaning: is devoid of the throwing-off-power-vikarma  having performed the entire karma [yogic act].  And, in the subtlest of the subtle vritti that remains just before becoming, united, merged and becoming One – in that all of the different karmas of both the pravritti and nivritti types that exist are present. Because that sadhak knows the knowledge of all of those, that sadhak is all-knowing. (This is, verily, the state of “jivanmukta” [Liberated while still living in the body]. It is after this that there is the casting-off of the body and “videha brahmatva” [being Brahman after leaving the body].)"
19,"One whose karmas [acts] are performed without desire – because all of those karmas [actions and their fruits] of that person are burned up in the Fire of Knowledge/Knowingness, the knowledgeable ones call that being “pandit” [wise].","Hankering for the worldly experience is called “kama” [desire]. The craving or wish itself is actually the “sankalpa” [volition; determination to reach a goal]. It is from “sankalpa” that “kama” arises. The sankalpa that one makes in order to fulfill the wish to be Liberated – because it doesn't bring one into the bondage of karma [actions and their fruits], even though it is a desire, it cannot be called a desire. The five elements are the “sarva” [all] [see “sarve” [locative form] in the first line of the above sloka]. All of the prana-Kriyas that are done in the five elements by following the teachings of guru in order to purify the chitta – all of those are “sarva-samArambha” [undertakings of the “all”; see first line of the above sloka]. The one for whom the entirety of his/her undertakings – meaning: all of these prana-Kriyas – are devoid of “kama” and “sankalpa” - meaning: one who has no desire for revelations/powers or for the attainment of Liberation when doing Kriya, the one who, without any conflicts/obstructions, simply carries out the teachings of guru – for that person, akarma in karma and karma in akarma is seen. Thus, the Knowledge of the Self that is born in that sadhak in that state – by that, all of that sadhak's karma [actions and their fruits] gets burned up. Even if action is performed (in the eyes of people) because of societal reasons or because of reasons for the maintenance of the body [and such], those [actions] do not again take root – meaning: that sadhak cannot be wrapped up by the fruits arising from that karma [actions]. This is the sadhak that is “pandit” [wise] - “gyani” [spiritually wise]. [The state of such a “pandit” is described in slokas 20-21 [of this Chapter 4].]"
20,"Because that sadhak, having abandoned all attachment to the fruits of karmas, is fully satisfied in the Bliss of the Self and free of all reliance, that sadhak has nothing else to hold [no need to take recourse in anything else].","The one who is “pandit” [see commentary to the previous sloka – 4:19] – because that person's desire for the fruits of karmas have been cast off, he/she remains fully satisfied in the Bliss of the Self. That sadhak has no other thing in which to take recourse [no need to take recourse in anything else]. Thus, even if one is engaged in the karmas [actions] of “shariayatrArtha” [for the sake of the maintenance of the body] or “lokasaṃgrArtha” [societal reasons], because there is the state of “yatra yatra mano yAti tatraiva brahma lakshyate” [wherever the mind goes, it sees Brahman], that sadhak only abides in the One Self [and nothing else]. That is why, even if that sadhak goes on doing karma [actions of the types mentioned in the previous sentence], he/she experiences akarma."
21,"Being without desire, self-controlled, and having renounced all – that sadhak only performs the karmas [actions] that are being carried out in the body, and does not become bound to sin.","When there is no “kama” or “sankalpa” [see commentary to sloka 4:19] in the mind, the kinds of activities that go on happening automatically in the body at that time – that is verily “shAreeraṃ kevalaṃ karma” [only the actions in the body; see second line of the sloka above]. In “kevala karma” [spontaneous activities], there is only the spontaneous carrying on of the body. There is no goal attached to it. When the mind is free of desire and has renounced all, no vanity of doership remains. Thus, even while making efforts for the body and such, one does not have to fall to sin (restlessness) – meaning: one does not have to fall to the bondage of samsara. Dear sadhak! Recall the bit of time that is just before the merging of all things in the paravastha of the paravastha of your Kriya."
22,"When one is content with whatever comes to one, is beyond conflict, is devoid of ill-naturedness, and knows that attainment and non-attainment are the same, even if that person performs actions, he/she is not bound by them.","The “pandit” [see commentary to sloka 4:19] sees Brahman in everything there is. Because he/she has no desire or need to attain anything, whatever comes spontaneously through the carrying on of the bodily life – that person is content with just that. For that person, there is no perception of good and bad, no difference between mine and theirs, no feelings of enmity – for that person all is actually Brahman. Therefore, “siddhi” - meaning: the attainment of attainments – Kaivalya-Sthiti [abiding in Only-ness], and “asiddhi” [non-attainment] – meaning: just being – all are the same. Because of not having any awareness of duality, even if that person is caught up in actions, he/she does not actually get wrapped up."
23,"(The reason:) being without desire, being completely free of the conflicts of pleasure and pain and such, being established in the Knowledge of the Self, and doing work as a “yagya” [fire offering; see commentary below for reference to spiritual meaning] (for the sake of pleasing Vishnu) – the person of this character attains the dissolution of his/her mass of karma and its fruits. ","The statement “krtVApi na nibaddhayate” [though performing actions, is not bound by them] that has been stated in the previous sloka [4:22] – that which is the reason behind that [state] is being explained in this sloka. See the commentary in Chapter 3, sloka 9 for the meaning of “yagya.” The universe-pervading Consciousness-Being Vishnu is verily “yajneshvara” [Lord of yagyas] (Self). Endeavoring to please Him – meaning: becoming One with Him is verily the happiness of oneself. Crossing the Agya-chakra and coming up above, the settled, steady Luminous State in the Consciousness of the Self that is attained – that is verily the happiness of oneself. The karma [act] that is performed in order to attain this happiness of oneself is, indeed, yagya. When karma [spiritual act] is performed, by following the teachings of guru and as an offering, one crosses the five elements which make up the ground of the rajoguna, and desire runs out – leaves one's company. Thus, being free of conflict, the heart rests in the knowingness at the Agya. For this reason, all karma [actions and their fruits] in their totality is dissolved. No bondage at all remains."
24,"Brahman is the offering, the fire created by Brahman in the Brahman-fire and the oblation is Brahman. The destination of the one who is in samadhi is also Brahman.","Why is it that if karma [actions and their fruits] are completely dissolved if one's character is to do [acts] as if [acts] are yagya? The reason is this: as the mind enters the brahmanadi, because of the Light of Knowledge, one can see and know that “sarvaṃ brahmayaṃ jagat” [all is Brahman]. Thus, at that time, the knowledge that Brahman is everywhere comes about. For this reason, for the sadhak at that time, the offerings – meaning: all of the causalities of the body – by which the “yagya-karma” [acts of offering] are carried out – all of that is also full of Brahman. The “vaishvanara agni” [inner fire] that pervades the whole body as energy – that is also full of Brahman. That sadhak him/herself is full of Brahman. The sadhak's “havi” [consumable offerings] - meaning: the sadhak's prana and the Nectar falling from the Sahasrar and such consumable substances are full of Brahman. And the sadhak's fire offering in the form of oblations is also full of Brahman. In this way, in Brahman – meaning: by establishing mind, life force and activity in the Sky of Brahman in the brahmanadi – the sadhak attains Brahman Itself."
25,"Amongst the yogis, some perform “daiva-yagya” [yagya to the demi-gods]. And then again, some, through yagya, offer yagya as the offering in the “Brahmagni” [Fire of Brahman]. ","The yagya of offering to Brahman is the greatest of all yagyas. But according to the differences of the rights of different sadhaks, many types of yagyas are performed for the sake of [all types of sadhaks] being able to attain Wisdom. All of those yagyas are stated in slokas 25 to 29 [of this Chapter 4]. How the sadhak, having become a yogi, attains establishment in Brahman by offering the oblation of the delusion of the universe the Fire of Brahman, and what kinds of states he/she has to go through before that happens – that is what has been taught through the descriptions of all of those yagyas. Being a sadhak, one should make a good comparison of all of these [yagyas] against one's own Kriya, and come to know what one's own dutiful work should be. When the sadhak leaves the physicality of the universe and dives into the Sarasvati within [or: in the middle of] the Ganges and Yamuna (Sarasvati is prior to “swara” [prior to “Svaraloka” - field of causality]), because, at that time, the pull of the sadhak's apana is reduced, all of the lotuses up to the Sahasrar become upward-faced. At that time, even after piercing the Muladhar-knot by taking recourse in the interruption-free Brahman-mantra, because of the errors of habit, and thereby, because one is not able to fool the four powers of the four lotus-petals, one ends up interrupting the Brahman-mantra. Thus, one has to appease those four powers. From here, taking up a new seed, even after coming up to the Svadhisthan and entering the vajra [nadi], again, due to being careless and falling into contact with the six great powers, one has to appease them as well. Again, taking up a new seed, even after coming up and entering the chitra [nadi] in the Manipur, one has to appease the ten [powers]. In this way, upon [appeasing] the twelve [powers] at the Anahata, sixteen at the Vishuddha, and the two powers at the Agya, the sadhak takes a slight rest. The energetic, reflection/shadow-free forms of all of these powers are witnessed. Thus, they are “demi-gods.” Even if there is no desire at the time of appeasing them, the sadhak has to “thokkar” [peck] them and go on. This apprehending the demi-gods and leaving them – meaning: “pujan” [worshiping] and “visarjan” [casting them away] – this is indeed that which is called “daiva-yagya” [yagya to the gods]. Later, when Kutastha is seen, the sadhak's “tvaṃ” [you] and Kutastha's “tat” [That] come together. The union of these two is called “yoga.” Those who do this work – they are the ones who are “yogis.” As soon as the sadhak leaves his/her “delusion-'I'” and goes into the “Pure-'I'” of “tat,” immediately, the sadhak attains the realization of his/her True Form. This falling into Oneself by oneself, and by One's Own Whim remaining as “I” - this is that which is called “doing yagya with yagya.” This merging of the sadhak in Brahman and experiencing Brahman-ness in the State of Brahman – at this time, no attribute/adjunct of the sadhak remains. That is why it has been illustrated thusly: “upa” = through “upasarga” [dragging] [oneself], the sadhak's “I” is “upaharan” [offered] into the Fire of Brahman in the Brahman-yagya. "
26,Some offer the controlling of the senses such as hearing etc. as oblation into the fire. Some offer the worldly experience such as sound etc. in the form of the senses as oblation into the fire.,"Before giving oblations to the Self in the Fire of Brahman, the sadhak, with the aid of the Light of the Self, becomes a witness of the extremely subtle. At that time within, the sadhak directly sees the extremely subtle causes of the emergence of all of the senses, their establishing, and their transformations. At that time, if, instead of giving oblations to the Self in the Fire of Brahman – meaning: instead of extinguishing oneself in Oneself, one brings all of those causalities under one's own control, and if one stays stuck to the state of settledness – if that happens, the state of “samyama” comes about for the sadhak. At that time, the sadhak becomes the seer of everything. At that time, the sadhak sees that, within his/her Mayic-body, all of the senses such as the ears etc. no longer get the power of activity from her [Maya], and thereby, being in a state of non-activity, they fall into the fire of that samyama, are merged together and take on the form of fire. (This is the offering of the senses into the fire of samyama.) And all of the worldly experiences such as sound etc., which are perceived by the senses such as hearing etc., come to that fire of the controlled senses, fall into it and themselves get destroyed. They [the worldly experiences] cannot reactivate the senses. (This is the offering of the worldly experience into the fire of the senses.) The sadhak sees even more: that all of the parts in his/her antahkarana are still there, but none of them are active any more. All of them are in a state of non-activity. In this state, because there is not even a trace of attachment, the guna-endowed Maya loses to the sadhak. All of the activities of all of the gunas take rest [or: end]. "
27,Other yogis offer as oblations all of the activities of the senses and all of the activities of the pranas into the “gyanadeepita” [knowledge-illuminated] fire of “Atmasaṃyama” [absorption in the Self].,"I am, indeed, the “I” - this firm perception is that which is called “gyana” [Knowledge]. Some yogis become steadfastly locked in this gyana, and sitting silently with attention on Kutastha (not paying attention to doing prana-Kriya) and going on continuously meditating on the Self, become firmly established in the True Being of the Self – meaning: upon saturating the mind with spirituality, become Still. This is that which is called “gyanadeepita Atmasaṃyama” [Knowledge-illuminated absorption in the Self]. In “dhyana-yoga” [yoga of meditation], if absorption in the Self happens in this way, the activities of the senses such as seeing, hearing etc. and the activities of the pranas such as inhalation and exhalation etc. all become still, spontaneously. — Begin Footnote. — Just as human beings become overcome by either extremely good news or extremely bad news, in the same way, those who have brought the chitta under control, they become overcome by the Force of the Bliss of Brahman upon simply meditating on the Self, and attain the total state of absorption. This also happens through karma-yoga [yogic practice]. Doing 1728 “chaturthik pranayams” [pranayams with mantra] brings about the state of “dhyan” [meditation]. And the state that comes about upon doing 20,736 pranayams – that is indeed samadhi or “atmasamyama” [absorption in the Self]. In this samadhi, the Knowledge “so'hang” [or: “so'haṃ”] [I am That] comes forth. Once the samsara-believing imagined self experiences this state, no more can the rope of Maya touch that person. That is why the indication for attaining the Great Revelation of Knowledge by offering ignorance into the fire of yoga in the form of “absorption in the Self” has been given. — End Footnote. — "
28,"Other faithfully pious “yati[s]” [sages] perform the “dravya-yagya” [yagya of things], “tapoyagya” [yagya of austerities], yoga-yagya [yagya of yoga] and “svadhyayagya” [yagya of scriptural knowledge].","Those who practice the guru-instructed Kriya-method with care – they are the ones who are “yati[s]” [sages]. The yatis, for whom obstacles never come about – whether in terms of place, time or participant – against the regular carrying out of their regular, correct performance of karmas [spiritual acts] such as worship, repentance and such, and those for whom – at the specific times for specific karmas to be done according to the rules – there is no other karma [act] to be carried out – it is they who are the yatis of “saṃshita-vrata” [observers of vows]. During Kriya, these sages perform sequentially: “dravya-yagya,” “tapoyagya,” “yogayagya” and “svadhyAyagyanayagya.” [See next paragraphs for spiritual definitions of the aforementioned yagyas and their explanations.] The offering of “dravyas” [things] in a sanctified place is called “dravya-yagya.” Earth, water, fire, air, space, direction, self, time, mind – these are the nine types of “dravya.” The six places such as the Muladhar etc. are the sanctified places. At first, while being in the power of time, the drawing-up of and the offering of the vital-air to each chakra – adjoined with mantra being uttered mentally – that is done; and later, when the essence of all dravyas, the Nectar falling from the Sahasrar, is offered as oblation into the vaishvanara [fire in the navel region] – that is called “dravya-yagya.” Upon the completion of dravya-yagya, the sadhak rises above the five principal elements to Tapoloka at the Agya-chakra, and, by defeating the Mayic attraction, destroys the restlessness of the chitta. This is “tapoyagya.” Then, after the tendency of the chitta to be thrown-off is destroyed by tapoyagya, the sadhak witnesses only the True Form of one's own Self in a steady and serene state. At that time, there is only the duality of the seen and the seer. Everything else gets left behind. This is that which is called “yogayagya.” In this state, when at first Pranava [is heard], and then from It – the mother of the Vedas – Gayatri [is heard], and finally, as the Rig and such Vedas go on being recited spontaneously through bodiless voices – that is what is called “svadhyaya-yagya.” (“Svadhyaya” - “su” = “sundar” [beautiful] – meaning: one's True Form + “a” = Prakriti – meaning: “sadhak” + “adhyaya” = “alochana” [revelation].) This is because: the “tvaṃ”-sadhak, and the “tat”-God – it is in the state of the seeing of each other as the True Form in front of each other that this [“svadhyaya” - revelation] comes forth. By going on listening to the Sound of Pranava – like an unbroken flow of oil – within that “svadhyaya,” as the one becomes intoxicated and loses oneself [in Divine Bliss], the “svadhyayagya” is completed. At the end of this completion, after the samadhi state breaks, and one opens one's attention, all that is knowable in the three sections of time from the beginning to the end are all known. The Vision of Brahman in everything and everywhere is established. This is that which is “gyanayagya.”22"
29,"Some offer prana into apana and apana into prana, by which, they stop the movements of prana and apana, and become controllers of pranayam. Some others, through “niyatahara” [control of consumption], make prana itself the offering.","Apana abides in the Muladhar and prana abides in the Agya. Apana is downward functioning “vayu” [vital-air]; prana is upward functioning vayu. Apana is restless; prana is settled. These two vayus, residing at the two ends of the spine and having their drawing powers in opposite directions, are trying to pull each to the other's direction. Because neither are able to completely possess the other, their back and forth victories and defeats are going on in the form of exhalation and inhalation. The day that prana loses to the pull of apana – that is the day that the jiva leaves the body [dies]. The technique by which the upper vayu is kept in the lower region and the lower vayu is kept in the upper region – that is what is called “pranayam”*23 (knowledge learned through guru). Those who have mastered that pranayam – it is they who are “prAnayamaparayana” [controllers of pranayam]. When, via pranayam, the movements of prana and apana stop, then there is no flow of exhalation and inhalation. Thus, “ahar” [that which is consumed] – meaning: consuming vayu – becomes “niyata” - meaning: controlled or stopped. In this state, even if the sadhak remains in the womb of Prakriti in the form of Kuta, he/she is not at all touched and defiled by anything from Prakriti. Their [the sadhaks'] entirety is at that time offered from the still vayu into the still vayu. This is why it has been said, “prANAn prANeShu juhvati” [offering prana into prana]. This state cannot be spoken about. This must be understood by the enjoyer who eats from the “thoka” [strike]. — Begin Footnote. — “urdhvashaktinipAtena adhahshakternikunchanat madhyashakti prabodheda jAyate paramaṃ padam.” [dropping the upper shakti [power] downwards, drawing up the lower shakti, the middle shakti is then known and one gains the Supreme State] — End Footnote. —"
30,"These ones who are knowledgeable in yagya – all become sinless in the performance of yagya, and at the end of yagya, imbibe Nectar and attain the Infinite Brahman-ness. ","All of the types of methods of yagya [yogic act] that have been stated [here] – all of them have one final destination. The differences in them [the yagya] are only about matters of attaining revelations or the attainment of powers. If yagya [yogic act] is performed according to injunctions, the impurities in the form of “kalmasha” [dirtiness] or restlessness in the chitta are all removed. The chitta becomes absolutely pure. The impressions of the worldly experience are never again imprinted on it. Later, after yagya is completed and finishes itself in samadhi, the Nectar that of Knowledge/Knowingness that comes forth – when the heart is completely filled with that, death never happens again. Because everything becomes filled with “I”, one attains the Infinite Brahman-ness. — Begin Footnote. — The Brahman-ness that sadhaks experience through the samadhi from constantly doing Kriyayoga – that is not “sanatan” (Eternal). That breaks. Gradually, by practicing this breakable-samadhi, one [eventually] becomes a “siddha” [perfected being]. And as one then attains the state of “jivanmukta” [Liberated while living in the body],“Sanatan Brahmatva” [Eternal Brahman-ness] is attained. Similarly, the kumbhak [breathless state] that comes about from doing chaturthik pranayam [pranayam with mantra] 20,736 times in one sitting – Sanatan Brahmatva is attained by that as well. And again, at the time of death, if one attains the “shuklAgati” [way of light] (devayana [divine path]), one also attains Sanatan Brahmatva. — End Footnote. —"
31,O Kurusattama [Arjuna]! Those who do not do yagya do not even have “ihaloka” [this world/plane]; how can it be that they would have “anya loka” [other worlds/planes]?,"Those who do not search for the Self through worshipping the Beloved Deity with devotion and reverence – their inner state is full of sorrow/pain – meaning: their inner sky is covered with darkness. Thus, they cannot see the Light of the Self. The impurities in the chitta are also not removed. The reason for this is: by not being able to know the truth about samsara, they believe the impermanent and untrue to be Eternal and True, and they remain in delusion. If one takes the help of the Light of the Self and attains the Knowledge of Truth, one can have Peace even living in the samsara of pain and delusion; this does not happen for them. That is why they do not even have “ihaloka” [this world/plane]. — Begin Footnote. —  [“Ihaloka:] “i” = small power; “ha” = to cast off; “loka” = whatever there is to be seen – meaning: after casting off the small power through the upward directed progress of sadhana, the things that are seen at the beginning of being with the greater power – that is called “ihaloka.” Even child/novice sadhaks witness this. — End Footnote. — If this world/plane is not there, then how can there be the realization of other worlds/planes through sadhana? After leaving the body [dying] - the worlds/planes that are attained due to the results of good karma [actions] – all of those are “anya loka” [other worlds/planes]. All of those worlds/planes are progressively better. The world/plane that is at the very top of that gradation – that is “Goloka” - “Vaikuntha” [names for the Supreme Abode], or the Destination from which there is no return. If yagya [spiritual act] is not performed, the Self is not seen; thus, “ihaloka” [this world/plane] [for that person] is filled with disturbance. If the Self is not seen, the Supreme Destination is not attained; thus, one has to remain in the turbulence of birth and death. Therefore, dear sadhak! Perform yagya [yogic act]. You have the ability to perform yagya. That is why you are called “Kurusattama” - meaning: fully adept (endowed with success)."
32,"Like this, there are many types of yagya which are spoken about from the mouth of Brahmaa [the creator aspect of the Hindu Trinity] (in the Vedas). Know all of those to be born of action. Knowing in this way, you will be able to attain Liberation.","In the “dharaabeeja” [foundational seed] in the Muladhar resides Brahmaa [creator aspect of the Hindu Trinity], with the arms of the Vedas (“chaturbhuja” [four-armed form]). It is from his lotus-mouth that the Vedas are being recited - “mukhAnbhojalakshmeeshchachaturbhAgavedah” [from the mouth of the consort of Lakshmi comes the Veda in four parts]. Thus, the Vedas are also known as “the mouth of Brahmaa.” The triangle-shaped yoni that is within the square-shaped abode of the earth-element – the mouth of the sushumna is there exactly in the middle of that yoni; that mouth is indeed the mouth of Brahmaa. The mother of the Vedas – Gayatri – resides in that very place. It is from that place that the many types of Vedic yagya come forth. This can be seen. — Begin Footnote. — Whatever there is to be seen or heard from wherever – all happen [meaning: are known] by simply having stilled attention in the Kutastha in the middle of the eyebrows. It is for this reason that guru gives “agya” [directive] to still prana in the middle of the eyebrows. It is because of such “agya” [directive] that the name of the chakra in the middle of the eyebrows is called “Agya-chakra.” — End Footnote. — All of those emerge from the “kayic,” “vachiki” and “manasik” karmas [karmas of body, speech and mind – respectively] – meaning: amongst the repertoire of rites, all of the kinds of rites that can be performed by the body, mind and speech – when those happen, all of those many [other] kinds of yagyas emerge [as well]. In the state of non-doing which is beyond karma [actions and their fruits], where the True Form of the Self is revealed – none of these [karmas [rites]] exist there. If one knows this wisdom in the steady concentrated focus that comes about from the practice of Kriya, one attains Liberation. One never again has to fall into the bondage of samsara."
33,O Parantapa [Arjuna]! gyana-yagya is superior to dravya-yagya [see first line of commentary below]. O Partha [Arjuna]! All types of karmas [rites] end in gyana.,"See the commentary to sloka 28 [of this Chapter 4] for the meanings of “dravya-yagya” and “gyana-yagya.” From that it can be seen that all types of karmas [rites; acts] become less and less [in density] and are finally transformed to gyana [knowledge; knowingness]. gyana is indeed the completion of karma [rites; acts]. When gyana dawns, one is freed of all karma [actions and their fruits]. It is for this reason that gyana-yagya is greater than dravya-yagya. "
34,"Through submission, enquiry and service, be resolved to know that “gyana” [knowledge]. (If that is done) the spiritually seeing teachers will instruct you in gyana.","What gyana is – there are three means of knowing that: “pranipat” [submission], “pariprashna” [enquiry] and “seva” [service]. [All of] these, due to the differences in the gross and subtle levels, are of two categories. One has to do full prostration with devotedness to the spiritual preceptor gurudev; ask “what is liberation? what is ‘vidya’ [knowledge]? what is ‘avidya’ [not-knowing]” etc., and serve in the way of taking care, attending and such. If this type of devotion dawns, the guru is pleased and initiates/instructs knowledge. The means to know gyana in the gross level is this. And looking at Guru's feet at Kutastha and moving prana-vayu from one place and then properly placing prana-vayu in different places (pranayam learned from the mouth of guru), and with that, doing service in the way of reciting the Pranava mentally in “ayata utterance” [see footnote to the commentary of sloka 3:30], and mentally asking about matters that should be known – these are the subtle means. When, through this subtle practice, mind stops having contact with the worldly experience, the gurus show themselves, and through revelation of spiritual wisdom, they attract the mind of the sadhak and [then] disappear. At that time, the sadhak, either through hearing wisdom from a bodiless source, or reading wisdom written in luminous letters in the Kutastha, is able to know the matters that should be known. Or, the absorption becomes so great at that time that the matters to be known spontaneously rise up in the mind. Through these kinds of hearing, seeing and knowing, all doubts are removed; one arrives (known by oneself) at the state of Complete Knowledge. (See later in sloka 39 [of this Chapter 4].) "
35,"O Pandava [Arjuna]! The gyana [knowledge], knowing which one will never again fall to delusion like this, by which all beings/phenomena – even Brahmaa [creator aspect] and such great ones – are seen – without leaving anyone/anything out – first in yourself, and then in Me. ","After knowing gyana through those three means [see commentary to previous sloka – 4:34], one can directly see: like the jewels strung together on a thread, all beings/phenomena are present in the Self. Nothing at all is left out. For this reason, one never has to again fall into the samsara-delusion (into being fooled) of “me and mine.” Then, “bhootani” (the whole of the universe; all that there is in creation), “atma” [self] (finite consciousness; the sadhak), and “ahang” [or: ahaṃ] (Indestructible Brahman) – all of these become one in the Vision of the Self. Thus, whatever is seen at that time – the Knowingness “I Am That” is experienced in everything that is seen. "
36,"Even if you become greater in incurring sin than all sinners – even if that happens, you will [still] be able to easily cross the ocean of sins by the boat of gyana [knowledge].","The one who is a “mumukshu” [one who deeply longs for Liberation] – even good karma is sin for that person. This is because: whether it is good or bad, if there is karma there cannot be Liberation. The reason is: if karma is not eliminated, one has to be bound to the fruits of good and bad. That bondage is that which is called sin. When the True Form of gyana [Knowledge] is known, because all of the vrittis [functionalities] of the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] become inward facing, all karmas – no matter how much in quantity, or even if they are innumerable – automatically fall off – meaning: as the knower of gyana has placed the chitta above the Agya in the place beyond karma, karma can no longer touch that being."
37,"O Arjuna! As the flaming fire burns all wood to ashes, similarly, the fire of gyana [knowledge] burns all karma to ashes.","If the gyani [one who has gyana] goes up to the Sahasrar and sits there, because of being beyond karma, karma cannot at all touch that gyani. But then what kind of state that gyani is in after coming down and being part of the worldly experience again – that is being stated in this sloka. Karma is of three types. First: “prarabdha karma” - that which began the bestowing of fruits – meaning: that karma whose fruit is this body. Second: “sanchit karma” - the karma whose fruits are being gathered. They have not yet begun to come forth. They will blossom later. Third: “bhaavi karma” - the karma [act that will bring fruit] that has not yet been performed. It will happen later. As the parts of water and air in the wood evaporate with the power of fire, and only the earth part in the form of ashes remain – and even that is extremely light and fine – in just the same way, when gyana [Knowledge] dawns, the “sanchit karma” leaves the “karmi” [doer of karma; doer of actions] and merges into the Great Sky. When “bhaavi karma” gets acted out, it cannot bind the karmi, who is like the lotus being untouched by the water. And the “prarabdha karma” - this body – that stays all right, but becomes like ashes. Through the attainment of all perfections, the body comes to be under the power of the Spirit in such a way that it can never again overcome the karmi. The experiences of karma, life, death – all become subjects of the power of the wishes of the gyani."
38,"Amongst tapoyoga and such, there is absolutely nothing that is as purifying as gyana. When fitness is attained in the performance of [spiritual] yoga, in time, the sadhak attains that gyana on his/her own.","The essence/foundation is only gyana [Awareness]; Consciousness is Its Nature. Thus, It is the Revelation of the True Form of Brahman. When there are mutations in the Revelation, the universe or the twenty-four elements arise. For this reason, unlike the universe, only gyana is Pure! It is true that the chitta is purified through tapo-yagya [austere practices] and such. But if gyana-yagya is not performed, one cannot be a knower of Brahman. One cannot become a United Soul. That is why gyana is Pure. But that does not mean that gyana opposes karma [action]. Without attaining perfection in karmayoga [yogic act], one cannot have the right to have gyanayoga. Through karmayoga, when one settles in Kutastha in a still, steady state devoid of the tendency to be thrown out into the worldly experience, then such a time comes — Begin Footnote. — For as long as mind is within the five elements, for that long is time a resisting force. It covers up Awareness, or tries to do so. During this period, time is “Mahat” (see the second sloka from before [4:2]). As soon as mind goes above the five elements, then time is no more a resisting force. Then time is subtle. During this period, one does not have to do sadhana, time itself reveals gyana [Awareness]. It was from observing these two states that the terms “time's opposition” and “time's beneficence” came to be used in earlier times. — End Footnote. — (the influence of time is now in such a way) that there is no more exertion that remains; one does not have to make any effort. The mind automatically falls to the pull of gyana [Awareness]; the mind's seed of volition gets destroyed and “Purna gyana” Total Awareness dawns."
39,"The one who is reverent, devoted and has his/her senses under control – that one attains gyana. Attaining gyana, that being quickly attains Supreme Peace.","The sadhak has to know gyana by following the methods of “pranipat” [submission], “pariprashna” [enquiry] and “seva” [service] [as stated in] sloka 34 [of this Chapter 4]. As those three methods come to fruition (the realization of their perfection happening all together), and thereby one knows gyana, as one goes beyond the “annamaya kosha” [physical body] and as one goes up to the head through the Kriya of the Sahasrar, three states of consciousness – which are the results of each of those methods – come into being. They are: (1) “shraddha,” (2) “tatpara,” [and] (3) “samyatendriya” [see following paragraph for spiritual definitions and explanations]. “Shraddha”: “shrat” = “vishvas”  (“vigatashvas” [beyond breath) + “dha” = to have “dharan” [hold; concentrated focus; apprehension]. From the Kriya of the breath, taking the mind up and holding [full attention] within is called “shraddha.” — Begin Footnote. — This is that which is known as “putting mind in mind.” — End Footnote. — When one reaches this state – that is when the sadhak is “shraddhavan.” After being “shraddhavan,” the subtler than the subtlest happenings of seeing, hearing and knowing that go on taking place – one has to unite all of them and establish them in “Tat-Brahman” - meaning: in the Bindu-Naad. That is the “tatpara” state. If it is done like this, the vrittis of seeing, hearing, knowing and such – because they are drawn to the “One,” they cast off all of their different activities and become “samyata” - meaning: they merge together and become one. This is the “samyatendriya” state. When this state comes, the sadhak attains gyana – meaning: the One Whose True Form until now was known within by the sadhak through seeing, hearing, knowing and such – now, all of those seeing, hearing, knowing and such melt and become one, and fall into the sadhak him/herself, and all of the vrittis of the chitta come to an end; the “I” of the sadhak becomes gyana Itself. This is the attainment of gyana. Immediately upon this attainment of gyana, Supreme Peace – meaning: “Kaivalya” [Only-ness] or the Establishment in Brahman is attained. — Begin Footnote. — These three states of being “shraddhavan” etc. are the results of “pranipat,” [submission] “pariprashna” [enquiry] and “seva” [service]. Thus, even before the practice of “pranipat” etc. in the subtle form, the sadhak has to become “shraddhavan” [faithful; reverent], “tatpara” [devoted] and “samyatendriya” [controller of the senses] in the gross/outer ways. Otherwise, one will not have the right to practice “pranipat” and such. The gross/outer ways are: “shraddhavan” - having faith in the words of guru-vedanta; “tatpara” - with the help of that faith, performing Kriya; and “samyatendriya” - the practice of continence. — End Footnote. —"
40,"The ignorant, irreverent and doubting persons become ruined. The doubting soul has neither this world nor the afterworld, nor is there happiness.","The one who does not practice “pranipat,” “pariprashna” and “seva,” and thus does not know the matters to be known – meaning: the one who is not a Kriyavan – that person is “ignorant.” The one who does know by having practiced “pranipat” and such, but is not “shraddhavan” as according to the previous sloka – meaning: one who has not put mind into mind and is not established within – that one is “irreverent.” One who does not have steady faith in the words of guru-vedanta – meaning: because of being controlled by doubt, does not go forward to perform Kriya, and thus is inexperienced regarding the states of “shraddhavan” and such – that is the one who is the “doubting soul.” Amongst these, the first two are better because they can find some kind of way like fallen yogis. But the doubting soul not only does not have peace in either this world or the afterworld, even happiness is not there – meaning: because of the inner sky being covered with the darkness of ignorance, that person cannot even find the right way; that person just goes round and round in the painful burning of the cycles of samsara."
41,"O Dhananjaya [Arjuna]! The one who, through karmayoga [yogic practice] destroys all karmas in their totality, and through gyanayoga tears up all doubts/conflicts – the mass of karmas cannot bind that person endowed with the Knowledge of the Self.","(The Brahman-abidance that is attained through the two ways of karma [yogic act] and gyana-ness that Sri Bhagavan [Sri Krishna] has spoken about thus far – He is summing up those very things in this sloka as well as the following sloka.) If – upon taking up karmayoga of putting mind into prana and uniting prana and apana, and later, through gyanayoga of putting mind into mind, and thereby doing the sadhana of uniting the delusional “I” (that of the personal self) and the Pure “I” (that of the Supreme Self) – one destroys the states of doubt, and abides in the State of the Self – even if one comes into contact with the worldly experience because of having to carry out prarabdha karma, one does not have to be bound by the ties of karma. Like the leaves of the arum lilies or the leaves of the lotus, even if water is poured on them, the water leaves no marks on them. "
{42}{stop},"Therefore, O Bharata [Arjuna]! Cut asunder this non-discerning doubt – which proceeds from the ignorance that destroys oneself, and which resides in your heart – with the scimitar of your own Knowing, and get up and take up yoga.","Dear sadhak! “Kathaṃ bheeShmahaṃ saṃkhye” [how will I battle Bhishma [ego]] and such types of doubts that you have in regards to the matters of the Self – because you did not perform the karma [yogic act] according to what was prescribed for your mind – that is why, all this time you were not able to know what gyana is, and thereby, you were enjoined with ignorance, and thus the doubts regarding your True Form and your capabilities had come about. But now you quite understand everything. Why wait any more? Abandon doubts. Abandoning these doubts is in your own hands. If one, upon understanding by oneself, does not abandon by oneself the doubts that one has, no one else can do that [for him/her]. This is where the great achievement is. This is where the great accomplishment is. Guru simply shows the place and not more. One must go through that place by one's own power. Take this up! Now get up and sit on top of the place of yoga. Sit, and perform yoga according to the proper injunctions."
