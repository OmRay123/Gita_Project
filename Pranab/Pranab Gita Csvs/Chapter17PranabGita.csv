1,Arjuna said: “O Krishna! Those who abandon scriptural injunctions but still perform rites with faith/reverence – what is the quality of their adherence?”,"The sadhak [aspirant] is now questioning within him/herself. When vayu [vital-force] is moved through the path of Brahman, innumerable gods and goddesses such as Shashthi, Makal (Mahakaal), from Khnetu to Brahmaa, Vishnu, Maheshvara, and even Mahashakti with Her sattva, rajas and tamas gunas can be seen. So many proofs [direct hearing] of the author-less scriptures (“shruti” [that which is heard; “shruti[s]” also means: Vedas and Upanishads]), doing things that were far from even being imagined that I could do in this lifetime – these kinds of things are remembered (smriti [that which is remembered; “smriti[s]” also means: all other scriptures besides the Vedas and Upanishads]). The things that were seen by very old people, the things that they heard; but I have not seen or heard these things; these ancient (“purana” [ancient; “purana[s]” also means: mythological scriptures]) stories, and so many hymns – I see [and hear] them directly. But not one of these is outside [the body]. When I see, hear, feel, understand all of these, and then when the mind goes to those things, it is as if there is a feeling of absorption. That [kind of] performance [of practice] with faith/reverence – in this case – stops (makes one abandon) the scriptural injunctions ([stops] the guru-revealed teaching of moving vayu). The reason is: as one is not able to stay exactly in the middle of the brahmanadi, the error of contacting these things comes about (Chapter 5, sloka 10 of the Pranab Gita). This engagement in the performance of rites (the worship of gods and goddesses and being absorbed in element-matters) – is this adherence (faith/reverence) sattva, rajas or tamas [the three essential qualities or gunas]? O Krishna! Tell me this very thing."
2,"Faith/reverence is according to the [particular] natures of the embodied ones. They are sattvic, rajasic and tamasic – these three types.","[The sadhak] is determining the answer through his/her own knowingness. The good and bad impressions that arise, which have been carried over from other births – that is called “their natures.” In those natures, there are three gunas [essential qualities] – sattva, rajas, and tamas [these have various spellings according to grammatical context]. The quality with which one is born – his/her faith manifests according to that guna. How the three types of faith regarding those three gunas are – now hear of that very subject."
3,"O Bharat [Arjuna]! Everyone’s faith is his/her essence. The person is filled with faith. The way one’s faith is, so is that person.","O Bharat [Arjuna; the sadhak]! The state in which the person is not able to move vayu through the guru-instructed path – in that state – the amazing discerning awareness that arises when staying in “shastra” (the moving of vayu; see commentaries in Chapter 16 of the Pranab Gita regarding “shastra”) – that also is not in that person. At that time [in that condition], because of being under the power of the gunas, there is only “shraddha” [faith/reverence] (working power). With the predominance of sattva guna there is sattvic faith; with the predominance of rajoguna there is rajasic faith. And with the predominance of tamoguna, tamasic faith manifests. The reason is: whichever of the gunas the person takes up at whichever time in the inner mind – at that time, the person’s faith is according to that particular guna [or: those particular gunas]. "
4,"The sattvic persons worship the gods and such. The rajasic persons worship celestial spirits and powerful supernatural beings, and the other tamasic persons worship lower spirits of the dead and ghosts.","When faith arises for the sattvic, it is for Purush and for gods and goddesses. When faith arises for the rajasic, it is for celestial spirits and powerful supernatural beings. And the tamasic, when their faith is in operation, worship ghosts and the lower spirits of the dead."
"05,06","With hypocrisy, and egotism, with desirousness, addiction and expectations – all of those non-discriminating persons torture all of the functional things in the body and even “I” Who am in the body (as the Inner Being), and do intense austerities (those that cause harm to oneself and to living beings) that are not scripturally permitted. Know those beings to be of demonic resolves (doers of extremely cruel actions).","“Dambha” = hypocrisy; “ahamkar” [egotism] = thinking that I am great; “kamaraga” [affinity for lusts] = attachment for getting; “bala” = power – all of those non-discriminating persons who take up these things, and, instead of doing pranayam, do horrifying and bizarre austerities that are not ordained by the scriptures, who, by making the body emaciated, make it weak and incapable, who do not obey My directives – “I” Who am the Inner Self – they even make Me weak – they indeed are the ones with asuric [demonic] natures. The meaning of “they even make Me weak” is this: all of those people are hypocritical and egotistical, and because of having succumbed to lusts, they do whatever is necessary [including forbidden rites] in order to fulfill those lusts. They completely disregard the teachings of the scriptures. Filled with egotism, they think that whatever they are doing and understanding – those are the right things, and no one else really understands anything. Enslaved by this kind of desirousness, their minds become poisoned, and thus, their inner beings are dirtied by thoughts of the worldly experience. Thus, their power of reflecting on anything is ruined; their power of understanding becomes gross [not penetrating]; their power of apprehending goes away, and all of their organs of perception become incapable of perceiving/apprehending anything that is subtle. Because of the antahkarana [inner personal consciousness] having become dirtied like this, the Light of the Self does not illuminate it any more. Gradually, it diminishes. — Start Footnote — In reality, the Self does not diminish. It is Non-diminishing, Imperishable. Just as: when there is light burning in a glass-covered lamp, the light is seen clearly if the glass is clean; but if there is soot in the glass cover, the light is seen outside as weak; if there is a great deal of soot, then the light cannot be seen at all; it can even be thought that the flame in the lamp is out, or without light. But in reality, the flame has not gone out, nor is it without light. It continues to burn with the same intensity in the lamp. The greater or lesser amount of that light’s flame that is perceived outside is only due to the greater or lesser transparency or non-transparency of the glass cover. It is the same in regards to the Self. The purity or impurity of the antahkarana [the whole of mind] or the chitta [personal consciousness] determines whether the Light of the Self is [experienced as] brilliant or weak. — End Footnote. —"
7,"Everyone also prefers three types of diet. Similarly, yajna [fire-rite], austerities/disciplines and charity (are of three types). Now hear about the differences in all of those.","The three types of persons of these three types of essences that have been spoken about – according to their essences, their diet, yajna [fire-rite; spiritual practice], austerities/disciplines, and charities are of three types of preferences (that are liked by them). I am breaking that [the subject] down and telling you about that. Listen."
8,"The diet that: aids in the expansion of lifespan, sattvic-strength, freedom from illness, happiness and satisfaction; [and] is succulent, gentle [for digestion], steadying and good for the mind/heart are preferred by the sattvic ones.","“Ayu” [lifespan] = the time that exists between birth and death. “Sattvabala” [sattvic-strength] = that which promotes purity, uprightness, righteousness, compassion, devotion, magnanimity, cleanliness etc. – this kind of power/energy. “Arogya” [non-illness] = health. “Sukha” [happiness] = that, when had, there is no desire remaining to get anything else. “Preeti” = satisfaction. [The diet] that nurtures these [is sattvic]. “Rasya” [ordinary meaning: succulent] = the word “rasa” refers [in this case] to the reproductive essence. Those [foods] that increase the reproductive essence – that is “rasya” – such as: milk and such – “sadya veerya karo dugdham” [milk promotes instant potency]. “Snigdha” [gentle; smooth – in this case: for digestion] = that which does not cause any agitation in the body and keeps the body feeling tranquil, and helps the growth of marrow [or: helps to fortify the brain] – such as: ghee [clarified butter], new skin of boiled milk, husked rice, barley, sesame etc. “Sthira” [steadying] = medicinal – foods that work like medicines – like: mother’s milk, parval [a very small squash], the leaves of parval, sugar-cane etc. “Hridya” [good for the mind/heart] = that which increases the operative power [the power to be certain] of the intellect – such as: brahmi leaves, helencha [a type of swamp weed], pennywort etc. And sweet fruits, sugar from sugar-cane, rice with milk and sugar, rice with ghee etc. help sattva guna to grow. The people with high qualities like these foods."
9,"A diet that is [with foods that are] extremely bitter, sour, salty, hot, harsh, very dry, and burning to the system is favored by the rajasic ones. (However,) these bring about pain, grief and illness.","“Katu” = bitter – lemons/limes, “chirata” [a bitter leaf] etc. “Amla” = sour – tamarind, sour apple, unripe mango and such, salt. “Atyushna” = very hot [in temperature] – burning hot rice, [hot] milk, [hot] tea – the things by which the tongue and lips are singed – these types of foods. “Teekshna” = spicy hot – chillies, [hot] peppers/peppercorns and such. “Ruksha” [very dry] – puffed rice, popped rice, fried raw rice, foxtail millet, “kodo” millet etc. – foods that are without succulence. “Vidahi” = foods that create an incendiary feeling inside – asafoetida, mustard, rai-mustard etc. These are the favored foods of the people who are rajoguna predominant. These bring about pain, grief and illness."
10,"[Foods] that are “yatayama” (food cooked the day before), tasteless, old/rotten, even previously chewed and foul (inedible) – these types of foods are indeed favored by the tamasic ones.","“Yatayama” = cooked food older than one day. “Gataras” [dried-up] = hard rice, dried up/stale bread and such. “Pooti” = rotten, malodorous food – pickles and such. “Paryushita” = food cooked in the previous day (old food). “Ucchhishta” [previously chewed] = already eaten (food eaten partially by others). “Amedhya” [foul] = impure, bad food. These are favored by those who are tamoguna predominant. Know that whichever guna is predominant in the body, so is the preference of diet."
11,"[The yajna [rite] performed] by the persons who, having no desire for results and perceiving: “the performance of the rite is itself the goal,” make mind one-pointed in this way and perform yajna according to scriptural injunctions – that is verily “sattvic yajna.”","When, upon driving prana in the brahmanadi, everything (whatever there is by whatever name) ends – that is when there is no hankering for results. This is Brahman-yajna – meaning: offering the oblations of Maya’s causalities in the fire of Brahman. Guru’s teaching is necessary. That teaching must agree with the scriptures. “That” – as well – has to be experienced within one’s own body. The coming together of these three (happening in the same place and time) is called “scripturally directed.” Bringing the mind to oneness – meaning: the effort that is made for the Supreme Goal by merging mind [in the Self] – that is that which is called “sattvic yajna.”"
12,O greatest of the Bharatas [Arjuna]! But the yajna [rite] that is performed with the intention to produce results and to propagate one’s own greatness – know that yajna to be rajasic.,"O greatest of the lineage of the Bharatas [Arjuna; the sadhak]! The yajna [rite] that is performed with the attention on results, and with ostentatiousness – that is called “rajasic yajna.” It is like: all of the brahmins are waiting for me at an invitation/feast (I am senior). The day is coming to an end [sunset, a time of devotions, has arrived]. But while showing people that I really do a lot of worshipping, I shut the door to the worship room and sit inside the room cleaning the nails of my feet – doing this kind of thing."
13,"The yajna that is devoid of directives stated in the scriptures, done without offering food to brahmins, without mantras, without giving honorarium and without faith/reverence is called “tamasic yajna.” ","The yajna with which there are no arrangements made for a satisfying feast, where no oblations with mantras are made etc., where there is no arrangement made for any honorarium, where only fireworks are shot off and a big noise is made by gathering people – these kinds of works are called “tamasic yajna.”"
14,"The worship of the gods, the twice-born, guru and the wise, [and] cleanliness, simplicity, continence and non-aggression – these are called “bodily austerities.”","When there is the slipping off of the path of Brahman, and thus there is the absorbed and merged worship of gods, the form of guru, and the forms of sages – that is when there is the worship of gods, guru and the wise. And when I am intoxicated by My Own Form and merged with It, that is when there is the worship of the twice-born. At that time, there is no vanity/awareness of the physical body. But because one is engrossed in the Form of the Self, this [state] is called “dvija” [twice-born]. The one for whom two births happen in one lifetime – that is the one who is “dvija.” It is like the caterpillar and the butterfly from the caterpillar. In this state, the mind sits there with just one object. That settledness is called “shaucha” [cleanliness/purity]. Simplicity is transparency manifested; that is “arjava” [virtue]. Because the reproductive seed is calm, it is called “brahmacharya” [continence]. The mind does not have aggression towards others – that is “ahimsa” [non-aggression]. Because all aspects of the sadhak’s bodily operations are functioning excellently in this state, this state is called “sharirik tapa” [bodily austerities]."
15,"Speech that does not cause tension, and [speech] that is true, agreeable and beneficial, and the practice of the recitation of the Vedas – these are called “austerities of speech.”","When true words – words that are kind and beneficial for people – and speech that causes no tension for anyone – when this type of speech comes forth from the mouth automatically – that is when there is the state of “disciplined speech.” When the idea “I am the body” disappears and I merge, pervade and abide in the Self of all selves and phenomena (the all-pervading Consciousness/Spirit), that is when the word “svadhyaya” [self-study] finds its true meaning [Knowledge of the Self]. “Sva” = the sound means “svarga” [heaven], plane, or another name for “Ishvara” [God], and the word “adhyaya” means the expansion of the attainment (the paravastha of Kriya). When, at the time of Kriya, speech about these does come out, not much has to be said. Just a little does the work. And if one stays in the pervading state, there is no chance of speaking. Therefore, one becomes “disciplined with speech.” That is why this kind of state is called “austerity of speech.”"
16,"Happiness of mind, gentleness (non-cruelness), silence, abiding in the Self, and purity of inner states – these are called “austerities of mind.”","“Manahprasad” – the tension-free and happy state of mind. “Saumyatva” – the settled state of all four aspects of the antahkarana [mind as a whole]. The state in which the function of speech remains unmoving (but not like the conditions of death, fainting or unconsciousness) – that is verily “mauna” [non-speaking]. Being settled in the Self (staying in the Self as Oneself) is “atmavinigraha” [abiding in the Self]. The state that is there in the antahkarana when the mutations of Maya have been cut away – that is verily the state of “bhavasamshuddhi” [purity in the inner states]. All of these are called “austerities of mind.”  "
17,"That threefold austerity, practiced by human beings without the desire for results, with one-pointed mind and with the highest faith is called “sattvic austerity.”","Those three types of austerities that have been spoken about – of the body, of speech, of the mind – in that, the expectation-free effort for being established in samadhi is that which is called “sattvic austerity.” "
18,"The austerity that is performed with hypocrisy for the sake of honor, respect and reverence – that impermanent and momentary austerity is called “rajasic austerity” in this plane. ","People will call me a very holy saint and honor (praise) me. When they see me they will stand up, and [they will] show respect to me by doing prostrations and such, and [they] will worship me with offerings of money and such – austerity that is performed with these audacious intentions – like gathering up a worshipping ceremony just to show people, celebrating that one is fasting, gathering together many people to show that I am doing “Shivaratri” [a religious worshipping], but I am secretly drinking water [instead of fasting] in the back room – this kind of false austerity that is done just for a few days to buy fame, but which is without any benefit for the afterworld and with the nature of uncertainty – that austerity is called “rajasic austerity.”"
19,"The austerity that is practiced with no discrimination, wrong intentions and torturously, or the austerity that is done with the aim to destroy another/others – that is said to be “tamasic [austerity].”","Like a stupid person without rationale and intelligence, saying “until I destroy so and so, I will not even drink water,” and emaciating and torturing the body, or engaging in wrongful spells (for killing, causing madness etc.) – [this type of austerity] is called “tamasic austerity.”"
20,"“One should give charity” – thinking like this, the charity that is given in holy places, at sacred places, for the benefit of worthy recipients who have not necessarily done any previous favor – that charity has been known as “sattvic charity.”","The worthy recipient (Brahman, [sacred] place (the State of Vishnu of the yogic scriptures), time (the paravastha of Kriya) – the desire to offer (charity) that which is Mayic, untrue and non-substantial into this place, time and worthy recipient (there is no possibility of activity in Brahman, therefore there is no benefiting anyone with recompense involved) – this is that which is called “sattvic charity.”"
21,[There is no Bengali translation provided for this sloka [verse] 17:21.],"Having some abilities gained by beginner’s practice during Kriya, falling off of the path of Brahman and having the kind of samadhi [absorption] in a state that is a combination of the reflection of ancient sages and ancestors – the kind of surrender that happens with that – that is the giving of suffering. This is because: the effort was made to merge in Brahman, but surrender happened in the plane of gods, sages and ancestors. The fruit that came about is the enjoyment of heaven and such, and then a re-entrance into samsara – once again, this conflict of laughter and tears. Thus, know that this kind of giving is known as “rajasic charity.”"
22,"The giving that is done in the wrong place, at the wrong time and to unworthy recipients, the giving that is devoid of caring, that is filled with contempt – that giving is spoken about as “tamasic charity.”","In the world (in the wrong place), when I am engrossed in the worldly experience outside, at a time like this (at the wrong time), the surrendering that is done (by having contempt for the Self and succumbing) to the things to be enjoyed (to unworthy recipients), while being intoxicated by the enjoyments (without caring) – that is called “tamasic charity.”"
"23,24","“OM Tat Sat” – it is said that these are three ways (names) of invoking Brahman. By these, the brahmins, all of the Vedas, and all of the yajnas [rites] were brought about in ancient times (brought into being [from the attribute-less state], or enjoined with attributes). For this reason, acts of scripturally directed yajnas, charity and austerities by those who follow Brahman are always begun by uttering the syllable “OM.” ","Just as: if the [Sanskrit] word “go” [meaning: cow] is said, an animal with horns, tail and loose skin around the throat comes to mind – similarly, “OM Tat Sat” – each of these three words/sounds is a seed (invocation) to bring about the state of Brahman in the mind/heart – meaning: these three are three types of names for Brahman. “Name” brings about the experience of Shakti [Divine Power]. Because the Brahman-Shakti is spoken of as three types, He has these types of names. “OM” means the causal aspect of Brahman; that is verily the Shakti of knowing. “Tat” means the subtle aspect of Brahman; that is verily the operative Shakti; and “Sat” means the physical aspect of Brahman; that is verily the Shakti of things/manifested creation. At the happening of creation, it is from these three states of Brahman – OM Tat Sat – that these three Shaktis, respectively – brahmins, Vedas and yajnas have been created – meaning: the Non-attributed Brahman in the form of OM Tat Sat has made Himself appear with the attributes of brahmin, Veda and yajna. The Non-attributed Brahman is indeed the Non-diminishing State. These three Shaktis of His – observer, observation, observed; knower, knowledge and the object of knowledge; or doer, doing, that which is done – in these forms – are ever existing, or beginning-less and endless. From “OM,” the Shakti of knowing is manifested; that Shakti of knowing is the observer or knower. That is verily “brahmin” and the utterance of the causal aspect. From “Tat” manifests the operative Shakti. That operative Shakti is verily Veda [or: observation] or knowledge, by which “brahmin” or the knower operates. This is verily the utterance of operation. Operation is manifested in causality itself. That is why causality and operation appear as inseparable. From “Sat” manifests the Shakti of things endowed with the five elements. That Shakti of things is verily yajna [rite that brings about fruits], which issues forth different forms of fruits and thereby composes the universe. This is verily the utterance of manifestation. That is why the followers of Brahman (those who discuss about Brahman), at the time of beginning the acts of yajna, charity and austerities, in order to maintain purity and completeness, begin the scripturally directed acts with the utterance of OM, the causal aspect of the act to be done."
25,"“Tat” – uttering this sound, those who long for Liberation abandon all aim for results [of any act], and perform the acts of yajna, austerity and charity [without desiring results].","And those who long for Liberation, they utter the sound “Tat” which is the operative aspect of the endeavor for Liberation, and thereby they leave behind any hankering for results. And only for the sake of Liberation, perform yajna, charity, austerities and different acts."
"26,27","For the states of “sadbhava” [goodness; state of existence] and “sadhubhava” [sagaciousness], the aspect of “Sat” [the word] is used. O Partha [Arjuna]! The word “Sat” is also connected to auspicious (beneficent) acts. The settledness [realization of the act] that is there in yajna, austerities and charity – that is called “Sat” [that which is “here and present”]. The act dedicated to “That” (meaning: performed for the sake of pleasing the Lord) is also called “Sat” [act belonging to Truth].","“Sadbhava” and “sadhubhava” [see Bengali translation above] – both of these are one thing. “Sa” = fine breath; “a” [long form] = “aasakti” [connectedness]; “dha” = “dhriti” [holding]; and “u” = “sthiti” [being established]. When, upon being connected to the subtle/fine breath, the settledness is held – that is when the meaning of the word “sadhu” [sage] opens up. Thus, “sadbhava” or “sadhubhava” means the Settled State of Only-ness. And the act that is done for the sake of that kind of settledness (the driving of vayu [vital-force] in the path of Emancipation), O Partha [Arjuna; the sadhak]! – that is also given the name of “Sat.” Similarly, the settledness that comes about from [doing] yajna, austerity and charity, where not a bit of restlessness remains – that is also called “Sat.” And that driving of vayu (in the path of Brahman) that is done for that yajna, those “austerities and offerings” – that is also known in the community of spirituality by the word “Sat.” “Sat” is the utterance of settledness/existence and the Shakti of the state of manifestation. In the path of pravritti [outward-going life] this manifestation appears as the universe, and in the path of nivritti [inward-going life], the manifestation is the realization of Only-ness."
{28}{stop},"O Partha [Arjuna]! The fire offerings, charity upon doing yajna [fire-rite], performance of austerities, and whatever else is done with unbelief/irreverence – all of that is considered “asat” [wrongful]. (Therefore,) those acts (because of being with wrong qualities [or: no good qualities]) do not produce fruits either in the hereafter or (because of being impotent) in this world.","O Arjuna! When the oblations, charity and austerity are done with unbelief/irreverence right from the start (like: I do not believe in oblations and yajnas, but because the women in the house desire it, I have to do it – this kind of thinking in the mind) – that is called “asat” [wrongful]. The performance of such asat acts cannot bring forth any beneficence (like trying to make a deaf person happy with beautiful melodies) either here or in the hereafter. — Start Chapter Conclusion — Diet, yajna, austerities and charity – if they are carried out with rajasic and tamasic states of mind, asuric [demonic] states come to the life-force. If they are carried out with sattvic states of mind, the daivic [godly] states come about. In asuric states, one is not able to have the right to knowledge. It is in the godly states that one is able to have the right to knowledge. That is why the Lord bestows this teaching in this seventeenth chapter [of the Bhagavad Gita]: abandon rajasic and tamasic faith, and take up sattva-filled faith. Then you will have the right to spiritual knowledge. — End Chapter Conclusion — "
