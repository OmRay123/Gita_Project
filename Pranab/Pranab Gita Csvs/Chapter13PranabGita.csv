1,"Arjuna said: “O Keshava [Sri Krishna]! Prakriti and Purush, the field and the knower of the field, knowledge and the knower of knowledge – I wish to know about these.”","The sadhak is observing: this effort of the self to unite with the Self, which I have understood to be “bhakti-yoga” – in this, there are vrittis [active properties] that are standing there, some of which are adversarial, and some of which are supportive. But the foundation of both of the adversarial and supportive vrittis is the same. For as long as the root of that foundation is not destroyed – for that long, it is hopeless to attain any permanent fruit from the union of the self with the Self. That foundation, which is the power in all things – that foundation too is founded on something else. Even though She is the all-doing Shakti [power], She keeps Herself present [fully evident] while [at the same time] admitting to being under the power of a certain Truth [not necessarily evident]. There is no kind of atom of subatomic particle [created and controlled by] this Mahashakti [great power] that does not have this Truth stealthily hidden in it (like the space that is within a brick, stone, vessel or lamp [and such]). This Truth, with Its hidden way of being, is the Lord of the Consciousness of that Mahashakti. These two supremely venerable spiritual aspects are standing in front of me in the same kind of way. Who among these is Prakriti, and who is Purush? Furthermore, what is the field? And who is the knower of the field? That by which the field and the knower of the field are known – what exactly is that knowledge/wisdom? And again, the thing that is to be known – what actually is that? O Keshava! Now explain these very things to me."
2,The Lord said: “O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! This body is known by the name “kshetra” [field]. The one who knows this [body] (meaning: the one who is its knower and is present as its witness) – the knowers of the Self call that being “kshetrajna” [knower of the field].”,"This body is called “kshetra” [field]. The reason is this: just as when a seed is planted on a field, it grows with the aid of the atmosphere, according to the particular qualities of the soil and the acts of the farmer, and thereby, a result that is according to the nature of the seed comes forth – similarly, in this body too (for sure the fruits of karma [actions] come about, but even besides that), when the guru-given seed is sown, through prana-yoga, the influence of spiritual desire, the operations of the gunas and their subsequent results, the desired fruit comes forth. The spiritually knowledgeable ones, after investigating the workings and causalities of this body, have observed that this [body] is built on twenty-four substances, and that it has: three types of forms – physical, subtle and causal; five types of sheaths – “annamaya” [food-sheath], “pranamaya” [prana-sheath], “manomaya” [mind-sheath], “vijnanamaya” [intellect-sheath] and “anandamaya” [bliss-sheath]; and three types of states – waking, dreaming and dreamless/deep sleep. They have also witnessed that – apart from the physical, subtle and causal forms, and beyond the five sheaths – there is One Who is Satchitananda [Truth-Consciousness-Bliss] Itself, One Who is the witness of the three states. That is the One Who is called “Atma” [Self]. It is That Being that is the “I” of the Cosmos – meaning: the Knower and the Witness. “Ahameko’pi sookshmashcha jnAtA sAkshee sadavyayah” [I am verily the one who is the subtle and the ever-undiminished knower and witness]. This “aham” [“I”; see first word of the preceding Sanskrit phrase] is verily the “knower” in the statement “etadyo vetti” [the one who knows this; see second line of sloka 13:2 above]. Thus, the spiritually knowledgeable ones call that One “kshetrajna” [knower of the filed]. — Begin Footnote. — But the sadhak [aspirant] who, while endeavoring to gain self-knowledge through the practice of sadhana, goes on ascertaining knowledge about this body from head to toe – that person is also “kshetrajna” [knower of the field]. This is because that person, while going on endeavoring to merge his/her consciousness in that “I”, [in due course] attains that Self, and becomes that “I”. Srimat Shankaracharya and Sridharswami [historically renowned spiritual scholars], in their commentaries to this sloka, have spoken about this particular type of “kshetrajna” [the enquiring aspirant as the “knower”]. However, regarding the next sloka [13:3 of the Bhagavad Gita], when commenting on the Lord’s statement – “kshetrajnaṃchApi mAṃ viddhi” [know that I am the knower of the field[s]], Shankaracharya deva says that it is not enough to know just that little bit about the “kshetrajna” [the aspirant as the knower of the field[s]]; the One Who presides on all fields as the Supreme God, Who is One without a second – that is the One Who is [the Ultimate] “Kshetrajna” [Knower of the field[s]. It is only then [that the knowledge is revealed] that both [aspirant and God] are the “knowers of the field[s]]; the sadhak who is knowledgeable in the science of the body is “kshetrajna,” and the Supreme God is “Kshetrajna” as well. In sloka 4 [of Chapter 13 of the Bhagavad Gita], the Lord says that He will speak about “sa cha yo yat prabhAbhashcha” [who that is and how that one’s presence is], but nowhere in the chapter does He clearly speak about the signs of the “kshetrajna.” While not speaking such [the signs of the “kshetrajna”], what He did is this: He said that certain qualities like humility and such are knowledge/realizations brought about by jnana-sadhana, and later, through slokas such as “jneya yattat prvakshyAmi” [I shall tell you about that which is to be known] etc., He described the signs of the object of knowledge. Through this, the answers to Arjuna’s questions regarding knowledge and the object of knowledge were given, and, as well, the identity of the knower of the field was also described. By this, it can be surmised that the one who has the qualities/realizations of jnana-sadhana such as humility, etc. – later, as one becomes adept at the yoga of the object of knowledge and the application of such knowledge, and becomes “sannyasi” [extinguished in the Self] and a “knowledgeable one” – that one is also “kshetrajna” – the sadhak who is the knower of the science of the body and the One who is the Pure “Knower of the field[s],” by knowing Whose Presence, Immortality is attained. That is verily That which is to be known. That One’s signs and such are stated in slokas 13 to 18 [of Chapter 13 of the Bhagavad Gita] through [statements] such as “anAdimaṃ paraṃ brahma” [the Beginning-less Supreme Absolute]. The sadhak should remember that the Lord’s explanation of the two Prakritis, “para” and “apara,” in Chapter 7 [of the Bhagavad Gita] are [actually] stated [as well] in two places in this Chapter [13 of the Bhagavad Gita], respectively as “kshetra” [field] and “kshetrajna” [knower of the field], and “Prakriti” and “Purush.” The names are completely different. The differences among [the subjects] are minimal. — End Footnote. —
The matters about the body that have been just stated – in order to make one understand this, and [as well], in relation to this, the description of the field that is in the sixth and seventh slokas – in order to make [all of] that easier to understand, a summarized version of Srimat Shankaracharya’s elucidations about the process of emergence of the twenty-four substances in this body, [his] explanations regarding the physical, subtle and causal bodies, and [his] teachings on the five sheaths and the three states of being is presented herewith.
 
When speaking about the process of emergence of the [primal] substances, the venerable Shankaracharya, right at the start, said, “brahmAshrayA sattvarajastamoguNAtmikA mAyA asti” [being situated in Brahman is the sattva-rajas-tamas-guna-endowed Maya]. It was necessary to accept this bit in order to speak about the process of emergence [of the substances]. This bit is indeed that which is called “the aspect of accepting that which is in the scriptures” or “the acceptance of an axiom.” It is not at all possible for any elucidation to take place within any scripture without the acceptance of certain axioms, [which is done for] the purpose of answering opposing methodologies. That these types of axioms are true can be understood/seen [without analysis], but they cannot be explained by proof. For this reason, these [axioms] are called “aprameya satya” [truths that are not to be proved].
 
Space is realized simultaneously with that tri-guna-endowed Maya. After that: air [appears] from space, fire [appears] from air, liquidity (water) [appears] from fire, and earth [appears] from liquidity – in this way, the emergence of the five elements takes place.
 
In these five elements, from the sattvic part of space, simultaneously [with the emergence of space], the hearing-sense is realized; from the sattvic part of air, simultaneously [with the emergence of air], the touch-sense is realized; from the sattvic part of fire, simultaneously [with the emergence of fire], the sight-sense is realized, from the sattvic part of water, simultaneously [with the emergence of water], the taste-sense is realized; and, from the sattvic part of earth, simultaneously [with the emergence of earth], the scent-sense is realized.
 
In these five elements, from the rajasic part of space, simultaneously [with the emergence of space], the speech-sense organ is realized; from the rajasic part of air, simultaneously [with the emergence of air], the hand/hands-sense-organ is realized; from the rajasic part of fire, simultaneously [with the emergence of fire], the foot/feet-sense-organ is realized; from the rajasic part of water, simultaneously [with the emergence of water], the sex-organ/urinary-sense organ is realized; and from the rajasic part of earth, simultaneously [with the emergence of earth], the anus-sense-organ is realized.
 
From the tamasic part of all of these five elements comes forth the “panchikaran” [the transformation of the senses from their subtle to their gross forms] of the five elements with their five types of activities – in the following way.
 
The tamasic part of all of these five great elements [and “panchikaran”]: takes every one of these elements and divides each of them into two halves [making a total of ten halves]. Keeping five of these halves unaltered, divide the other five halves equally into four parts. Join the four divisions of each of the latter-stated five halves into each of the first five [unaltered] halves, [and with every such joining,] leave out the part that is the same element as the element to which a group of four are being joined [for example: fire, water, air and earth become joined to the unaltered half of space; the latter-divided space-fragment is not included]. This makes the “panchikaran.” Through “panchikaran,” physicality is attained, and therefore, the senses can function/grasp. In the “non-panchikaran” state, because [the senses are in their] subtle [condition], they cannot function/grasp. In the “panchikaran” state, all elements are mixed together. That is to say: in whatever we see that is made of earth, there are eight annas/parts [50%; or: the unaltered half] of the earth-element, two annas/parts [12.5%] of the water-element, two annas/parts [12.5%] of the fire-element, two annas/parts [12.5%] of the air-element, and two annas/parts [12.5%] of the space-element. Similarly, in water, there are eight annas/parts [50%] of the water element and two-annas/parts [12.5%] of each of the other four elements. It is the same with all of the other elements.
 
It is from these five great elements with their five operations that the physical body is born. For this reason, the microcosm and the macrocosm arise at the same time.
 
What the non-manifested five primal elements are and what the manifested five primal elements are in this process of emergence of the substances have now been explained. Now, how the physical, subtle and causal bodies are – that is being explained.
 
The body that is created (built) by the manifested/apparent version of the five great elements, arises from good and bad karmas, is the residence (place) of the experiences of pleasure and pain and such, and is that which [has the qualities of] “asti” (staying [temporarily]), “jayate” (being born), “vardhate” (growing), “viparinamate” (changing), “apaksheeyate” (deteriorating), [and] “vinashyati” (being destroyed) – endowed with these six mutations/modifications. That is verily the physical body.
 
The body that is created (built) by the non-manifested/non-apparent version of the five great elements arises from good and bad karmas, is the place of the process (causal activity) of experiences of pleasure and pain and such, and is endowed with the five organs of perception, the five organs of action, the five pranas, mind and intellect – these seven faculties. That is verily the subtle body.
 
And that which is the unutterable, beginning-less form of Avidya [primal non-knowing], the cause of the dual bodies of the physical and the subtle, that which veils the Knowledge of the Self-Itself, and is not conceptualized [or: unmodified] – that is verily the causal body.
 
Due to the operations of these three bodies, three states are experienced by the jiva [individual soul]. Those three states are: waking, dream and deep sleep. When, through the organs of perception, such as hearing etc., there is the awareness of the matters of sound and such – that is when there is the waking state. This is the activity of the physical body. The soul that has physical-body-vanity/physical-body-identification is actually “vishwa” [universe] itself; this type of statement is made.
 
Whatever is seen during the waking state, whatever is heard [during that state] – the “reality” that is experienced during sleep comes from the desires born of those [sensory experiences]. That is verily the state of dream. This is the activity of the subtle body. The soul that has subtle-body-vanity/subtle-body-identification is “taijas” [energy; light; power]; this type of statement is made.
 
“I do not know anything at all. I am happily enjoying sleep.” This is verily the state of deep sleep. This is the activity of the causal body. The soul that has causal-body-vanity/causal-body-identification is “praajna” [experiencer/knower]; this type of statement is made.
 
The five “koshas” [sheaths] of the body are thus: “annamaya,” “pranamaya,” “manomaya,” “vijnanamaya” and “anandamaya.” [See following paragraphs for the definitions and explanations of the names of the sheaths.]
 
That which arises from the food-essence, grows by the food-essence, and is disintegrated in the Earth, which is made of the food-essence – that is verily the “annamaya kosha” [food-filled sheath] – meaning: the physical body.
 
That which is called the “pranamaya kosha” [prana-filled sheath] is that which has the five vayus [vital-airs] such as “prana” etc., and the five organs of action such as speech/mouth etc. That which is called “manomaya kosha” [mind-filled sheath] is that which has the five organs of perception connected to the mind. Similarly, that which is called the “vijnanamaya kosha” [intellect-filled sheath] is that which has the five organs of perceptions connected to the intellect. These three sheaths exist and operate in the subtle body.
 
And thus, the impure primary substance that exists and operates within the causal body, which is situated in Avidya [primal non-knowing], and is endowed with vrittis [functionalities] such as dearness etc. – that is verily the “anandamaya kosha” [bliss-filled sheath].
 
So go the five sheaths. My body, my prana/s, my mind, my intellect, my knowingness – all of these are known by oneself automatically. And in that way, in the worldly abode of senses, it is “my” sound that happens; the “I” Itself does not sound; instead, all of that [which happens] is known to be separate from “I”. Similarly, in the five sheaths too – it is my sound that happens [in all of the sheaths]. All of these [happenings] are not “I” or the Self. So then how is the Self? Oh but like this: “sacchinAndaroopah” [Existence, Knowingness, Bliss] – meaning: the Self. “Sat” [that which is] = the One Who Is – [and is] in all three aspects of time [past, present, future]; “Chit” = Awareness/Knowingness Itself; and “Ananda” [Bliss] = Happiness Itself. This Self Who is Sacchidanda [or: Satchitananda] Itself is the One Who is the Knower of the field[s]."
3,O Bharat [Arjuna]! Know that I am the Knower of all of the fields. The knowledge of the field and of the knower of the field – that is considered by Me to be [real] knowledge.,"That field that was just spoken about – because all of that – from a fragment of ash to Maya itself – ends, the meaning of “nashvara” [rulership that ends] applies to these [manifestations] – meaning: all of these are “asat” [untrue]. And that [Eternal] Substance that has been spoken about – because That is the refuge of all of these finite things/beings, and because It is Itself “Sat” [True] and Unending, It is called their “Ishvara” [God/Lord] ([see] Chapter 18, sloka 61 [of the Bhagavad Gita]). That True Unending [One] is the thing that is to be known by the untrue and finite ones. And further, whatever is inside and outside these finite ones, the finite ones themselves know nothing at all about that. But that Supreme God is the Knower of each and every one of their atoms and particles. That is why He is “Kshetrajna” [Knower of the fields]. This world that is sitting in front [of you] – investigate and come to know these [things in this world] one by one. See which one of these is “you.” If you do this, you will see that not a single one of these is “you.” This is because everything that comes and goes is impermanent; all of that is “asat” [untrue]. That which is Permanent, “Sat” [True] – O Arjuna! That is that which is “You.” That is why I am saying that each body is itself this singular field. However, in the physical vision, they [the parts of the singular field] are seen as distinct and separate. But just as primal space is inside and outside every physical thing – similarly, the “I”, as the True and Pure Substance, is inside and outside all of the untrue and finite ones. It is because of that that all of the knowledge of all of those fields – meaning: all that is to be known [or: all that is knowable], “I know all of that.” That is why “I” am the Knower of the field[s]. This field that is finite and untrue, and this “I” that is the Supreme God, Unending and True – the Knowledge of these two – according to Me, this Knowledge is true knowledge."
4,"That field – which is seen – which is changeable – the thing from which it [that field] emerges and its [the source’s] form – and how that One is, and what the powers are of that One – hear about that, in brief, from Me.","The field that was spoken about just previously – how that field – in the form of the body – is, how it is endowed with the natures of physical visibility and such, how it is endowed with the ways of desire and such, how it is enjoined with the sense-organs and such, how it arises from the union of Prakriti and Purush, and how the different manifestations are – from a stone to living beings and such – and, as well, the Knower of that field, that True Substance, through Whose Glory that untrue field is colored with manifestations of Truth – what That One is and what That One’s Powers are – I am now telling you about that in a condensed way. Listen."
5,(The particular knowledge of that field and that knower of the field) have been sung (spoken) by many sages in many ways. And it has also been sung by analytical practitioners seeking confirmation by citing aphorisms regarding Brahman.,"Sages such as Vashishtha etc. have expounded, in many ways, about the field and the knower of the field. In the Vedas too, such as the Rig [Veda] etc., there are many different types of descriptions. And the reason and analysis oriented practitioners, who are free of doubts, have made statements and left works regarding Brahman (“athAto brahmajijnAsA” [henceforth, the enquiry regarding Brahman] and such Vedanta sutras and statements in the Upanishads). There are explanations in those [works] as well. All of those expositions are extensive and not easy to grasp fully. That is why the Lord begins to tell Arjuna about the field and the knower of the field in a summarized way."
"06,07","All of the five “mahabhootas,” “ahamkar,” “buddhi,” “Avyakta,” the ten “indriyas,” “and one more,” and the five objects of the senses, “icchha,” “dvesha,” “sukha,” “duhkha,” “samghaat” (body), “chetana” and “dhriti” – this is a summarized description of the mutation-oriented “kshetra.”","From the Brahman-refuged tri-guna-endowed Maya arises space, from space [emerges] air, from air [emerges] fire, from fire [emerges] water, from water [emerges] earth. These five are the “mahabootas” [primal elements]. What this means is that these are the unformed subtle elements that permeate all manifestations (like ghee within milk); the elements in the state prior to “panchikaran” [manifestation process of the elements; see commentary to sloka 13:2 of the Pranab Gita], the elements that are in their original, non-mutated state, the elements that are not [in this state] perceivable/graspable by the sense-organs – those are called the “mahabootas,” verily. The antahkarana [four-sectioned operating group of personal consciousness] is formed by the sattvic part of the aggregate of those elements. Through the differences in their vrittis [functionalities], that one antahkarana can be perceived as having four aspects. For volition and non-volition, [there is “manas” [mind]];4 for ascertainment and confirmation, there is “buddhi” [intellect]; for self-oriented identifications – meaning: “I” – “I am like this,” “I am like that” – when this type of vritti [active tendency] is taken up, there is “ahamkar” [ego], and the rumination (contemplation) of that which is done [or: to be done] is [performed by] “chitta” [personal consciousness]. “Avyakta” is Maya, endowed with sattva, rajas and tamas gunas. That which cannot be expressed by speech – that is that which is called “Avyakta” [inexpressible; unexpressed]. The ten “indriyas” [sense-organs] are: the five organs of perception and the five organs of action. “And one more” is mind [as a whole]. These are referred to as the eleven “indriyas” [sense-organs]. The five “perceivables” of the senses are: sound, touch, the visible, taste, and scent. The perceivable of the auditory sense is sound; for the somatosensory sense, it is touch; for the eyes, it is form; for the gustatory sense, it is taste; and for the olfactory sense, it is scent.

“Icchha” [desire] – attachment/addiction for [something]; it is the [wish] for the company of something/someone other than me. It is like: the satisfaction that comes from drinking sugared lime-juice sitting while under a banyan tree in the desert-like heat – and then when the same situation happens again, the wistfulness of remembering that previous time, or wanting that same satisfaction from the same thing at that time – that is that which is called “icchha” [want; desire].
 
“Dvesha” [repulsion; hate] – after finding oneself in a jungle of thorny bushes in a dark night, and then, after suffering greatly, finding relief by God’s Grace – the inner feeling that rises up when the memory of that event and state comes about – that is that which is called “dvesha” [repulsion; hate].
 
“Sukha” [pleasing state] – the attainment of something that is supportive. “Duhkha” [painful/sorrowful state] – the attainment of something that is not supportive. (The state that the mind takes on after “sukha” [pleasure] changes into its next phase is called “duhkha” [dissatisfaction; pain; sorrow].)
 
“Samghaat” [organic whole] – unperturbed union – meaning: the union of the atoms and particles have brought about such a state that there is no perception of even a perforation of separation in them in any way. Being like this is called “samghaat.” It is like this: the way that the innumerable atoms and particles are built together – it is as if there is nothing but oneness in this aggregate and there is no doubt that arises that these are not one – oneness like that. This delusion that makes one think that this evident unreality is the Real – this is that which is called “samghaat.”
 
“Chetana” [operating consciousness] – like iron, even though it is by nature dark, hard and cold, becomes pliant, bright and burning hot by the intense application of fire, and just as this is not the actual nature or way of iron – similarly, when Consciousness comes into the impermanent, non-substantial things such as the sense-organs of the body, the consciousness-like activities that are seen – that is that which is called “chetana” [operating consciousness].
 
“Dhriti” = the power of firm holding. The power that allows one to not break off [of an activity or process] because of weariness [physical or mental]. These attributes such as “icchha” etc. are perceivable/visible. Therefore, they are not of the dharma of the Self. They are of the dharma of mind. Therefore, they are the aspects of “kshetra” [see following paragraph].
 
All of these are mutations/mutable. And these mutations, with their presence making up this world and [other] worlds – this is that which is called “kshetra” [field]. Thus is the summarized exemplification (description) of “kshetra.”"
"08,09,10,11,12","Not having self-importance, non-deceit, non-violence, compassion/patience, transparency in behavior, service to sadguru, cleanliness in the external and internal, steadiness on the path to liberation, physical self-control; detachment to the worldly experience, being devoid of egotism, being aware of the painful evil of birth, death, old age and illness; non-attachment to children, spouse, home and such, not feeling oneself to be happy or unhappy because of the [happiness or] unhappiness of one’s children and such, being steady-minded in either good or bad occurrences; unwavering devotion to Me through single-minded yoga, residing in solitude, having a dislike for society; full immersion in spiritual knowledge, and being aware of the goal (Liberation) of the knowledge of Truth – it is said that these, numbering twenty, comprise “jnana” [knowledge]. That which is opposite to this [knowledge] is that which is called “ajnana” [ignorance].","When the Presence of the Knower of the field is known, Immortality is attained. That Knower of the field is also the substance to be known. The Lord speaks about the object of knowledge in the very next statement through statements such as “jneyaṃ yattat pravakshyAmi.” In order to know the substance that is to be known, in order to do the practice to know that wisdom, some qualities such as “amaanitva” [not having self-importance] etc. are necessary. Those qualities such as “amaanitva” etc. are stated by the Lord to be “jnana” [knowledge or acquired qualities that are permanent] that is necessary for the practice of attaining the Knowledge of Truth. Those [qualities] are [or: that “knowledge” is comprised of]:
 
(1) “Amaanitva” [not having self-importance/non-vanity]: “maan” [self-importance/self-orientedness] means delusion of oneself. All of the delusion that there is with oneself is that which is called “sambhram” [associated delusion] or “maan.” Allowing “whatever I am not” to enter into “I” is called “maan.” When that total delusion or acceptance [of the delusion] has an “a” come and stand in front of it [prefix], then the meaning of that acceptance [of self-oriented delusion], or the total delusion itself disappears, and a new meaning appears. Abiding at all times in this new state [of not having self-importance] is called “amaanitva” [being unaware of self-importance]. (2) “Adambhitva” [non-deception; personal transparency] – “dambha” means “deception” – meaning: what I am actually not – showing that sort of pretense (showing off) and endeavoring to cheat/fool people with that pretense is called “dambha” [deceitfulness]. Remaining at all times devoid of the activities of that state is called “adambhitva” [being in a state of non-deception; being personally transparent]. (3) “Ahimsa” [non-aggression] – the non-arising of maleficent functionalities within one’s inner being is called “ahimsa.” (4) “Kshanti” [forgiveness] – the forgiveness that is given even towards the wrongful acts of enemy-powers is that which is called “kshanti.” (5) “Aarjav” means – being simple and honest. (6) Taking refuge in and serving the teacher is called “acharyopasana.” (7) “Shaucha” [cleanliness] – getting rid of the impurities of mind/heart is called “shaucha” [purity]. Sound, touch, sight, taste, smell – these five worldly experiences, and ignorance, pride, attraction, repulsion, fear of death – these five afflictions – [these ten together] are called “impurities of the mind.” Washing off the impurities of the body with water is also called “shaucha” [cleanliness]. Becoming clean is also called “shaucha.” And during the state when the mind is still, and no vrittis [inner activities] arise – the unchanging Stillness that is experienced – that is that which is called “shaucha.” (8) Remaining unmoved even at the time of the events of anxiety is called “sthairya” [steadiness]. (9) The effort to destroy body-vanity/body-identification through special Kriya is that which is called “atmavinigraha” [effort to not hold on to self-orientedness]. (10) “Indiryartheshu vairagya” [detachment from the matters of the sense-organs] – meaning: the experiencing of the worldly experience through the ten sense-organs, and the enjoyment/partaking in them – exercising detachment towards them. (11) Having an acute perception regarding the painful wrongness of “janma-mrityu-jara-vyadhi” [birth, death, old-age and illness] – birth itself is pain/sorrow, as there is pain in the womb, and the pain of birthing-labor is full of suffering. That is why it belongs to “wrongness.” Similarly, the pain of death is an extreme suffering; thus, this also belongs to pain and wrongness. In old age, the mental acumen and the vital force diminish; therefore, this is also pain and wrongness. Similarly, illness is also pain and wrongness. For the jiva [embodied soul] the experiencing of all of these sufferings is inevitable. When there is repeated discussion/analysis about these sufferings and wrongs, detachment towards the body and its sense-organs comes about. Effort ensues towards the renunciation of self-orientedness, and in the end, the Self is witnessed. Therefore, whenever whichever vritti [active tendency] rises within the antahkarana [mind as a whole], one should see that very vritti as the seed of rebirth. Ascertaining that very vritti as the pain of birth, the pain of death, the pain of illness, and thereby destroying that vritti is also jnana-sadhana, and that is why [this awareness of the pains and wrongs] is addressed by the word “knowledge.”
 
“Aasakti” [addiction; attachment] etc.: the best of the things of enjoyment in samsara are children, spouse, and property and such. (13) Not being “aasakta” [addicted; attached] to them and (14) to totally renounce all desire to be together with them. (15) Not having any impressions take hold in the chitta [personal consciousness] by not taking in good or bad when they come about; the chitta remains as is; remaining vigilant in this kind of way at all times.
 
(16) It is “I” Who am “Rama” [the Delightful One; the Beloved] – the unbroken endeavor of “avyabhicharini” [non-adulterous] devotion towards that “I”. (“Vyabhichar” [deviant nature; adulterer-nature] is the name of active functionalities operating in the direction of the worldly experience.) (17) Desolate riversides, mountains, solitary places, cremation grounds or places near them, places of battle,6 sacred places – these are secluded lands and places of sadhana [spiritual practice]; although naturally clean, [further] cleaning these places with cow-dung and such and making use of [these places for spiritual practice]. So goes it for the external. And for the internal: those places such as Muladhar etc. that are in the brahmanadi within the sushumna are the secluded lands; making use of them with the guru-instructed methods. (18) The kinds of people who do not have [spiritual] culture – stopping intimate and distant [or: inner and outer] behavior with them – meaning: not associating with them.
 
[6 Translators’ note: The word used here is “ranasthal” which means “place[s] of battle.” It is very possible that the intended word was “aranyasthal” which has a similar combination of letters with a slight variation and which means “forest dwelling[s].” “Aranyasthal” would fall into the category of “secluded places.”]
 
(19) To know that the “I-ness” pervades every atom and particle of the world – from Brahmaa [the creator] to inanimate objects and to the end of creation – fully digesting this understanding with total surety is called “adhyAtmajnAnanityatvam” [ever being in spiritual knowledge]. (20) “Tattva” [substance; science in the complete sense] is the universe. The goal of the knowledge of this tattva is Brahman, the One Who is Supreme, without any conflict. To merge these two and make them one, and ignoring the way of samsara is “tattvajnAnArtha-darshana” [seeing the goal of the knowledge of tattva]. These twenty are those that are called “jnana” [necessary knowledge]. And whatever is opposite to this – that is that which is called “ajnana” [non-knowledge; ignorance]. (“tattvajne’si yadA pArtha tuShNimbhava tadA sakhe. yaddṛShTaṃ vishvaroopaṃ me mAyAmAtrAṃ tadeva hi. tena bhrAnto’si kaunteya svasvaroopaṃ vichintaya. muhyanti mArayA mooDhAstastvajnA mohavarjitAh.)"
13,"I am speaking about that which is to be known, knowing which, immortality is attained. That is the Beginning-less Supreme Brahman. It cannot be said to be either “sat” [existent] or “asat” [non-existent].","Through analysis, the sadhak [aspirant] has surmised what “field” and “knowledge” are. Now, the sadhak has come to understand what is the final culmination of knowledge – meaning: that thing that is to be known, the substance that is to be known. The word “jneya” means “the object of knowledge” [or: “the thing that is to be known”]. Whatever there is that can be seen in this world – all of that is indeed with beginning and with end – meaning: they follow the way of creation-preservation-destruction. The object of knowledge for those who follow the way of creation-preservation-destruction is That which has no creation-preservation-destruction – That Itself. This is because whatever whoever is – that person automatically knows oneself quite well. That which is not known by someone – that is of course “the thing to be known” for that being. That is why I am saying: those who are of the dharma of death, [of the experiences that] have beginnings and have ends – for them, “the thing to be known” is That – that which is Beginning-less, Invincible [or: Birth-less], Immortal. Knowing which, this suffering of birth and the fear of death – these disappear. And so, gather up the inner functionalities of the worldly experience, and burn the flow of thought with that Boundless, Beginning-less, Infinite-ness [Brahman], like a clump of iron being in fire. It is when this happens that the jiva [individual soul] is delivered from birth and death, and, because of attaining Brahman-ness, attains Immortality. That Brahman is Alone. It is neither “sat” [existent] nor “asat” [non-existent]. (This is because if either “sat” or “asat” is said, duality is implied. That which is without duality or non-duality – That is verily Brahman.)"
14,"That [Brahman] has hands and feet established fully everywhere, has eyes, head and mouth established fully everywhere, has the hearing sense established fully everywhere, and is pervading all of the substances of the worlds/planes of existence. ","When air does not move [much] in a cloud-covered day, causing an oppressive heat, it is not accurate to say in this case that the sky is without air/wind. This is because air/wind, at this time, stays in a state that is not so apparent. Because the touch sense in the jiva [individual incarnation] is very physical/gross in nature, it cannot feel the touch of that very subtle state of air. The subtle can go into the physical. The physical cannot go into the subtle. This is the reason for this [not being able to experience the subtle air]. Similarly, in the Boundless, Infinite Brahman, hands, feet, eyes, hearing, the head which is the container of mental power, and mouth and such – all of the operative powers that there are in creation, all of them are in the “non-apparent but present” state – like salt in salty water – even covering up space itself in Its abyss. “Tat e” – there is no place where this active power is in lesser or greater amounts. The Essence is One and the same everywhere.

 2nd meaning: when the sadhak [practitioner] knows well the grand play of the cosmos, then he/she sees that in this [cosmos] there is revelation by sattva [guna], operation by rajas [guna] and settledness by tamas [guna]. Other than these three, there is no other essence [of visible creation]. The coming together of these three and becoming one is Maya. That Maya also belongs to “I”. And that non-essential Maya’s mutations are again these three [gunas]. Thus, they are emergence-giving and destructive as well. Furthermore, in this, there are three “taap[s]” [pressures; intensities; heats; tensions]. If there is playing around with phenomena, there is a “taap.” That is called “adhibhautik taap” [phenomena-based “taap”]. Playing around with gods, there is another “taap.” That is called “adhidaivik taap” [subtle-world-based “taap”]. And playing around with the Self, there is [yet another] “taap.” That is called “adhyatmik taap” [spiritual “taap”]. This too is a mutation [not Truth]. When this became known with certainty, then the sadhak, in order to be separate from this [the “taaps”], sat down with a type of Kriya that is an activity devoid of cause (meaning: that by which all doing/causality disappears). The deeper the practice of this Kriya went on, the more the sadhak went on seeing that he/she is separate from everything in every stage. When nothing else at all was able to touch the sadhak again, then contraction ended in the sadhak and magnanimity/openness came forth. In this magnanimity/openness, all of the contracted-ness that there was previously – the sadhak took them too and destroyed their contracted states, brought them in to the state of magnanimity/openness, and merged them [both states] into Oneself. Then, both magnanimity/openness and contraction were in “abhaav” [non-state; gone]. This settled state where both [magnanimity/openness and contraction] are in the state of oneness – this settled state is that which is known as the “tadbrahma” [That Brahman] State of the sadhak. The unripened sadhak comes down from this State to samsara and thereafter understands that the previous state of the sadhak’s own Self is that which is called “Tat” [That] (Brahman) – the “Tat” that has hands and feet fully established everywhere, has eyes, head and mouth fully established everywhere, has hearing everywhere, and is pervading all in all of the worlds/planes."
15,"(That Brahman) pervades, and is present in, the functioning of all of the sense-organs, yet [at the same time] is free from all of the sense-organs (therefore, It is not acting as the functions of the senses), is without attachment to anything, and at the same time, It is the foundation of all. It is without the gunas such as sattva etc., yet It is the director of the gunas such as sattva etc. ","The senses reside indeed in the extremely small and boundary-enclosed body. But the operative Shakti [essential power] of the senses, and the essence of that Shakti – like the scent of the earth-element, the liquidity of the water-element, the sight of the fire-element, the touch of the air-element and the sound of the space-element – is all pervading and spread throughout all. In the state of the sadhak mentioned in the previous sloka, because of being in that expansive form, no sign remains of the boundary-enclosed senses and such. That is why It is free from all senses, yet taking the aspects of indriyas, such as gunas [essential qualities], Shakti, and the reflection of the essence, It remains as the foundation- and sustaining-cause of all, blended in with the expanse. In this state, there are no operations of any of the gunas (because this is a state beyond the gunas). That is why this is without contact/association to anything. But when the operation of gunas takes place somewhere, because it is happening within the expanse, according to the terminology of the world of beings [or: worlds/planes], It exists as the director of the gunas. "
16,"It is outside of all phenomena/living beings, inside and also in the inert. It is also in the moving. Because of Its subtleness it is unknown. It is far and it is also near.","Because this “Tat-Brahman” [That Brahman] is extremely subtle, It exists as the same within and without all phenomena/living beings. Thus, It is also within and without the moving and unmoving. Those who are visionaries of the subtle, because they abide in this subtleness, this “tat” [That] is near them. And those who only see the physical/gross [aspects] do not understand any of the meanings of these words. Therefore, It is far away from them."
17,"Although It is Undivided, It resides within all phenomena/living beings as if It is divided. That Substance that is to be known (during the manifested state [of phenomena]) is the sustainer of all phenomena/living beings. (During the destruction-state [of phenomena]) It is the Devourer, and (during the creation-state), It is actively creating with many operations. ","When smoke floats in the sky, it is true that one sees the sky as if it is filled with smoke. However, just as there is no association (mingling) of the smoke and the sky, no mark of smoke remains on the body of the sky, and the space does not become divided either – in the same way, although the phenomena and the upper expanse is seen as the one and same by the ignorant, the true perception is had by eyes of the jnani [wise], [who sees that Brahman] is Unassociated/Unmixed with anything, always apart [from phenomena] and Undivided. It is like this: one Maya has three gunas – at the time of the activity of the rajoguna, there is the dressing up as Brahmaa [the creator] and the happening of creation; at the time of the activity of sattva guna, there is the dressing up as Vishnu and the operative happenings; and at the time of the activity of the tamoguna, there is the Form of Hara [Maheshvara] and the happenings of destruction. Even though this appears to be so, when the three gunas are in repose, nothing at all remains. Only phenomena/beings – to put it straight – [is/are] “apparently embedded” (like silver in mother-of-pearl, the snake in the rope, the knowledge of water in the thirst of the deer, delusion is itself delusion) – like that."
18,"That is the light of all lights such as the sun etc. (revealer). And it is said to be beyond tamah [darkness] (meaning: untouched by ignorance). (That is that which is) knowledge, the object of knowledge, that which is to be attained through knowledge and is seated (in the hearts) of all living beings as the controller.","“Jyotish” means the moon, sun and fire [and such light-emitting/light-reflecting substances], those whose light removes the darkness perceived by the physical eyes and allows one to see properly. And another “jyotish” is “jyotish-vidya” [astrology], by which, through its mathematical analyses, the projected resolutions of things can be known. And “jyotish” [is also], self-understanding (like: I used to play during childhood; now I am in old age; that place is no more; that time is no more; that participant is also not there; yet I am seeing them in memory as if they are happening now; like that) – that which shows in the future as if it is in the present. These few types of “jyotish” are contents of the aforementioned “Tat.” Therefore, “Tat” is light of even the revealers. This “Tat” is ever-existent on the other side of [is beyond] darkness. This “Tat” is right after the final state of “knowledge” [as stated in slokas 13:8-12]. The object to be known is also this “Tat.” Through knowledge, one has to fall into this “Tat” and take up Eternal Peace. That which is meant by the word “sarva” [all], within its heart – meaning: [“Tat” is] within it, and because It is Boundless, It is also outside that “sarva” – the “Tat” is there in its Fullness. “Sarva” is in the abyss of “Tat,” like the way the Earth is in the abyss of space. "
19,"The field, knowledge and the object of knowledge have now been stated in this summarized way. Knowing this, My devotee becomes fit to attain My State. ","From the primal elements to the foundation is the “field.” From the qualities such as “amaanitva” [not having self-importance] to the witnessing of the goal of spiritual knowledge is “knowledge.” And from “Beginning-less ‘I’” to “residing within the hearts of all” is the “object of knowledge.” I have told you about these in summarized form. The one who is the devotee of “I” (meaning: the one who has suffered the torture of the ocean of samsara and is going to go and merge in “I” and get Emancipation) – if he/she discusses these three matters and becomes aware of the Form of “Tat,” that being will be intoxicated by the State of “I” and will get “I”."
20,Know that both Prakriti and Purush are beginning-less. Know that all permutations and gunas [qualities] manifest from Prakriti.,"[In the seventh chapter [of the Bhagavad Gita], the matter of two Prakritis by the names of “apara” and “Para,” which represent the Lord’s “field and knower of the field” [respectively], have been stated. At that time, it was said that all phenomena and living beings are born of this dual Prakriti. How all phenomena and living beings arise from that dual Prakriti –  signifying the field and the knower of the field – in order to explain that, the Lord is now describing the signs and such of Prakriti and Purush.]
Now the sadhak is enquiring into Prakriti and Purush. “Prakriti”: “pra” = “prakrishta” [most excellent] one who does “kriti” [manifestations]. Therefore, it is now determined that the one who acts is called “Prakriti.” “Purush” is the name of the one who is laying down in the “abode” [or: is completely laying down]. Both of these are “anadi” [beginning-less] (those who have not had birth until even now). “Na [negation] adi [beginning]” = “anadi” [without beginning]. If the meaning of the word “Brahman” is analyzed, [it means:] with the root “briha” = expanse, the great; and “man” means “without limit.” The meaning of the word “Brahman” is “the Great Infinity.” For as far as the rulership of this Great Infinity is, for that far there is no place for anything else; only Brahman is Present. Whatever I can see in the visible world, there is a name for that, a form for that as well. And there are also statements which refer to things that cannot be found, like: “flower in the sky,” “horse’s egg,”  “barren woman’s son,” “camel’s horn” etc. While being under the rulership of the word Brahman, if one wants to understand Maya, Prakriti, and Purush, one should think of them as if they are like those words which refer to nothing that actually exists, like aberrations of imagination or falsehoods. Although those imaginary words/statements have no reality – just as those functions that accompany their meanings are [nevertheless] there, it is the same for the meanings of these words: Maya, Prakriti, Purush. That is why, in order to totally free the jivas [souls] from their suffering, the great sages have said in spiritual teachings (Vedanta philosophy) that only Brahman is True, other than That, everything else – Maya, Prakriti, Purush – is false. When the word “Satya” [Truth] appears, just as, right with that [utterance] (even it is not there), the understanding of an opposing word “mithya” [false] comes about – it is like that with the words Maya-Prakriti-Purush [being false] in the “Satya Brahman” [Brahman-Reality]. Brahman is the Eternal Reality, without mutations. And Maya is impermanent, unreal, and nothing but mutations. Brahman and Maya, like body and shadow – one does not stay without the other. This Maya is inert, non-substantial; and Brahman is Awareness/Consciousness Substance Itself. Through their intense relationship, there comes about a delusional understanding of the non-substantial being substantial (like the reflection of the body in the mirror). It is verily then that Maya dresses up as Brahman – meaning: gives forth the idea that [Maya is] the Real and mutation-less. This inverse dressing-up by Maya – this indeed is “Prakriti.” When this Prakriti became big – it is then that She swallowed Brahman in Her belly, like the sky [being reflected] in the pond, or making a house with covered roof in the great space. Covered roof – the floor is “pur” [abode], and the void within the abyss of that “pur” is “Purush.” Just as the salt-water of the sea, taking on the qualities of fire, air and space, and abandoning its own qualities of saltiness, comes down as pure, satisfying and life-giving substance for the world of beings – similarly, due to residing with the extremely low-level and small [types of] natures, Purush also takes on the name of “jiva” [individual person], and, losing all sensibility, dresses up and sits as Prakriti. That is why this one is called “Para Prakriti.” That is because, although this being is “non-doing,” due to the wrong influence of the company it keeps, it takes on the ill-repute of a vain enjoyer (even if it does not actually take it on). “SaṃsargajA doshaguNA bhavanti” [the wrongness of qualities is born of association]. Therefore, Prakriti and Purush are both beginning-less. And know that all imaginations of mutations and qualities are in Prakriti itself. "
21,"“Karya” [action], “kaaran” [cause] and “kartritva” [doership] are caused by and associated with Prakriti; it is said. And the experiencing of the aggregate of pleasure, pain and such are associated with Purush; it is said.","That Fundamental Prakriti that has been spoken about – that has mutated and become seven – meaning: five tanmatras [essence of the senses] (sound, touch, sight, taste, smell), intellect and ego. This seven are called “prakriti-vikriti” [mutations of Prakriti]. These make up “kaaran” [cause]. And then again, transforming into sixteen, it takes the name of “vikar” [permutations; further changes] – such as: five primal elements (earth, water, fire, air, space); five organs of perception (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin); five organs of action (speech, hands/arms, feet/legs, anus, sex organ) – these fifteen plus mind. The physical body that has come about from the coming together of all of these, that is called “karya” [work; actions]. That is why Prakriti is said to be the cause of actions and causalities. And that Purush? He has no cause. Although He is Boundless, He has gone on to become small due to circumstances, abides in the abyss of the limitedness of Prakriti, and is experiencing pleasure and pain [and such], all born of the qualities of Prakriti. This experiencing is like this: in a pentagonal room there are five corners of space; in a room with seven corners, there are seven corners [of space]; in a circular room the space is circular; like this, [the space] is fragrant in fragrance, full of stench in stench, smokey in smoke – meaning: although space has no such experience within itself, those who are residing in that space go on experiencing those particular pleasures and pains, and the stains of those pleasures and pains go on being smeared on that space which is [actually] unconnected [to the stains and to the residents of that space]. Like this: that space within that room is malodorous, fragrant, smokey, full of darkness etc. Yet, the poor space itself has no such imperfections. Dear sadhak! Here you have your Purush’s experiencing/partaking. Lord! Lord!

It is as if the incredibly beautiful, grand-sport-playing Prakriti’s ascribed attributes make up the roots of the vines of the visible world."
22,The reason for experiencing all of the qualities born of Prakriti is because Purush is within Prakriti. All of the births that take place in its [Prakriti’s] good and bad wombs – the cause of these matters is the association with the gunas. ,"The delusional imaginations that come about within the Limitless due to the transformations (changes) brought about by the activities and causalities of the limited – [they are] like the blue that is seen in the formless sky due to the sky’s depth and the weakness of eyesight. Just as that is never true – in the same way, the lie of the existence of the non-substantial and limited Prakriti in the Still, Limitless Brahman-Substance is just a lie-filled delusion. And the delirium that is the experiencing of that delusion, that delirium is actually “Purush,” as well as “Purush being within Prakriti.” From that kind of delirium rises the delusional experiential functionalities of pleasure and pain [and such] and: “I am happy”; “I am sad”; “I am ignorant”; “I am wise” – these types of distorted concepts [arise], which are like delirium, cutting Brahman into pieces and making up a “Purush,” the experiencer. This is the taking of your attributeless-ness, mixing it with attributes, and giving out the falsehood of calling you “the experiencer of the attributes.” Just as, in the morning, many-colored forms can be seen by the light of the sun’s rays shining on the dew on barley-stalks – meaning: it is like when many kinds of colors can be seen due to the movement of the sun in the dewdrops – it is like that, brother! The qualities of the imaginary Prakritis cause the quality-free Purush to be associated with qualities/attributes. As the qualities of those Prakritis qualities/attributes are brought together within certain perimeters, so are the births of the pieces of Brahman, such as gods, humans etc., taking place in their [appropriate] types of wombs, and [the births of] animals, birds, insects, creepers etc. taking place in lower kinds of wombs. "
23,"Even though He abides in the body, Purush is beyond (meaning: He is separate from Prakriti), and therefore, He is the overseer, the consenter/manager, the experiencer and the Supreme Lord, and, it is also said that He is the Supreme Self.","The farmer is the protector of the farm, the overseer of the good and bad of all things related to farming. Remaining close to all of the crops day and night, he/she has the responsibility of protecting the plants from attack by animals such as rabbits etc. But he/she is not able to do that. So, he/she goes and plants into the middle of the field a straw-lump shaped like a [human] doll, with a black pot for a head, with its hands and feet mounted on bamboo. Seeing that horrifying and ugly form, rabbits and such destructive animals do not approach that field out of fear. It is as if the farmer has delegated to that doll the responsibility of looking after the farm. Thus, that doll is the overseer of that farm. It is like this with the activities and causalities of Prakriti. Even though [Purush] is extremely close to the events and still does not have any true contact, the events of actions and causalities are taking place in front of Purush’s eyes. Because of this, He is called the overseer (whether He actually looks or not).
 
That straw-lump doll – as it (even without actually doing anything) drives away the destructive animals from the farming-related plants of that farmer, [in essence] carrying out the work of the farmer, it is called “consenter/manager.” Similarly, even though Purush has no contact with the events of actions and causalities of Prakriti, because He surrounds Himself with Prakriti’s fence, and thereby imagines the entrapment of Consciousness in the physical, and because the operations of Prakriti go on manifesting, Purush becomes the “consenter/manager” of Prakriti.
 
A connection/relationship observed on Earth is this: the sun is up above, and in the pond on the ground floats the lotus. Because the lotus blooms when the sun comes up in the morning and closes when the sun goes down at dusk – just as poets have superimposed the relationship of “husband and wife” on that sun and lotus [respectively] – similarly, [upon] naming impermanence, ignorance, falseness and delusion as “Prakriti” and dressing it up as “wife,” the word “Purush” has been superimposed on the Eternal, Universal Brahman, and through the power of imagination, both have been “wed” and Purush has been dressed up as “lord.” The world is delusion’s home. In delusion’s home, there is only the delusional influence on a delusional household. Thus, there is the superimposition of an imaginary Prakriti imagining an imaginary Purush being an imaginary lord. Truth is the sustainer of the false. Truth is “Brahman” and the false is “Prakriti.” That is why Brahman is the “lord” of Prakriti.
 
“Bhokta” [consumer; experiencer]: “bhuj” = to do “bhojan” [consume] + “tr” (trin) = a sound denoting “doing” – meaning: the one who consumes. Just as darkness goes away automatically at the rising of the sun – in the same way, at the rising of the Knowledge of Brahman, the delusional web of Prakriti automatically merges into Brahman, and because of this, “Brahman is the consumer of Prakriti” – this false statement has been spread around.
 
This extremely incomprehensible and huge sheath of the universe that you are seeing in front of you, which is beyond the capabilities of the human mind to limit – all of this is nothing but the mutations and permutations of Prakriti. And even more, the one who brings about this universe by Her actions and causalities – that Prakriti Herself is so immense, not even a reflection of conception about that can come about in this tiny heart. Because Prakriti is bigger than everything, Prakriti is called “Mahan” [the Great]. The One in Whom She takes refuge and carries out the Rulership of this drama-garland – because that Purush is Her “Ishvara” [God], Purush is called “Maheshvara” [the God of “the Great”].
 
“Paramatma” [Supreme Self] – (the word “para” means “supreme,” and “am” means “only”) – meaning: the One Who is “Only,” “Supreme” and “Atma” [Self]; “AtmA shuddhah svayaṃjyotir vikAree nirAkṛtih” [the Self is the Pure Formless expression of the Self-luminous Light]. So there we have: the One who is “Only” (Alone), “Supreme,” “Pure,” “Self-luminous,” “Ruler” and “Formless” – that is the One Who is “Paramatma.”
 
O Arjuna! With this body, through becoming erroneous due to the error of contact with the phenomena of the activities and causalities of Prakriti (like a fence), Purush became dressed up with these stated particularities [attributes]. If it were not so, what He is – there is nothing left [any more] for you to know [about that] through analysis. Here you have your Prakriti, the mutations of Prakriti, the permutations, and Purush."
24,"The one who knows Purush to be like this, and [the one who knows] that Prakriti is with attributes – that one, even while being present in every kind of activity, does not again take birth.","The one who clearly knows oneself (one’s own Self – meaning; [the one who knows] the One Who is Pure, Self-luminous, Ruler, Formless – that One) in the aforementioned perspective, and clearly knows Prakriti and Prakriti’s qualities, operations and powers (it will not do to just know in some cursory way; whenever whatever vritti [tendency] arises, even without trying, one will automatically free one’s Purush state from the contact with Prakriti and easily laugh at it, just from the fruits of practice – when it will be like this, only then) – that person’s divisions of time, such as past and future, which have arisen due to the errors of Prakriti, will be destroyed, and a state where one is endlessly in the present at all times will come about. In this state, no rules or restrictions – none of that will be there. The reason is: because of that person having become “all is Brahman,” no functionalities that are seeds of rebirth will at all arise. That being will become “jivanmukta” [Liberated while living in the body]. Thus, no matter in which way he/she is on the outside, because of the absence of birth-causing impressions, that being will never have rebirth again."
25,"Some, through dhyana-yoga, come to know the Self through mental perception within the body. Some others come to know the Self through samkhya-yoga, and some others through karma-yoga.","(The words that have been said about Prakriti, the mutations of Prakriti, the permutations, and Purush – all of that can be known by simply witnessing the Self. In these two slokas [13:25-26] the Lord is showing the differences of the gradually greater levels of [spiritual] capability according to the stages of sadhana, and is speaking about the methods of witnessing the Self.)

When, upon having received instructions from Srigurudev, one progresses in sadhana and the force-strength of prana-driving in the sushumna becomes easy and natural, then, if one does 1728 chaturthik pranayams, the mind will rise up from the worldly experience and the senses, fall into the intellect, and one will have realization of the Self. That process of having Self-realization – that is called “dhyan.” Going on practicing in this way, when the world-oriented current of functionalities is completely controlled [by the sadhak], then, as one wishes, one can separate and take that current away from the weariness of Prakriti, fill it with energy, throw it into Purush and take up endless settledness. This is one type of sadhana [practice]. In this too, the settledness in the Self and the stoppage of the samsaric state come about. (The beginning part of this type of sadhana is “samkhya-yoga” – meaning: “jnana-yoga,” and the beginning part of samkhya-yoga is “karma-yoga.” That is why the Lord has mentioned samkhya-yoga and karma-yoga right after this [“dhyana-yoga”]. The perfected yogis take whichever one of these they wish and witness the Self; however, the practitioner is perfected by rising through the stages in sequence.) "
26,"However, some others who do not know (how to have realization of the Self, with Its signs as overseer and such, through paths such as samkhya-yoga and such), do worship upon hearing from others (meaning: from the scholars/sages). They too, upon taking refuge in the instructed wisdom, go beyond death. ","There are many persons whose gross nature is greater, and [thus] they have a lesser ability to ascertain subtle matters. They are not able to have realization of the Self Itself through paths such as samkhya-yoga and such. They become engaged in worship upon hearing from others – meaning: from scholars/sages. That teaching received from others is their proven wisdom [for progressing]. They themselves do not have discrimination. But they too, gradually, go beyond the death-enjoined samsara. This is because: with the aid of faith/reverence, and upon going on hearing that teaching, there is the gradual manifestation of devotion, which stops their outward-going tendencies. Then the outer teaching transforms into “Naad” [Divine Sound] within. Continuously listening to that Naad, the mind merges into the Vishnu-Substance."
27,"O Bharatarshabha [Arjuna]! All substances (things) that arise, from the inert to living beings – know that all of that happens due to the union of the field and the knower of the field.","That spiritual practice that was just spoken about, the one where Ishvara [the God aspect of a being] breaks through the fences of Prakriti and returns to Boundlessness, the one where the dharma of death (birth and death) is destroyed and Immortality is attained – its most subtle subject-matter (the primary practice) is the knowledge of the union of the field and the knower of the field. O Bharatarshabha [Arjuna]! O Arjuna! For as long as there is the delusional thinking that these two types of imaginary insubstantial things – “sthavar” (the non-moving things) and “jangam” (those that move about) – are eternal and true – meaning: “kshetra” [the field] (the happenings of Prakriti), and “kshetrajna” [knower of the field] (the fence of Maya around Brahman, [an idea that] cannot actually be conceived, [an idea] that is totally opposite in concept [to “kshetra”] and totally unrelated to the other [nonsense]) – [for as long as there is] no understanding of the difference between these two – know that for that long there is the union of the field and the knower of the field. It is like the fear that comes about when seeing elephants, horses, ghosts and ghouls in a dream, but there is no fear when one is awake – in the same way, upon the rising of the Knowledge of Brahman, there is no delusion that remains about some fence of Maya being around Brahman-Substance. Continuously analyzing (through intense practice) Prakriti, the mutations of Prakriti, the permutations, and the state of Purush, the delusion of the union of the field and the knower of the field is torn apart. The seed of rebirth does not remain. Know that this is the teaching of the ultimate practice in order for you to have Liberation. See its clear proof. The day that you sit down to do Kriya and no longer have the desire to attain the paravastha of Kriya, that is the very day that you attain that paravastha. And the days on which you keep that desire – no way does it happen on those days."
28,"The one who sees “Parameshvara” [Supreme God] as residing in all things in the same way, and as Indestructible when all phenomena are destroyed – that is the one who sees all.","“Param” means “only,” “supreme.” And “ishvara” means Brahman enjoined with Maya. There is no light in Prakriti; light is in Purush. The delusional desires, activities and knowing-power that rise up in Prakriti due to the contact with Purush – Prakriti puts those delusions into Purush, takes the light of Purush, dresses up Purush as “lord,” and dresses up Herself as self-luminous and non-doer – that dual-self state is called “Ishvara.” — Begin Footnote. — The iris of the eye is round and small. The amount of great space that can be captured by that power of sight that comes from that iris – that is actually “mahan” [great]. Because the place from which the power of sight issues forth is round – because of that, the amount of space that the sight can capture – all of it seems to be round. Who knows how many irises of eyes are there in that huge sphere; that cannot be counted; it cannot even be determined by thinking. In the same way, within the Totality of Brahman, the number of the spherical mazes [illusion] born of Maya that can be perceived – meaning: the union of Maya and Brahman – within that very area [in Brahman], due to the error of contact with the guna-endowed Maya and the progress of those gunas [qualities], [Brahman] takes the name of [or: becomes] “Saguna Brahman” [Brahman with attributes]. This Saguna Brahman is that which is known as “Ishvara” [personal God]. Within the area run by this Saguna Brahman, there are innumerable Maya-mutated universes and solar systems that have found their places, like those irises of the eyes. The sphere of the eye is far from the sky and is small. And within the Eternal, Unattributed Brahman, the unreal, pure Maya’s place of residence is a lie and is far from Ishvara and small. Because Ishvara has taken Maya as “His own,” He is called “Mayavashi” [under the power of Maya]. And as much as the Sky of Consciousness has come down towards Maya, that much of it is under the power of Maya. The state of being under the power of Maya is “jiva” [embodied soul]. In the particular ways that this jiva has come near Maya – according to those ways, it has taken names according to greater and lesser nearness to Maya, [names] such as gods, demons, humans, animals, birds, insects, plants, stones etc. — End Footnote. — The “Ishvara” that has “only-ness” and “supreme-ness” – that one is called “Parameshvara.” Just as: if a fortress is made with iron walls in the great space – that there is no fragmentation that takes place in space – in the same way, the smearing of Prakritic illusion or falsehoods does not touch Brahman. Even though, in the eyes of the ignorant, space appears to be divided by the walls of the fortress, in the eyes of the wise there is no fragmentation taking place in the great space. Just as [the wise one] sees the one undivided great space inside and outside mountains, walls, trees, stones [and such] – in the same way, the One Parameshvara is present equally, like undivided (without boundaries) space, within everything. Prakritic changes do not make that eternal truth change. The one who has the adeptness to see this – that is the one who sees that which is unknown to others. If the sadhak matches up his/her purvavastha [pre-state] of Kriya, Kriyavastha [during-Kriya-state], paravastha [post-state] of Kriya, and the paravastha of the paravastha of Kriya [post-post-state of Kriya], this delusion will not remain."
29,"Because the person who sees the Supreme Self as abiding in the same way in everything/everywhere, and, therefore, as [that person] does not bring about his/her own destruction – for this reason, [that person] attains the Supreme Destination (Liberation).","The Brahman, Ishvara and Parameshvara that have been spoken about under the previous slokas – there is no place for anything to have any place in them. Because this is like that, there is no place to give instruction. There is no time; [so] there is no way to reveal something called “past” or “future.” Like a sheet of luminous fire-flame, only one Substance (Brahman) is there. This Beginning-less, Infinite Light Itself is “I” Myself. What Prakritic delusion can cause conflict in this Form of Myself? And what is the nature of such delusion? Where does it exist? Staying in an unbroken way in this state of Rulership, one cannot kill/damage oneself because there is no cutting up of the True by the false – meaning: one does not have to destroy the Knowledge “I am the Supreme Self” by coming down to the knowledge “I am the individual person.” One does not have to destroy oneself. Thus, the Supreme Goal (Settledness in Brahman) becomes established automatically."
30,"All actions are being done in every way by Prakriti alone, and the Self is the Non-doer. The one who sees this – that is the one who is the seer of Truth.","Just like little girls playing with their household-dolls in their playrooms are starting to learn the preparation for future enjoyments – in the same way, the first practice for the one who removes that self-killing Maya (that which destroys oneself), in order to reestablish oneself in the Form of the Self, is this enjoyable talk (that which teaches this and allows one to learn). The tri-guna-endowed Prakriti is the Maya [appearing play] of the Lord. Through actions and causalities, this Maya Herself shows Her limitation. Thus, doing and non-doing – She is the master of both of these. That is why the name is “Prakriti” [pro-doing]. Whatever associations of whatever kinds of actions, causalities and doership that may come – all of that verily is this enjoyment-loving Prakriti. “I” – that Infinite Light – am separate and nothing actually [connected to the play] – this direct knowledge is that which shows Oneself to be the Non-doer. The one who has attained this vision through special sadhana [spiritual practice] – that one is seeing Oneself as the Non-doer. "
31,"When one sees the [apparent] separateness of the aggregate of phenomena and living beings existing in a singular place (residing in the One Self), and when one sees that all phenomena and living beings expand forth from That Itself (from that One Self Itself), then (that being) becomes Brahman. ","“This, that, another” – these separate forms of phenomena and living beings that you are seeing – that is the dharma of Prakriti’s making and withdrawing. Removing this perception of separateness from the inner being, all phenomena and living beings become one and expand forth. And the great expanse is actually Brahman. That Brahman is verily “I”. When the spiritually knowledgeable sadhak [aspirant] performs the yajna of Brahman as described in the fourth chapter [of the Bhagavad Gita], then the perception of seeing the Self in all becomes established, and one sees that in the midst of the ocean, there are infinite waves giving off the foam and bubbles of phenomena which are established in One Self alone, and it is from the One Self that they are spreading out in many different forms. When this direct vision is had – it is then that the sadhak attains the State of Brahman."
32,"O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! Because of beginning-less-ness and non-attributed-ness, this Supreme Self is Inexhaustible (the Ruler/Owner). For this reason, even while being in this body, It does nothing and is not enwrapped (by anything).","When the State of Brahman is attained, no conflicts of the body-associated pleasures and pains come about any longer. Only the vision of oneness remains. This is because: That which the Substance of the Supreme Self is – that is Beginning-less and Attribute-less. Therefore [It is] the Ruler. And the Prakritic substance is with beginning and with attributes; therefore [it is] mutation-oriented. For this reason, no marks can be impressed upon that Ruler (like smoke in the sky). That is why it can be said that there is no way for the fences of the attribute-enjoined, beginning-enjoined Prakriti to surround this Beginning-less, Attribute-less, Inexhaustible Supreme Self."
33,"Just as, because of its subtleness, the space that is everywhere is not enwrapped (by anything) – in the same way, even though the Self exists throughout the body, It is not enwrapped. ","That the Supreme Self is not enwrapped even while existing in the body – this is exemplified by space. See – space is everywhere. There is no place or thing in which space is not. Fill this space with smoke; blow dust on it; spray mud on it; try in whichever you can to put impurities on space; you will see that no mark can be made on the body of space. As soon as smoke, dust etc. go away, the same space remains just as space. This is because space is subtle in substance; it does not blend with the gross/physical. Just as this space is not enwrapped by/with anything, yet everything is present within it – just like that, because the Self is subtler than the subtlest, even though it is everywhere, in whatever bodies there are in the cosmos, it is not enwrapped by any actions/operations by anyone/anything."
34,"O Bharat [Arjuna]! Just as the one sun illuminates this entire world – in the same way, the Resider in the field (the Supreme Self) is illuminating the entire field.","O Bharat [Arjuna]! Just as the one sun is illuminating the entire world, yet is not bound to anything/anyone – in the same way, however many fields that there are, the One Resider of the fields (the Self) illuminates all fields, yet is not bound by them. "
{35}{stop},"In the [previously] stated ways, those who, through the eye of knowledge, know the distinctions between the field and the knower of the field, and know the method of Liberation of living beings from Prakriti – they go to the Supreme Truth (Brahman).","That field, the knower of the field, Prakriti, the mutations of Prakriti (phenomena/living beings), and Liberation – meaning: the talk that has been given regarding being apart while being in all of this – in this, that the knower of the field is totally separate from the field, Prakriti, and the mutations of Prakriti – this is proved by the scriptures. And that teaching in the scriptures is proved by the teachings of guru. And the one who vows to do sadhana according to the teachings of the scriptures and the teachings of guru, and thereby directly sees the distinctions between the field and the knower of the field, and directly sees the way to be Liberated from the rulership of Prakriti through methods such as meditation etc., and thus comes to be settled in the Awareness of Self-knowing – for as long as that being remains in the body – for that long that being is jivanmukta [Liberated while living in the body], and upon the dropping off of the body [physical death], [that being] merges into the Infinite Form of Oneself – meaning: into Brahman – and that being never again has rebirth."
