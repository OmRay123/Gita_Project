1,"[Arjuna said:] O Janardan, O Keshava [Sri Krishna]! If in Your perspective “buddhi” [knowledge or faculty of observing and ascertaining] is superior to “karma” [action], then why are you making me take part in such an intense act?","In order to remove the samsara-delusion from the disciple, in the previous Chapter [Chapter 2] Srigurudev [Sri Krishna], upon showing the primal eternal nature of the Self, revealed the sole way (teaching) of the path of sadhana - “uttishtha” [abiding above] – to cut the torrential bondage of the physical births and deaths. He showed that this path has two “kandas” [phases]: one is “karma” [action] and the other is “gyana” [knowledge/wisdom]. Moving prana from the Muladhar to the Agya, chakra by chakra, according to guru's instructions is indeed the “karmakanda” [phase of action]. And, keeping the attention fixed in Kutastha, taking the mind – together and complete with all of the vrittis [functionalities] of the senses – above the Agya, being established in the Sahasrar, doing “shravana-manana-nididhyasana” [hearing, contemplating, being absorbed] in stillness – meaning: hearing the Pranava Sound, doing contemplation (meditating with the inner vision) on the Light within the Sound, and making hearing, seeing etc. - all of the vrittis – into one melody [or: one tune] and becoming completely absorbed – all of this is the spiritual act of the “buddhi” [faculty of observing and ascertaining] – the “gyanakanda” [phase of knowledge/wisdom]. In this gyanakanda, there are two sections: the performance of the act using buddhi and the [yogic] state of being. These two sections are further divided into groups of twos. The first two divisions [of the first section – the part where the act takes place – in gyanakanda] are: “upasana” [worship; experiencing the glories]. This is a buddhi-oriented state (Chapter 2, sloka 50 [of the Gita]). And then there is the state where there is no knowledge of the hearer and the heard (Chapter 2, sloka 52). These are the two divisions [in the section of the buddhi-oriented act]. The second section - “gyana” [knowledge/wisdom]. In this, there is [first] a state attained through the practice of yoga (Chapter 2, sloka [unclear in print – possibly 53]), and [then] a realized state in yoga (Chapter 2, sloka 71). This section is divided into these two parts. It is at the end of this [progression of] karma-upasana-gyana that Brahman-Nirvana is attained after leaving the body [death] (Chapter 2, sloka 72). All of these are stages that belong to the path of sadhana; therefore they are related and connected to each other. However, when one particular stage is active – that very stage becomes the primary one over the other stages for that time. Thus, when there is karma [act], at that time action is primary. And then, upon passing through the stage of action, when the vritti [functionality] of certainty springs forth during the stage of buddhiyoga and “yoga” [connectedness] is attained, at that time karma [act] is “dureNa avaraṃ” [far away and unseen]. The sum of it is this - as the springing forth from buddhi happens because of the act, the act is the great thing [at that time]. And then again, because it is from buddhi or gyana that the “anamaya pada” (“Peace” or “establishment in Brahman”) is attained, buddhi is seen as “jyayasi” - even greater. After the all-knowing Srigurudev [Sri Krishna] says all of these things, the little-knowing disciple (sadhak) thinks: if buddhi is greater, then what is the need for the act? Right. It would be best to just sit silently with attention fixed in Kutastha and do “shravana-manana-nididhyasana” [hear-contemplate-be absorbed]. What is the need to make such an effort to move prana?! The sadhak did not understand that without the act, the springing forth from buddhi does not happen. And if the act is not there, then the functionality of buddhi also gradually diminishes, and one has to again become wrapped up in outer things. The sadhak concludes that the [yogic] act is just intense distress. Footnote - Just by being a sadhak, one is surely aware of the hardship of asana, pranayama etc. As well, the sadhak must also be aware of the intense bliss that comes forth at the paravastha of Kriya [post-Kriya poise], when one is focused on Kutastha and is absorbed, experiencing the divine things within. When one thinks about that [latter] state, it certainly does seem like the act is just intense distress. Footnote complete.It is for this reason that the sadhak is telling the World-Guru [Sri Krishna], “You are the One Who is “Janardana” (“jan” = emergence; “ardana” = destruction), the Lord of the destruction of past lives, and “Keshava” (“ka” = Creator; “isha” = Destroyer; “va” = Void), the “Kaivalya” (Only-ness) devoid of creation and destruction. Then why are You making me participate in such an intense (terrifying/terrible) act?”"
2,It is as if You are trying to bewilder my intellect with these confusing words. That by which I will attain the great – tell me something about that with clarity and certainty.,"The sadhak (Arjuna), upon learning about the difference between “sankhya buddhi” (gyana-yoga) and “yoga-buddhi” (karma-yoga) – these two – in the previous chapter [Chapter 2], and upon understanding about the establishment in Brahman according to the teachings of Sankhya, had become eager to attain that [establishment in Brahman]. And the sadhak concluded that compared to the establishment in Brahman, the act is an intense distress. But the Lord, through the statement “dharmyaddhi yuddhAcchreyo'nyat kshatriyasya na vidyate” [there is nothing greater for a Kshatriya [warrior] than the opportunity to fight a righteous war] (Chapter 2, sloka 31 [of the Gita]), explained that there is nothing greater for the Kshatriya than the dutiful battle (karma [yogic act]). In this [statement], it is indeed the act that is being praised. And again, by this statement, “durena hyavaraṃ karma buddhiyogat dhananjaya” [action is far inferior to buddhiyoga [yoga of knowledge], Dhananjaya [Arjuna]] (Chapter 2, sloka 49), He is also saying that buddhi [intellect] (gyana [knowledge]) is superior to karma [action]. In this [statement], it is  indeed the intellect that is being praised. Thus, having become desirous to attain the establishment in Brahman through the practice of yoga through intellect, and upon hearing the Lord praise action at one time and the intellect at another time, doubt arrived in the mind of the sadhak; the intellect also became bewildered. Which one is better? Is it better to take recourse in the wisdom of yoga, or is it better to take recourse in the wisdom of Sankhya? The sadhak is not able to become clear and certain about this. That is why the sadhak asks Guru-Brahman Kutastha Who is within, “Amongst karma [act] and buddhi (gyana) which is the best (giver of Liberation)?” The sadhak is desiring that this be clear and certain."
3,"The Lord said, “O Anagha [blameless one; Arjuna]! I have told you previously that there are two types of “nishtha” [steadied abidance in something] on this plane of existence: the “nishtha” of gyana-yoga by those on the side of Sankhya, and the “nishtha” of karma-yoga by those on the side of the yogis.  -3-","The certain steadiness that is full of devotion and reverence, the kind of steady state, which, when it comes about, makes the body motionless, when the antahkarana [aggregate of inner operators of personal consciousness] becomes pointed toward the inner world and goes beyond the bindu, sound and attributes – it is that which is called “nishtha” [steadied abidances]! In the physical world, that nishtha is of two types: one – the Sankhya's – meaning: gyani's – they [attain that nishtha] via gyana-yoga, and those who are yogis – meaning: “karmis” [performers of action] – they attain that nishtha via karma-yoga. In the body, prana is the power of movement, and mind is the power of consciousness. Putting mind in that prana is called “karma-yoga,” and putting mind in mind is called “gyana-yoga.” By applying the instructions of guru, and placing the mantra of the Self together with “hangsa” in a precise way on the six chakras in the path of sushumna is putting the mind on prana. And aiming towards the state of stillness at the Sahasrar, which is above the Agya, via “shravana-manana-nididhyasana” [hearing, contemplating, being absorbed], and going on to ascertain the knowledge of spiritual things is putting mind in mind. The result of the precise offering of mantra is: becoming support-free and merging as one in the Sky of Brahman. And the final result of ascertaining the knowledge of spiritual things is the dissolution of the mind and becoming Still in the Vishnu-ness. These two are verily the same; the difference is only in the way they appear to be. In Chapter 2 [of the Gita], from sloka 20 to sloka 38,  gyana-nishtha [abidance through awareness], and from sloka 40 to sloka 53, karma-nishtha [abidance through the act of yoga] have been explained. That is why the Lord said, “Pura prokta” [taught as a complete whole; alternate translation: taught since ancient times]. Because the sadhak, having received the teachings of Sankhya, is no longer falling into the restlessness of the outer experiences and has become fit to receive the Knowledge of Brahman. That is why he [Arjuna] is being called “anagha” [blameless] – meaning: sinless – in this sloka."
4,A person will not attain non-doingness without having acted. Just by taking sannyas [becoming a renunciate monk] one does not attain Realization. ,"In gyana-nishtha [abidance through awareness], which is the realization of non-doingness or establishment in Brahman, there is the absence of action. Thus there is no disturbance/restlessness. There is the Onlyness, waveless Wholeness. And in action there are the tremendous waves of struggle, where there is nothing but restlessness. If these two are placed next to each other, they do seem antagonistic to each other. But yogis say, “That is not so (they are not antagonistic to each other).” The primary recourse to attain establishment in Brahman is actually karma-yoga [practicing the yogic act], which, if not performed, all of the vrittis [active tendencies] of the antahkarana (which is where action begins) cannot be completely brought to an end – meaning: the state where there is no memory of the vrittis does not come about. If one is not able to bring those [vrittis] to an end – that resting in the realization of non-doingness – the consciousness cannot apprehend that. This is because: the establishment in Brahman, or the realization of non-doing-ness comes about through the previous “doing” of that karma [yogic act]. The end of this act is the attainment of non-doingness, and the union at the end of the act is verily “karma-yoga” [union through the act]. Dear sadhak! See for yourself: when you went on to do the purification of the elements in the brahmanadi in the Muladhar, at that time, because of the colliding dissolutions taking place (the technique is known through the teachings of guru) – how much disturbance/restlessness you had to go through! When you pierced the Agya-chakra and put your attention on the non-doing Guru-ness – it is then that your non-doingness began. Gradually, the more you entered the Guru-ness, the more your restlessness in the Agya-chakra below went on to be farther and farther away. And your non-doingness continued to grow. When you merged with the Guru-ness, that prana-driving karma [duty] that you had, that which you had duly performed before – that completely left you. You got that realization of non-doingness. If you had not done the practice of driving prana in the path of consciousness (in the Space of Brahman), then you would have had to become wrapped up in the five elements of the worldly experience and you would have been drowning and gasping. You would never have been able to enjoy this Still Peace-Happiness. And see even more: before learning about driving prana in the path of sushumna, the masses of latent desires of the outer experiences that are acquired through the natural process of inhalation and exhalation and are imprinted in the chitta [personal consciousness; heart] – if you try to renounce actions (appear as a renunciate monk) while those imprints (meaning: the previously acquired karmas) are still there, then you could not get that realization of the state of gyana-nishtha (the state of rest in Brahman). That is why the Divine Lord said, “If the person does not perform karma [yogic act], then that person does not attain the state of non-doingness. Or – that person cannot attain Perfection by abandoning karma and becoming a purposeless monk either.”"
5,"No one can stay still even for a moment without acting, because the three gunas of Prakriti have everyone/everything under their power and they make a person act.","“Karma” [action] is nothing but the activity of prana. Whether wise or ignorant, all are bound to this movement of prana. Without the pranic activity taking place (“ajapajapa” [sacred repetition happening automatically, i.e. inhalation and exhalation]), absolutely no one can continue to be even for a short while. This activity does not stop even when one is asleep. As well, no one can say “I will not do it” and just be like that. This is because: everyone has fallen into the trap of sattva, rajas, and tamas – these three gunas [universal operative qualities] – and being under their power, everyone has to do “karma” [act]. In sattva-guna, the breath moves in the sushumna, and in rajas and tamas, the breath moves in ida and pingala. For as long as there will be the activity of the three gunas, for that long will the breath also move about in these [aforementioned] ways. Without being wrapped up in the Brahman-mantra and doing prana-Kriya according to the instructions of guru and going beyond the three gunas, the renunciation of karma does not happen. Therefore, the real sannyas [true renunciation] also does not happen."
6,"The person who, after controlling the senses, goes on thinking about the matters of the world – that person is known as a “mudhatma” [stupid being] and a “kapatachari” [hypocrite].","The person who acts like a renunciate without having crossed the field of actions through performance of the [spiritual] act – even if that person has controlled the organs of action, because of being tied to the gunas of Prakriti, that person's mind has to go to the matters of the world. Then, in order to show people one's “renunciated-ness,” one keeps the organs of action from working. This kind of victory over the sense-organs can only get one the pleasure of “loka-ananda” [joy from people's approval]; one cannot get “Brahmananda” [the Bliss of Brahman]. “Stupid”: because – although the force of being caught up in the worldly experience is taking over the mind, it is only to keep the asserted reputation [of holiness] intact that this person controls the sense-organs. That is why this person is a “mithyachari” [cultivator of the false]. Footnote - Just by being a sadhak, one knows this: one has been sitting in the correct posture during Kriya; Kriya is going on; while continuing, such a thought about worldly matters rises up in the mind that one perhaps ends Kriya for that day due to that thought. This is also a state of “mithyachar” [cultivation of the false]. When this condition comes about, one must go on doing Kriya with steady persistence, following the teaching “tatastato niyamyaitadAtmanyeva vashaṃ nayet” [rein in [the mind] from that [worldly thought] and let it be under the control of the Self]; one can then become released [from being bound]. End Footnote."
7,O Arjuna! But the one who controls all of the sense-organs along with the mind and begins karma-yoga by using the organs of action – it is that “asakta” (without attachment; non-addicted) person who is worthy – meaning: one who becomes “yukta” [connected/united].,"Sitting cross-legged, putting the heel of one foot at the anus, and the heel of the other foot at the root of the sex organ. Start Footnote. One can also do sadhana comfortably in “swastikasana” [description follows]. Upon sitting cross-legged, there are creases where the two thighs and the two knees fold [the creases formed by the folding of the lower legs against the thighs]. Putting the two feet in those two creases, and being locked in a triangle-like posture, and sitting easily with the back, head and neck aligned is “swastikasana.” End Footnote. making the arms/hands straight on top of the knees which are aligned according to the posture, keeping the wrists [there], making the spinal column, neck and head straight and aligned, putting attention on Kutastha and keeping the organs of perception mentally fixed on whatever is happening there [at Kutastha], and then beginning the “karma” [act] by moving prana according to the instructions of guru – one can, after some time, become “yukta” [connected/united]. Later, remaining seated in the same way, by using the fingers of both hands and closing the doors of the eyes, ears, nose and mouth according to the instructions of guru, “paramaṃ puruShaṃ divyaṃ yAti” - meaning: the Supreme Person is witnessed – the One Who is spoken about and described as “Hiranmaya Purush” [Golden Person; Radiant Person] in the Upanishads. Start Footnote. See Chandogya Upanishad – Discourse 1, Section 6, sloka 6:“yatha yadavaitadAdityasya shuklaṃ bhAh saiva sA, atha yanneelaṃ paraṃ kṛShNaṃ tadam tatsAma, atha yah eyo'ntarAditye niraNmayah puruSho dṛshyate hiraNyashmashrurhiraNyakesha ApraNasvAtsarva eva suvarNah” Bengali translation [of the above sloka from the Chandogya Upanishad] - And this, whatever is the bright “bhah” (radiance) of the Sun, that is “sa,” and that supremely blue [deep blue] dark radiance – that is verily “ama.” That (the coupled radiance of the bright and dark radiance) is known as “Sama.” And there, that Being, Who is seen as the “Hiranmaya Purush” [Golden Person; Radiant Person] within that Sun – that Person has a golden beard and golden hair. Everything is golden, radiating from that Person's golden nails (resplendent with Light). End Footnote. That Person is verily the Supreme Destination. One who, via pranayam, has purified the heart, has become unattached, and by using the organs of action has closed the nine doors, and has become focused and dedicated in this sadhana of the Spiritual Supreme Person (does the performance of [yogic] karma-yoga) – it is that person who is “connected/united”; it is that person who is, indeed, eminent."
8,"Perform the karma [act] with “niyata” [steadfastness], because “karma” [action] is greater than “akarma” [lack of action]. What is even more: without doing karma, you cannot even maintain your body.","Pretending to be a renunciate without being a “karmi” [one who performs action] (meaning: yogi) – if one stays in the state of the “akarma” [the lack of action] that comes about from that – because of all of the senses being tied to the world-oriented fruits of previously accumulated karma, the Supreme Thing cannot be attained. But if one does karma [yogic act] according to the teachings of guru, the inevitable result of that [act] is that karma [accumulation of results] is destroyed, and the “akarma” [non-doing] that comes about because of that – it is that very state that makes one attain the Supreme Thing. That is why doing karma [performing yogic action] is superior to the “akarma” [refraining from acting] of the “made-up renunciate.” “Karma” - the coming and going of prana within and without – is happening in each body. By abandoning that, no one at all can keep the body alive. By nature, everyone is forced to do this. When a technique is applied to that natural karma [act of prana movement], a supernatural, Eternal, Blissful Glory comes forth. That is why Srigurudev [Sri Krishna] has instructed that one has to perform karma [yogic act] with “niyata” [steadfastness]. Being steadfastly determined and disciplined according to instructions, moving prana in the direction of the Self – meaning: when one applies a technique to the naturally happening karma [prana moving in and out], one is doing “niyataṃ” [steadfast] karma"
9,"Doing action other than those that are for “yagya” [oblation; offering into fire], one has to become bound to the bindings of karma on this plane [of existence]. Therefore, Kaunteya [Arjuna]! Be unattached, and perform action as “yagya.”  -9-","“Yagya” - meaning: “homa” [oblation; offering into fire] – meaning: throwing ghee [clarified butter] into ceremonial fire while chanting mantras with “uddesha” [intent] towards the “devas” [gods]. Vishnu is the One Who is the true “Deva” [God]. The Lord Himself has said, “ahamAdihirdevAnaṃ” [I am even prior to the gods]. It is from Him that “pravṛttih prasṛtA purANee” [all has come forth from the beginning]. It is He Who is the Kutastha Purush. “Ut” - “urdhadesha” [the upper area] – meaning: being focused on Kutastha is “uddesha” [intent]. Keeping attention on Kutastha, giving the oblation of prana in every chakra according to the instructed injunctions of guru (this is called “prana-yagya”; it is also called “antarayaga”), when the mind becomes enraptured by the resonance of the buzzing of bees, then the elixir (“amrita” [nectar]) drips from the Sahasrar. That elixir has to be thrown to the “vaishvanara” [fire in the navel area] via the upwardly turned tongue, according to the method instructed by guru; that is, indeed, “yagya!” This does not happen without “deva-uddeshya” [intent on the Divine]. And it is with this that the Lord of yagyas – Vishnu – becomes pleased. - Start Footnote - One who can give oblation to the “jatharagni” [digestive fire] which is known by the name “Sudha Vaishvanara” [elixir of the universal being; elixir and fire in the navel region], that oblation pervades throughout all of the nadis [subtle energy pathways], nourishing and awakening all of the powers (the beings that reside on each of the petals of the lotuses). Because of this the body becomes radiant; light shines forth [from the body]. This body is verily the temple of Vishnu, where Brahman-God Hari presides. - End Footnote. -   The type of “karma” [yogic act] – the type of pranic movement (to learn which is the very reason for following guru) that pleases the Lord of yagyas – that is what is known as “tadarthaṃ karma” [the meaningful act]. Doing any other act besides that “tadartha” [meaningful] act (meaning: not offering prana in every lotus while keeping the mind steadily on Kutastha – meaning: when the mind does not become fully merged in prana) one absolutely will fall into the “bandhan” [bindings] of the Prakritic karma of the world.- Start Footnote. - “Bandhan” [bindings]: the karma whose fruits have to be experienced – that is “bandhan.” That “bandhan” is indeed the covering of Prakriti. That covering is differentiated into many types such as physical, subtle [and such]. The physical body is a “bandhan.” One cannot leave the recourse of the physical condition and abide in the sky. Due to being under the power of gravity, one has to fall to the ground. The subtle body is another “bandhan.” Now this one has different kinds of heavier and lighter types [of bindings] according to the different karma-samskaras [impressed tendencies which become active]. With this [subtle] body, one can leave the earthly plane and go into the path of air, but one cannot cross past the sphere of air. One has to go around in the levels or planes [of existence] according to the samskaras [impressed tendencies]. One cannot go the level of the pure sphere of space which is above that [sphere of air]. After ordinary death occurs, the non-liberated spirits stay in this sphere of air in many ways/forms. Later, due to the ascribed time of abiding there coming to an end, and because of the fruits of previous actions, they return to samsara. For as long as the karmas are not eliminated, for that long does one have to suffer this “bandhan”-affliction of coming and going. Through sadhana, the beneficent samskaras grow and that brings about the end of karmas, and one becomes free of “bandhan” [bindings] and becomes Liberated. “Yadi dehaṃ pṛthakkṛtya chiti vishrAmya tiShThasi; adhunaiva sukheeshAntah bandhamukto bhaviShyasi” [if you separate your consciousness from the body and rest in Awareness, you will even now/at once be happy and peaceful, free from bondage] – Ashtavakra Saṃhita, First Section. - End Footnote. - It is for this reason that one has to let go of attachment (because attachment is the very reason for being bound to karma) and perform the “tadartha” [meaningful] act. This is the teaching that is given."
10,"At the beginning of creation, Prajapati [a deity – lord of creatures/lord of subjects] created the subjects [created beings] with yagya and said, “May you, step by step, attain the heights of the Self. Let this bring about the bestowing of the beneficent fruits.”","During the time when the [sperm] from the body of the father travels into the womb of the mother, the prana of the father spreads [in the womb]. With the mixing together of that prana with the prana of the mother, the prana-flow [for the new body] begins. At this time, in the form of a particle subtler than all particles (as small as that) in the microcosm of the body, the seven heavens are formed. In those seven abodes, Mahamaya (“Jagaddhatri” [Goddess Who is the foundation of the world) appearing in the form of Life, activates the supernatural powers that are ascribed to the seven abodes through Her Power. Because of this the seven elements expand; by which, the sheath of the body continues to grow. This is why the creature is [said to be] “with yagya.” There are two “Prajapati[s]” [see the Bengali translation section above] [as the title] pertains to human existence. The first is the giver of the first birth, and another is the giver of the second birth. The giver of the first birth are parents. The giver of the second birth is guru. Both of these two declare: “anena prasaviShyadhvam” [by this, may you bring forth; see sloka 10 above for the Sanskrit occurrence] etc. Because the parents' “declaring” is within the “Adi icchAshakti” [power of primal desire], it [the declaring] remains unrevealed. Because the guru's “declaring” is within teachings, it [the declaring] is revealed. Srigurudev gives the disciple the right to enter the inner world from outside and gives [the disciple] the second birth. At that time, upon showing the disciple the “sahaj” [easy/simple/natural] yagya of prana and showing the disciple the method of applying the technique, He says, “It is by this that there is attainment of the heights. It is by this that the beneficent fruits are had.”"
11,"Through this yagya, may you nourish the gods. May the gods nourish you. Through this mutual nourishing of each other, you will attain the supreme beneficence.","In the path of sadhana – Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, Surya and Ganapati – these five gods are worshipped. These five are the residing places of all gods, gandharvas, kinnaras [celestial beings] and such. Just by being a sadhak, one is the worshipper of these five. The reason is: in Bhurloka – at the Muladhar as Ganapati, in Bhuvarloka – at the Svadhisthan as Shakti, in Svarloka – at the Manipur as Surya, in Maharloka – at the Anahata as Vishnu, in Janaloka – at the Vishuddha as Shiva – One Brahman as these five for the beneficence of the sadhak. These five are “kshara brahman” [impermanent/destructible reality]. After the elements are purified through the worship of these “kshara” [impermanent divinities], the worship of Akshara Brahman [Permanent/Indestructible Reality] Kutastha Purush takes place in the Tapoloka – at the Agya. After that, there is Satyaloka, where, by knowing the Supreme Person at the Sahasrar and becoming the knower of all, one becomes That which is beyond Sat and asat.Through this yagya [spiritual act] one has to nourish those gods – meaning: awaken them through oblation. When the gods awaken, they make the jiva nourished – meaning: fill the jiva with the essential knowledge of the elements. Through this mutual nourishing of one another, the Supreme Greatness that is the Supreme Destiny – meaning: the Destiny to the Self or Liberation – that can be had. Upon having taken recourse in the brahmanadi, while keeping sight locked in Kutastha, one has to do purak-rechak [yogic inhalation-exhalation, respectively] while mentally uttering the mantra of the Self together with prana and going on striking and striking at each lotus. Right upon striking in one location [lotus], staying in the natural course and not trying to have doership over the movement of prana in any way, one has to go beyond that location [that one has just struck]. One must not have even the slightest engagement of desire whatsoever in any of the locations. Start Footnote --  It is the appearance of desire that creates obstacles. Either there is a fall, or one gets stuck there. Progress does not happen. -- End Footnote. Going on doing purak-rechak [see beginning of paragraph] in this way, [this happens:] just as when the vital-air enters the many nadis [subtle pathways], it makes them activated, in the same way, the vaishvanara [fire in the navel area], takes the flow of the elixir falling from the Sahasrar and turns it back upward, goes into the nerves in the spinal column and nourishes and energizes them. And because of that striking taking place at each lotus, the vital-air of space churns and vibrates (just like in chemistry), bringing forth the powers of each of those locations [lotuses]. And the abodes (each of those lotuses with their ruling goddesses) become flooded with beautiful light. This is that which is called “nourishing the gods.” As the darkness disappears from the heart because of that light, the sadhak's “bhoot” [past] (that which has happened) and “bhavishyat” [future] (that which will happen) become visible and go on being seen. And the knowledge of earth, water and such [the elements] is born. This is the nourishing of the creatures or the jiva by the gods. As this nourishing activity goes on happening, the intense light of consciousness of the fully nourished and awakened powers and the jiva's (sadhak's) full knowledge of the elements become one at the end. Then there is the Supreme Realization of Self-Knowledge - “chidanandarupah shivohaṃ” [I am the Consciousness-Bliss Shiva/Blessedness]."
12,"When the gods are nourished via yagya [rite], they will bestow beneficent enjoyment on you. One who partakes of their offerings without giving to them – that one is certainly a thief.","“Bhaavan” [nourishing; intaking] is of two types: one is ordinary, that which takes place in a non-sadhana state in all bodies, and the other is methodic, that which happens via sadhana. The statement in the sloka above [3:12] is speaking about this methodic “bhaavan.” Every jiva experiences the fruits of karma. The gods that are established in the abode of the heart are the lords of those karmic fruits. The natural activities of exhalation and inhalation and such – they are actually bound to a supernatural law operated by the gods. Thus, whether the jiva takes up the method or remains under the power of natural activities, because the bodily activities get carried out whether one is willing or unwilling, the nourishing of the gods takes place unknowingly. But that which happens without wanting it to happen because of the jiva being under the powers of natural activities – one cannot get the pure beneficence that is to be enjoyed by that process. -- Start Footnote -- All of the supernatural powers that are attained as a result of sadhana – they are not the pure beneficence that is to be enjoyed. This is because they are impermanent, and if one partakes in them, one has to become tied up in samsara. The Substance that is received, upon not holding on to any of those powers and going beyond the right to experience worldly things – That is verily the pure beneficence that is to be enjoyed. One does not ever have to live separated from That. -- End Footnote. -- This is because due to lack, discontentedness remains. It is to get rid of this discontentedness due to lack that one has to willfully take up the method. When the method is taken up, the giving of the heart and soul and the essence of the body (elixir) takes place with the [act of] offering of prana to each lotus. Because of that, the pure beneficence that is to be enjoyed – the Bliss of Brahman – one gets that very thing. The one who does not take up the method – that one's heart and soul and the elixir within the body become directed towards the worldly experiences – because of oneself being under the power of one's own nature, and thus become eroded moment by moment through the experience of physical pleasures. And this does not nourish the gods. In actuality, the activities of the body are operated and run by the gods such as “vaishvanara” [fire in the navel region] and such, and the currents of prana as well as the elixir are bestowed by them, verily. Thus, all of these [constituents] are their things/property. Therefore, not offering all of those things to the gods via the method, and spending [it all] through the pleasures of the body and the enjoyments of the world is truly being a thief. The sadhana of goodness does not happen in that way."
13,The sadhus [practitioners] become free of all sins by eating the food of the yagya. But those who commit sin for themselves – those persons of sinful character eat only sin.,"Yagya [rite with oblations into fire] is actually pranayam. The stilling of pranas is the end of the yagya. The one who eats of this final part – meaning: the one who stills the prana vital airs and holds them (kumbhak [retention]) in the body – that is the person who is the eater of the food at the end of the yagya. Those who – by stopping prana through that type of kumbhak – are the eaters of the food at the end of the yagya, and are “santa” [saint] (those who – by entering the True Substance with a one-pointed mind – become enraptured) – they are verily the ones who go beyond the restlessness of Prakriti and become Free. Start Footnote -- See the commentary on Chapter 2, sloka 44. Without being a sadhu [practitioner] and just being a partaker at the end of the yagya (showman yogi) does not bring about the firmness of the intellect; therefore, Liberation does not happen. -- End Footnote. But those, who – because of selfish reasons – meaning: those who – succumbing to desire because of wanting to enjoy worldly pleasures – take in (eat) food, water, air and such into the stomach, only “agha” (only the restlessness of mind) takes place in their bodies. Stillness does not come."
"14,15","All of the “bhoota[s]” [elements] emerge from “anna” [food]. “Annasambhava” (the birth of food) happens due to “parjanya” (rain). “Parjanya” emerges from yagya. Yagya emerges from karma [act]. Karma emerges from Brahman, and Brahman emerges from  “Akshara” [the Indestructible]. Thus, Brahman, Who is within all, is present in every yagya.","That which is above the “kshara” [destructible] – that is “Akshara” [the Indestructible] – meaning: “Parabrahman” [Supreme Absolute], Kutastha, “Avyakta” [the Inexpressible], within which, and from which, the manifested universe (“kshara” [the destructible]) exists. The place from which one witnesses this is the Agyana-chakra. -- Start Footnote. --  It is in this Agyana-chakra that “ekasthaṃ sacharAcharaṃ kṛtsnaṃ jagat” [the cosmic manifestation of the moving and non-moving is situated in One] is revealed. That is why Srigurudev gives the “agya” [directive] to steady the attention in this place. For this reason the Agyana-chakra is called the “Agya-chakra.” -- End Footnote. -- It is from this “Akshara” that Brahman emerges – that which is called “Veda,” “Shabda-Brahman” [Brahman as sound] or “Pranava” - meaning: the space-element or “vyoma” [ether]. Its [Shabda Brahman's] place is the Vishuddha-chakra. It is from the Shabda-Brahman that “karya-brahman” [Brahman as activity] (prana – meaning: the substance of life) emerges. Prana is itself karma [action] – the one who is called “Mahamaya” in the form of karma [activity]. It is by Her existence that the operation of the  universe-samsara is happening. Her abode is the Anahata-chakra. It is from that activity in the form of prana that makes “yagya” - meaning: the Kriya of “releasing the hold.” Only via the assistance of fire is it possible to release the hold of samsara. Attraction and repulsion etc. takes place [via fire]. For this reason fire is itself the yagya. Its abode is the Manipur-chakra. From the yagya of fire in the form of Kriya, the liquid element emerges, that which is always immersed. Thus it has the name “parjanya”  [rain; rain-god]. Its abode is the Svadhisthan-chakra. The earth-element is created from the liquid/water-element. This earth [element] is itself “anna” [food], because it is the only “adhar” [foundation]. That is why its name is also “Muladhar” [the root foundation], and its abode is also the Muladhar-chakra. It is from the Muladhar in the form of food that “bhoota[s]” (that which goes) - meaning: living beings – emerge. It is when prana enters the covering of the earthen form that a living being is created. That is why it has been stated [in the sloka above] that “bhoota[s]” are born from food. Now – this which has just been said – the process of creation, -- Start Footnote. -- In the original sloka, in order to show the progression of nivritti [spiritual undoing; spiritual withdrawal] in the path of sadhana, the progression has shown as beginning at activity and ending in causality. However, in the commentary, in order to make it easier to understand, the process of creation starting with causality and its progressive spread of activity is shown. -- End Footnote. from the Akshara to bhoota – although all of these are born from the One, because of mutations, they are different and separate in quality from each other. But even within these [aspects of creation] there is a common thing that is prevalent [in all of them]. That is the Shabda-Brahman or Pranava [Divine Sound]. The sound from the space-element is in air, fire, water, earth – it is in all of them, but the sense of touch in the air-element, the sense of sight in the fire-element, the sense of taste in the water-element, and the sense of smell in the earth-element are not present in the ether-element [or: space-element]. On the other hand, it is with the support of the sound of the ether/space-element, or the Shabda-Brahman, that “Akshara” [the Indestructible] and the “Uttama Gati” [the Highest Destination] are attained. “Dhvanirantargataṃ jyoti jyotirantargataṃ manah tanmano vilayaṃ yAti tadviShNoh paramaṃ padam” [within the resonance is the light; within the light is the mind; where that mind is dissolved, that is the Supreme Vishnu-state] – Uttara Gita, Chapter 1, sloka 40.12 Therefore, this Brahman in the form of Sound is within all. And it is ever-present in yagya. This is because: the flow of air that is going on due to the presence of fire at the Manipur, the strikes from that [air] are causing sound[s] to resonate in everything and all the time, proportionately more or less, like a process similar to sound coming forth because of air going into a cone. This is going on ceaselessly. Because the mind stays outside [in the outer world], it is not possible to hear those sounds. But if the mind is taken within, the more one-pointedness there is, the more all of those sounds become clearer and clearer; they can be heard quite well. Ordinarily, if one presses and closes the openings of the ears, a tumultuous sound can be heard; that the common people's proverbial “sound of the fire burning Ravana [defeated demon-king in the Ramayana].” Actually, that sound is really the conglomeration of all of those prana-struck sounds [alternate translation: prana explosions]. When that sound is in the unmixed state [or: state without pranic collisions], that is Pranava. Because this Pranava has no ceasing, it is called “nitya” [endless]. If one takes the mind within, via the yagya of doing pranayam and such on every chakra, then one finds recourse in Brahman in the form of this Pranava, and experiences the witnessing of “Akshara” or “Parabrahman” in the form of Light at the Kutastha. Later, when the mind dissolves in that Light, one attains Stillness at the abode of the Sahasrar. That is the “Parampad” [Supreme Substance; Supreme Abode] or the “Uttam Gati” [Highest Destination.] Thus, the only way to attain that Supreme Substance is yagya [yogic act]. Therefore, yagya or karma [yogic act] is needful work. In these two slokas, if one observes the subjects of the creation and functionality in the six sections of text starting from “annadbhavanti” [existence happening from food] to “samudbhavam” [emerging with] [the text of the above two slokas from the beginning of sloka 3:14 to the end of the first line of sloka 3:15], it can be seen that the direction of the first three sections of text is from causality to activity, and the direction of latter three sections of text is from activity to causality. The central junction point of these different stages is the fire-element residing in the Manipur. The intention of explaining it in this way is this: for as long as the sadhak does not go past the Manipur [in an upward direction], for that long will he/she have to fall to the activity in the lower direction because of the pull of the “vaishayik tamo” [world-directed tamas]. As soon as the sadhak goes past the Manipur [upwards], then immediately – due to the pull of “avaishayik tamo” [non-world-directed tamas] – the sadhak continues to move upwards in the direction of causality. The reason is this: on the bottom side of the Manipur, because the rajoguna [in that region] is of a greater amount, there is restlessness which causes the activities to go on taking place; and on the top side [of the Manipur], because the sattva guna [in that region] is of a greater amount, there is a lack of restlessness which cause the activities to cease and the root causality goes on being revealed. Comparing the greater or lesser proportions of rajas against the proportions of sattva, the second section of the field in the form of the body - “dharmashetra-kurukshetra” [see Chapter 1, sloka 1 of the Gita] - meaning: the path of sadhana – can also be divided into two sections [within this area]. This is because: from the Muladhar to the Manipur, the rajoguna – meaning: restleness (karma [action]) – is proportionately more, and that is why it is called “kurukshetra” (karmakshetra [field of activity]); and because sattva guna – meaning: the tranquil light (dharma [spirituality]) – is proportionately more from the Manipur to the Agya, this region is called “dharmakshetra” [field of spirituality]. That is why: because of the primacy of karma below the Manipur, there is the going on of activities, and because of the primacy of dharma above the Manipur, it is seen that the activities dissolve into the root causality."
16,"O Partha [Arjuna]! One who does not do “anuvartan” [reversal of direction/cycle] of the chakras as they are manifested here in this way is “aghayu” [of short lifespan], “indriyaram” [delights in the senses] and lives a meaningless/useless/failed life.","Now, these chakras that have manifested: first – Agya. Start Footnote. -- The Sahasrar is a field devoid of rajas [guna]. There is no activity in that place. There is only the Still Revelatory Light. At the start of creation – it is at the Agya that rajas first appears. That is why Agya is [mentioned as] the first [instead of second]. -- End Footnote.  second – Vishuddha, third – Anahata, fourth – Manipur, fifth – Svadhisthan and sixth – Muladhar – each of these have emerged from the one previous to it. Similarly, Consciousness has also come down, one by one, and at the very end, has taken on the garb of “bhoota” [living beings] upon coming to the Muladhar and coming out [to the external world]. In order for It to again reach/return to the True Substance, It has to take the very same road on which It came down – meaning: It has to first enter the Muladhar, go from there to the Svadhisthan, then from the Svadhisthan to the Manipur – in this way, It has to go to the Agya. This reversal of direction is called “anuvartan.” The one who does not do this “anuvartan,” that person is “aghayu” [of short lifespan] – meaning: that person's lifespan diminishes because of staying in the worldly experience with its torrents of restlessness. That person does not find rest and peace. That person is “indriyaram” [delights in the senses] – meaning: the impermanent delight that comes from sensory events – he/she experiences only that. Not having the Pristine Bliss of the Self, that person cannot become “Atma-Rama” [Delighter in the Self]. And that person is “moghaṃ jeevati” - meaning: carries on a meaningless/useless/failed life. This is because the worldly experience is impermanent. For this reason, whatever that person takes up, that very thing ends. Thus, after one [desired thing] ends, another one is taken up; after that ends, another one – in this way, that person has to run from one worldly experience to the ends of worldly experiences; he/she cannot find the Indestructible Bliss. Thus, that person stays in a contemptible life."
17,"But the person who is absorbed in the Self, and is satisfied in the Self alone, and finds contentment in only the Self – no “karya” [work/activity] remains for that person.","What is “karya” [work/activity]? When mind, together with the senses, goes to the worldly experiences – the kind of pranic flow that happens at that time – that is “karya” [work/activity]. And when mind leaves the worldly experience and goes towards the Self – the kind of pranic movement that flows at that time – this is “karma” [act]. The one who is “Atma-Rama” [Delighter in the Self] – meaning: the one who, being enraptured in the Knowledge of the Self, sees the entire creation as being filled with the Self, because of that person not having awareness of the worldly experience, he/she has no “karya” [work/activity]. And the word “tu” says that because that person has no awareness of differences, he/she has no need to do “anuvartan” [see sloka 3:16] of the chakras either.  — Begin Footnote. —  See Chapter 2, sloka 46. The “vijanata brahmin” [one who is based in Brahman, and master of gyana and vigyana] is the one who is “Atmarati” [absorbed in the Self], “Atmatṛpta” [satisfied in the Self] and “Atmani santuShTa” [content in the Self]. — End Footnote."
18,"That sadhak has no need of performing actions in this world; it also does not matter even if he/she does not do anything. In the earthly matters such as sound, touch etc. (even if that sadhak is in them) – that sadhak does not have to experience any types of consequences of sin or virtue [from being in sensory experiences].","The one who is “Atma-Rama” [Delighter in the Self] - that person has no need of karma [acting] or akarma [not acting] in this world. The sadhak does karma [act] in order to have “naishkarma” [state of non-doing]. And the “naishkarma” state is necessary to attain the destination of the Self. But for the Atma-Rama person, the entire creation is filled with the Self. Thus, for that being, karma and akarma are both one and the same. All is One. Because of Completeness, there is no lack; that sadhak has no need[s]. Even if that sadhak goes around in the five elements, he/she does not have to be wrapped up in good and bad fruits. This is because that sadhak's chitta [heart] has become completely pure in the Light of the Self and is filled with the Self, and because of this, that person is like properly churned butter in water, after the buttermilk has been churned out; even while being in the world, that sadhak never becomes blended with the world. It remains pure."
19,"For that reason (meaning: in order to become Atma-Rama), be unaddicted/unattached and continue doing “karya” [works] and “karma” [rites; acts], because by doing acts while being non-attached (“anaasakta”), the person attains the Supreme Thing.","The ultimate spiritual goal is to become Atma-Rama. In order to be Atma-Rama, the sadhak has to do “karya” [works] and “karma” [yogic acts] in an unattached way. — Begin Footnote. — In sloka 17 [of Chapter 3], “karya” and “karma” have been stated. “Karya” [work] is of the outer; “karma” [act] is of the inner. Karya is physical/material. Karma is subtle. The aim of karya is the worldly experience. The aim of karma is the Self. This is the difference. In the case of the sadhak, the body is properly cultivated via karya – like: sattvic diet, sattvic behavior, cleanliness of body and character etc. The cultivation of the chitta [heart; personal consciousness] is done via karma – like: detachment from the worldly experience, the love for the Self, etc. — End Footnote. — This is because non-attachment is the only way to get Release. It is by doing the non-attached karma [yogic act] that Liberation is attained. — Begin Footnote. —  It can come to the sadhak's mind that: if the teaching is about renouncing attachments/addictions, then why should there even be a desire to be Atma-Rama? That is also an attachment. The answer to this has been given by Srigurudev [God] through the mouth of Ashtavakra [a saint]: “muktimicchati chettAta viShayAn viShavattyaja; kshmArjavadyAtoShasataṃ peeyooShavadbhaja” (Ashtavakra Samhita, Chapter 1, sloka 2); meaning: “if you want Liberation my dear, then abandon “vishaya” [worldly experience] as you would shun “visha” [poison], and endeavor to have forgiveness, sincerity, mercy, contentment and truth.” When one discards the attachment of pravritti [being outer-directed] and desires to have nivritti [withdrawing from the outer], in the end [of this process] all attachment/desire ends and one attains Liberation. But if one is attached/desirous in the direction of pravritti, the attachments do not diminish. They actually grow. Sadhana is also like the principle of “kantakenaiva kantakaṃ” [getting rid of thorns with a thorn] – ending karma [actions and their fruits] through karma [spiritual act]. — End Footnote. —"
20,"Janaka [a saint-king who was the father of Sita, the pure wife of Lord Rama] and such beings attained perfection via karma [action] itself. You should perform action while keeping your sight on the gathering of the “lokas” [planes of existence; or: people].  -20-","The one who gives “janma” [birth] is the one who is “Janaka.” And the one who drives the plough of pranayam and such, digging into the field of the body, and eventually attains the fruit of the pure consciousness of Sita [wife of Lord Rama] – that person is also “Janaka” - meaning: the yogi in union. The meaning of “janakAdayah” [Janaka and such; see sloka 3:20 above] is: the sadhaks of the past – those who attained the pure consciousness – it is through karma [yogic act] that they attained perfection – meaning: establishment in Brahman. That is why karma [yogic act] is imperative. How is that karma to be performed? That is why Srigurudev [Sri Krishna] is saying that - “loka” - meaning: the gathering of everything in the seven planes from the Bhuloka [earth plane] to the Satyaloka [plane of Truth] – meaning: that by which the Bhuloka, located in the Muladhar, gathers itself and merges with Bhuvarloka at the Svadhisthan, then Bhuvah gathers itself and [merges with] Svarloka at the Manipur, Svah into Maharloka at the Anahata, Mahah into the Janaloka at the Vishuddha, Janah into the Tapoloka at the Agya, and Tapah into the Satyaloka at the Sahasrar – continuously going on merging in Layayoga [yoga of merging] in this way – it all ends at the One and Only True Brahman. One has to keep one's sight in that direction and do karma [yogic act] with great care. — Begin Footnote. —  Only by pranayam is the attention steadied enough to be able to “gather” the lokas [planes] in that way. (See the forthcoming sloka 25 [of Chapter 3].) The ways of keeping attention and performing Kriya – the first stages of that has to be learned from guru's teachings; later, through Kriyayoga, one gets to gradually know all, through one's own personal experience. — End Footnote."
21,"The kinds of behavior that a great one exhibits – the ordinary beings also follow their ways. Whatever is proved by that great one, the ordinary people take that up as the correct thing.","(It will not do at all to keep even a scintilla of desire in the mind/heart. One has to become completely unattached/unaddicted. If that is so, then how is it possible to bring the lokas [planes] together by keeping a steady attention and doing karma [yogic act] without engaging in any desire? The answer to the question that has risen through this type deduction is that which is being answered in this sloka.) That which takes birth – that is “jana” [being; person; see end of first line of sloka 3:21 above]. Thus, the senses and all of the vrittis [functionalities] of the senses are all “jana.” Among the janas, the highest in the hierarchy is the mind. Whatever the mind decides upon, or in whichever direction it goes, all of the vrittis of the senses do exactly that and go in that direction as well. — Begin Footnote. — Everyone knows that when mind goes to the worldly desires, in order to experience those worldly desires the senses immediately become energized. If fear, sorrow or such [negative] things come to the mind, the senses also become weakened. If mind remains absorbed in the contemplation of the Truth, the senses also remain in an unperturbed state. Moreover, the states of the mind are not the same every day. It can be observed that the thing that is perceived as very endearing and very satisfying today, and can be enjoyed by the senses, tomorrow that very same thing, because of a change in the mind, is no longer appealing to the senses. From this, it can be understood that all vrittis [functionalities] of the senses follow the mind. — End Footnote. — Therefore, if the mind can be taken up progressively from the Muladhar to the Sahasrar and then merged into the Self, then the vrittis from the lower levels will also withdraw, together with the elements, and along with the union of the mind with the Self, they too [the vrittis and the elements], by falling into the Substance of the Self, will become filled with the Self, or become filled with Brahman. This is a natural law. It happens automatically. No effort is necessary. The only effort to be made is that one must do prana-Kriya while being devoid of any attachment – only this."
22,O Partha [Arjuna]! In the three worlds I have nothing that is “kartavya” [that I must do]. There is nothing I should get nor anything I should not get. I am just in the action here; that is all.," “Bhuh,” “Bhuvah,” “Svah” [physical, subtle, causal – respectively] - these three words represent the whole universe. This Prakritic creation is actually from One Self; thus all of this is filled with the Self – One. For this reason, there is no “kartavya” [obligatory act], nothing to be attained or nothing not to attain. That action, by not doingwhich one causes harm to oneself – what to say, [by not doing which] one cannot even [physically] exist – that is “kartavya” [must do; obligatory act]. For example: if one does not give oblations [food] to “vaishvanara” [fire in the navel area] (in the stomach) every day, there can be no life; therefore that is an obligatory act for the human being. There are many such kinds of Prakritic [worldly] and “adhyatmic” [spiritual] obligatory acts, without doing which, one simply cannot exist. In regards to the Paramatman [Supreme Self], no such kinds of obligatory actions exist. It is not even possible for them to exist [in the case of the Supreme Self]. This is because: the universe that is “Atmavinirgataṃ” [existing within the Self], which exists only because the Self exists, whose existence does not make the Self be existent – how can there be obligatory actions for the Self in this kind of universe? The jiva's recourse/support is food; food's recourse/support is not the jiva. If one examines the aspect of recourse/support and the one who takes recourse/support, it can be seen that the recourse of the body is prana; the recourse of the prana is the mind; the recourse of the mind is jivatman [individual self]; and the recourse of the jivatma is Paramatman [Supreme Self] – it is He Who is the Supreme Person – Brahman-Consciousness/Spirit – “I”. This “I” that is the Supreme Self, the One Who is the recourse/home of all, for Whom no thing is a recourse – that “I” has no “kartavya” [obligatory acts]. And because there is no existence of things separate from the Supreme, there is nothing that is “aprapta” [something not to be had], nor there is any separate “praptavya” [something to be had] in the worldly things; there is no division of time such as past and future, etc. That Being is present only as an actor. In the flow of karma [actions], the jiva has the divisions of time such as past, future etc. The Supreme Self does not have this. This is because the jiva knows little, and therefore sees only the divisions of time. Because the Self is Omniscient and Omnipresent, it is in the present in every place and every way. — Begin Footnote. — It can be illustrated somewhat through this explanation. Like this: land, water, air, clouds – inside and outside all of these there is space. It is within this space that water is present in circuitous flows and in different forms. For example: the water from oceans, rivers and from other bodies of water goes underground, and wetting the nether areas of the Earth, comes up again in the form of springs/fountains. And again, becoming vapor and taking recourse in the sphere of air, the water takes the form of clouds up above, and then descends in the form of rain and returns to the land, oceans, rivers and such. This endless flow is going on and on, unceasingly. If one observes a drop of water, it can be seen that it is not still, but restless. When the drop of water comes from the river and become “present” in the ocean, then it is “past” in the river. When it leaves the ocean upon becoming vapor and becomes “present” in the air, then it has no existence in the ocean. It becomes “past” [in the ocean]. Finally, when it falls as rain and is “present” on land, then it is “past” in the sphere of air. Its [the droplet's] endless and unavoidable flow of rising and falling has the future ahead of it and the past behind it. When it is in the ocean, it is “past” for the land, rivers, mountains and such, and it is “future” for the way of air. But the drop of water is always “present” in space [because space is within all of the aforementioned states]. Just as the drop of water has no division of time when it is in endless space [because it is always there in space], and it has nothing to not attain nor anything to attain – in the same way, for the Supreme Self, there is no “kartavya” [something which must be done] or divisions of time. — End Footnote. — Upon arriving at the state of equipoise in samadhi and becoming transformed into the Pure “I” above the sheath of the universe, the sadhak sees that in the sheath of the universe, the obligatory actions, the things to be attained, the things not to be attained – all of these things after which he/she had been running because of the perception of lack – are nothing but delusion. It is because the sadhak is present in the actions as the Witness that all of the actions of the universe are being carried out. The sadhak is actually not doing anything at all. The sadhak was only tied up in the possession of one's own doership because of being in love with Maya due to being under the power of ignorance."
23,"O Partha [Arjuna]! If I become “atandrita” [disengage; unwearied] even once and not remain in action, then all of the “manushya” [people] would follow My way of reversal. ","Now, Srigurudev is showing the sadhak that by being “atandrita” [disengaged; unwearied] — Begin Footnote. — While continuously performing Kriya, if, at the time of coming upon samadhi, the mind takes up the worldly matters and stops acting – if that happens one does not become “ataindrita” [be unwearied; disengaged from the senses]. This is because keeping mind in the worldly experience is “tandra” [drowsiness; weariness]. Keeping the mind in the Self is “jagaran” [being awake]. It is only when Consciousness is taken up at the time of the ending of the mind that the state of “atandrita” [beyond weariness] and non-doing takes place. — End Footnote. —  – meaning: casting off the union with the worldly experience, being firm in intellect, and being separated from action, with all of the various aspects of the vrittis [functionalities] (“manushya” [people]) completely extinguished – the Endlessly Vast, Unmoving State of the Self – that State is attained. Then - “I am All, I am all, there is nothing that is not I” - this type of Awareness comes forth. — Start Footnote. — The reason for this happening is this: when there is the “I”-ness, like the currents becoming active in iron in the presence of a magnet, all of the elements, being under the cover of different sheaths and keeping their particularities distinct, become active in their unique and distinct ways. When the “I”-ness ends, all of the activities come to an end. (Understanding through imagining, or explaining through language, does not give any correct representation. Unless that state is attained, the true feeling of that is not known by the heart.) — End Footnote. —"
24,"If I do not perform action, then all of these “lokas” [people; or: planes of existence] would perish, and I would be the cause of everything mixing together, and I would be the cause of the destruction of all of these creatures.","Upon being “atandrita” [see sloka 3:23] and thereupon crossing past the karmic imperative - “pṛthveesheerNA jale magnA jalaṃ magnancha tejasi; leenaṃ vAyau tathA tejo vyomni vAto layaṃ yayau; avidyAyAṃ mahAkasho leeyate parame pade” - etc. — Begin Footnote. — This is from the Shiva Samhita, First Patala, sloka 83. [Translators' note: In current versions of the Shiva Samhita, this is sloka 78 of Chapter 1.] Its meaning: in Layayoga [the yoga of dissolution] the earth-element diminishes and merges with the water-element, and water merges into heat (fire). Similarly (in that same way), fire merges with air, air merges with “vyoma” [ether] (space), and Mahakash [the great space] merges with Avidya, and the Avidya merges with Param Pada [Supreme Thing] (Param Brahman). — End Footnote. —  [see footnote following this sloka 2:24 for translation] – in Layayoga [the yoga of dissolution], all of the elements diminish, and, with one merging into another [level by level], get to the uppermost stage. At that time, the union of the Prakritic substance and the Substance of the Self causes “sankara” [blending together] to happen. Things opposite to each other coming together in one place is that which is called “sankara.” When this type of “sankara” takes place, the creation-facing functionality of Prakriti comes to an end, and functionality becomes Brahman-directed, and “praja” [creature] (that which has been born) – meaning: all of those vrittis [functionalities] by which creation flourishes – those are destroyed. (When this state is attained, one knows quite well that the sadhak is the lord over Prakriti. It is then that the “swami” epithet happens to the sadhak."
25,O Bharat [Arjuna]! The unwise act while being attached to action. The wise person who intends to do “lokasangraha” [benefit people; or: gathering of planes of existence] should act without attachment.,"Those who are operated by mundane intelligence and only pursue their own sense-pleasures, yet, because of not taking recourse in the intelligence of spiritual enquiry, cannot know the true nature of those pleasures – those are the unwise. And those that take up the intelligence of spiritual enquiry, and through detachment leave behind the pleasures of the world and take care to attain the Bliss of the Self – those are the wise. The intense effort with which the unwise perform karma [ordinary acts; or: rites] in desirousness, like: “give me wealth,” “give me children,” “give me fame” etc. - the wise too must perform karma [spiritual act], with exactly the same kind of intense effort, but absolutely without attachment. Then the wise person can do “loka sangraha” [gathering of beings; gathering of planes] - meaning: by drawing up all of the vrittis from all of the locations such as Muladhar etc. through Layayoga [the yoga of merging], the sadhak will be able to attain settledness in True Brahman. — Begin Footnote. — In the way that the unwise perform karma [rites; acts] – being attached because of not knowing the true nature of pleasures due to the lack of a discerning intellect – in actuality only the worldly experience is worshipped using God's name in those acts. And in the results of those rites/acts, the gods of worldly enjoyments are attracted, and because of that happening, one has to be bound up in the worldly experience. The true happiness of the Self is not attained. — End Footnote. — "
26,"The wise persons do not bring about discernment by intellect in the ignorant people who are attached to acts [for pleasures]. They [the wise] become unified (themselves), take up all kinds of actions and engage (them in acts).","— Begin Footnote. — This is the usual translation of this sloka [3:26] [meaning: the Bengali translation above]. But  - in this sloka – by what type of performance of karma [spiritual act] the sadhak will be able to have discernment of intellect – because this teaching is there [in this sloka], what happens when one is attached to actions [for the attainment of pleasure] and what happens if one is unified (unattached) – only this has been shown [in the commentary section]. How the sadhak is supposed to move forward him/herself – the teaching of that is what is necessary. How the sadhak is supposed to affect the others – that teaching is not necessary. Thus, by keeping the subject matter pertaining to Kriya, this kind of explanation to the meaning of this sloka is presented here: that discernment by intellect does not come about for the ignorant who are attached to the karmas [rites and acts for the attainment of pleasure]. For this reason, the wise should become unified (unattached) and, engage in all karmas in a disciplined way. — End Footnote. — If one is able to attain attentiveness exactly in the center of Kutastha (in the middle), a hole will be seen. That is called the “bhramari guha.” The mouth of that “guha” [cave] is luminous and dark, but it is surrounded on all sides by radiant rays of light, and it [the cave] is protected by the two Mahashaktis [great powers] of “veiling” and “throwing out.” If sight is placed there, one gets thrown out. Otherwise, it [sight] gets covered up, like a curtain covering something up. Brahmacharya [celibacy; or: self-control], sattvic diet, sattvic behavior, the abandoning of cravings to enjoy worldly life, steady and patient persevering, and prana-Kriya – through the practice of these, peaceful energy grows in the body, and then the seeing power that pierces through the space in the middle of the eyebrows [internally] is born. That [sight] is never again covered up or thrown out by those powers of veiling and throwing out. Then, if one looks into the mouth of the cave, the mouth of the cave expands open and one is able to see within [that mouth]. One gets to know the matters of spirituality. That is why there is the scriptural saying: “dharmasya tattvaṃ nihitaṃ guhAyaṃ” [the knowledge of spirituality is hidden in the cave]. Now, cutting through the [dual powers of] veiling and throwing out is that which is known as the “discernment by intellect.” — Begin Footnote. — “Buddhiyukta” [union by intellect] as written in Chapter 2, sloka 50, and “buddhibheda” [discernment by intellect [stated in this sloka 3:26]] are operatively the same thing! — End Footnote. — This is because upon going above the level of the intellect, when the intellect becomes still, that [experience] happens. This discernment by intellect does not happen for the ignorant or those who are attached to karmas [rites and acts for gaining pleasures]. This is because: for one, the person is ignorant, and then on top of that there is attachment, both of which cause such a great attraction to the worldly experience that one cannot even get near that cave; far be it to talk about overcoming the rejection [throwing out]. For this reason, the wise become unified – meaning: abandon attachments, and keep steady attention on Kutastha, and thereupon taking up all karmas, become engaged [in spiritual practice]. When that happens, discernment by intellect will take place. Earth, water, fire, air, ether – these are the things that are known as “all.” In exhalation and inhalation, the individual “thokkar[s]” [strikes] of prana that one has to make in all of them [in the elements] – those are the individual karmas [rites]. That karma has to be done by being in the brahmanadi; one should not go into contact with the chakras. It is by [doing] this that the “taking up” of all [karmas] takes place. When, via the offering of prana, the powers of each chakra awaken, and beautiful Light appears within, then one has to take the prana-Kriya from each chakra, make them as one, establish it in the center – the middle of the eyebrows,*26 and apply Shambhavi. This is that which is referred to as the “taking up of all karmas in a disciplined way and becoming engaged.” Taking the prana-Karma up above in this way and being stationed in the Agya, the mind and prana become one. Thus, the mind does not come down any more. It stays locked with its attention on Kutastha. Then the inner sky becomes filled with thousand-fold Light — Begin Footnote. — That also happens in Yoni-mudra, but that does not last. However, it is first through the practice of Yoni-mudra that the vision of that path comes to be experienced. — End Footnote. —; one sees the bhramari [guha], [which was previously] covering its beauty. Its dual powers of veiling and throwing out automatically become powerless. And it is through the destruction of that veiling and throwing out that the knowledge of spiritual matters become directly known."
27,All actions are taking place via the gunas [operating qualities] of Prakriti. But those whose hearts are deluded by ego – these types of people think “I am the doer.”,"In the body, each particular vritti [functionality] has a particular instrument/mechanism dedicated to it. Just as eyes, ears, nose and such are instruments dedicated to the outer vrittis, in the same way the brain is the instrument dedicated to the inner vrittis. Amongst the inner vrittis, there are one hundred types of mental vrittis, and six types of intellectual vrittis. Some of these vrittis are called: attraction, repulsion, aggression; envy, disdain, trepidation; lust, anger, greed; delusion, pride, jealousy; delight, shame, fear; boastfulness, arrogance, vanity; mercy, being enamored, affection; worry, grief, anguish; serenity, determination, discipline; forgiveness, endurance, sense control; giving, meditation, chanting; memory, intelligence, steadfastness; satisfaction, nourishment, contentment; discrimination, detachment, knowledge; pleasure, pain; desire, hope; craving, indulgence; ego, honesty; humility, friendliness, seriousness, magnanimity; courage, boldness; tenderness, devotion etc. The “mastishka” [brain] or “magaj” [brain], is a wondrous thing. It is such a creation by the Creator that although it is made of one basic material, because of its form, size, and the differences in proportions of the sections, as well as the greater or lesser amounts of folds and coils, it is the center, or instrument, that carries out the activities of diverse vrittis. It is because of the differences in the formation of the brain that a person is either good or bad. The more the instruments/tools are that one has in one's brain, the more are the types of activities that one can perform. And again, the level of quality in the formations of each of the instruments/tools leads to the acuteness or weakness in their powers. It is through those instruments that the thing called “I” - or the Self – carries out the activities. Thus, if there are no instruments, the Self cannot carry out the works. Just as: if the eyes, ears etc. become disabled, or if they are not there, one cannot see or hear – in the same way, if parts of any nerves in the brain have any aberrations, or if they are absent, the activities of the vrittis associated with those nerves also do not get carried out. Actually, all of the activities that there are – they all get done through the instruments of the body or the gunas of Prakriti. The Self does not do them. However, it is because of the Self's presence that all of these are able to work. And more: whichever guna takes predominance at whichever time – all of the sense-organs also carry out their activities under the power of that guna. At that time, there is no way the activities of the other gunas can take place. Everyone, sadhak or non-sadhak, knows that if grief and sorrow comes to the mind, at that time, no work, or things that are dutiful or undutiful, can be accomplished. The body and mind become unable to work. When, with the help of enthusiasm, valorous and heroic feelings come about – at that time words of grief and sorrow, or the differences between dutiful and undutiful, find absolutely no place in the mind. The warriors state at the time of war is just like this. Then again, when the mind becomes absorbed in spiritual thoughts – at that time the earthly grief, sorrow, being enamored, affection, the hope of betterment and efforts etc. are seen to be extremely petty. To sum it up: as long as the mind is absorbed in a particular way of thinking/feeling, no effort can turn the mind to another direction for that time. And again, it can been seen that many times the capabilities and efforts of the body are not enough to fulfill a desire of the mind, and the results that come about by doing the necessary work [in order to fulfill said desire] are not satisfactory to the mind. From this it can be understood quite well that Prakriti is truly the predominant one in the matters of activities. The “I” has no primacy [in this]. Still, the prevalence of the ego is such that the sense “I am the doer” automatically rises up in the mind."
28,"O Mahabaho [mighty armed one; Arjuna]! The separation between the gunas and the Self, and the separation between actions and the Self – the one who knows the truth of these two – that person knows that all of the sense-organs are being engaged in the worldly experience (I am not being engaged), and thus does not have the vanity of doership.","When the sadhana of the Kriya of the Self excels, the gunas, acts and the Self and all of these – the truth of their separateness and how actions take place come to be known experientially. And through discernment of intellect, the pure “I” aspect blossoms forth. Then, all of the activities get carried out automatically because of sense-organs connecting with the worldly experience. The sense “I am doing” does not come at all."
29,"Those persons who, taken over by the vanity of the body and feeling the vanity of doership of the activities of sound and touch and such, They are “akritsnavit” [persons with incomplete knowledge] and are “manda” [not good]. The “kritsnavit” [one with complete knowledge] (knower of everything) does not disturb them.","The one who knows “kritsna” (the universe) – he/she is “kritsnavit” - God (Kutastha Chaitanya); and the “akritsnavit” [one who does not know the whole] is jiva. — Begin Footnote. — The one who has forgotten his/her Self because of being under the power of ignorance, the one who is the ruler of this body, the one who is the holder of all of the pranas, the one who, even after having being known by the name “consciousness,” is still one of little knowledge – that person is “jiva.” — End Footnote. — The jiva who is “manda” [not good] – meaning: lazy, lethargic – if that person, on top of that becomes engaged in the enjoyments of the world through sound, touch and such – if that happens, then the Lord does not disturb that person – meaning: “mṛtyusaṃsArasAgarat samuddhartA” [the Savior from all of the ocean of samsara-death] – God – Kutastha Purush – does not guide that person. He does not dispel the inner darkness of that person by the Revelation of the Light of Consciousness, and does not show that person the path. That person goes about according to his/her own will and goes on spinning round and round in the worldly experience. — Begin Footnote. — For as long as there is the sense of doership and there is no surrender of oneself to the Lord, the Lord does not take on the responsibility [for the soul] for that long. As soon as surrender takes place, He immediately takes on the responsibility. When her garment was being ripped off, for as long as Draupadi was holding on to her garment and calling Sri Krishna for help, Sri Krishna did not go to help during that time. As soon as she let go of her garment, threw up her arms and completely surrendered to Sri Krishna, He immediately appeared within her and became the garment itself and saved her. [The full account is written in the Mahabharata.] — End Footnote. —"
30,"Surrender all karma [actions and their fruits] to Me and, keeping the mind on the Self, being free of hope/wishfulness and free of affection/attachment, abandon all grief and fight the war.","When the chitta [heart] thinks of nothing else but the One Self, that is when it becomes the spiritual heart. By mentally reciting the Atma-mantra in the “ayata utterance,  — Begin Footnote. — The time that it takes to count “one, two, three, four, five” - if the recitation [of the mantra] is uttered for that long, then the recitation is being done in the “ayata utterance.” — End Footnote. — and keeping the [inner] ear focused in a one-pointed way to that mentally uttered sound and then surrendering, the contemplation of the Self happens. Then there is absolutely no place in the mind for any worldly experience. Explaining in detail the matters of the True Form of the Self, Sankhyayoga, Veda, Knowledge and the establishment in Brahman to the disciple who, due to being overcome by affectionate attachment, is beset by despondency on the battlefield of sadhana, Srigurudev, after first showing the disciple the need for performing karma [spiritual acts], in order to firmly plant the methods of performing that karma, has brought together all of the methods in just a single sloka. The methods are these: (1)     “Mayi sarvANi karmANi saṃnyasya”: karma [spiritual act] has to be offered to “Me.” “O Savior! Here I am endeavoring to perform Kriya. But how to move prana, and how to recite the mantra – I do not understand the mystery of any of this at all. I do not know anything about it either. Please, have mercy on me, and do whatever needs to be done.” Casting off all vanity of mind in this way, and keeping no sense of doership and taking recourse in the natural flow of prana, and, according to the way one has learned the teachings of guru, offering prana in the path of sushumna in that way – if that happens, then the “surrendering of karma to 'Me'” happens. (2)     “AdhyAtma chetasya” [spiritual consciousness/heart]: keeping mind/heart on the Self. Its method has been already stated previously. Leaving the worldly experience and putting mind in the Self is called “asanga shastra” [unencumbered munition]. (3)     “NirAsheeh” [without hope/wishfulness]: People ordinarily attempt to get rid of the exhaustion of the day through sleep at night. Just like the way they stop all thinking and get ready to sleep, when willful thoughts remain in the mind – the mind does not even hold such thoughts – exactly like that, if one stops the thoughts of worldly experience at the start of Kriya, and then engages in Kriya – that is being “nirashi.” (4)     “Nirmamah” [not mine-ness]: There is nothing called “mine.” I am “I”. When there is this type of steady knowing, the state of “nirmama” [not mine-ness] comes about. (5)     “Vigatajvarah” [free of fever/affliction]: During the time of Kriya: “I just can't do it any more; now let me rest a bit,” “let me do a little bit of such and such thing or work; I'll just do Kriya later” - etc.- getting rid of this type of laziness and weakness – meaning: the way of situating oneself where there is no taking in of any kind of distress into the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] – that is called “vigatajvarah” [being free of afflictions]. Being situated in that way – meaning: being armored with those types of weaponry and munitions, one has to join in the battle of sadhana (one has to endeavor into it)."
31,"All of those people, upon being “shraddhavan” [reverent] and “asuavihin” [free of spitefulness], who always practice this teaching of Mine – they are the ones who become free from all karma.","Having faith in the Vedanta spoken by guru, and being engaged in the undisturbed practice of that [teaching] – that is called “shraddha” [reverence]. And not seeing fault in others' qualities is called being “asuavihin” [free of spite or ill thoughts towards others]. Those who do not find any fault with Kriya taught by guru – meaning: not thinking like this: “what is this work that gurudev is making me do; this is nothing” - but instead, having unwavering faith in guru's teaching, engage in the practice of Kriya, and practice Kriya according to the instructions regularly and every day, and do not alter the time of Kriya practice – or not do Kriya, because of some work or because of laziness – they are the ones, verily, who get freedom from the bondage of karma. Others do not get it. (See the next sloka [3:32].) "
32,"But those who, being “asuyayukta” [spiteful], do not practice this teaching of Mine – know those ones to be without discrimination, ignorant of all knowledge and ruined (bound for destruction).","Those who are not [the following:] reverent, free of spite and regular practitioners – qualities mentioned in the previous sloka [3:32] – meaning: those who do not practice Kriya according to instructions daily, those who find fault in others' qualities, praise themselves, and do not have any enthusiasm to practice guru's teachings – they are “achetasah” [unconscious; ignorant] – devoid of discrimination – meaning: they cannot have the knowledge of all things. Thus – far be it to talk about Liberation – they are “sarvagyanavimooDhah” [ignorant of all knowledge] – meaning: sound, touch, sight, taste, smell – they, being completely ignorant of the knowledge of all of these things (completely without Self-knowledge [alternate translation: lost in unconsciousness]), are ruined – meaning: falling in the cycles of samsara, they go round and round like unconscious beings. Know this. (Therefore: dear sadhak! Please engage yourself in the practice of the Kriya of the Self with full alertness and care.) "
33,Even “gyanavan[s]” act according to their own “prakriti” [nature; phenomenal nature]. All beings go according to their “prakriti.” What will force accomplish?,"“SattvarajastamasAṃ sAmyAvasthA prakṛtih” - sattva, rajah, tama – the unified state of these three gunas is called “prakriti” [nature; phenomenal nature – common noun]. When this unified state breaks, Prakriti [as the Primal Force – proper noun] becomes divided into “para” and “apara” - these two sections, and becomes active. “Apara” comprises of: earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect, ego – these eight  types. “Para” is: the Goddess – in the form of Life in the living beings – Who is the foundation and operator of creation. She also has been referred to as Akshara Purush [the Indestructible Being] in some places. All of these are mechanisms; they become active because of the connection with Spirit. It is upon being endowed with these that the jiva exists as “mamaivaṃshah” [My [the Lord's] eternal parts]. When this jiva becomes determined to become complete, then he/she takes up the character of being “gyanavan” [knowledgeable] and makes effort according to his/her own nature – meaning: in the way that activity-producing Prakriti continuously tries to keep the jiva in Her dominion, the “gyanavan” [spiritually directed person] tries to bring Prakriti under control in just the same way – meaning: “yato yato nishcarati      manashchanchalasthiram; tatostato niyamaitatAtmanyeva vashaṃ nayet” [whenever and wherever the restless and unsteady mind wanders, one should take it from there and at that very time and bring it to be disciplined in the Self [or: bring it back regularly to be under the control of the Self]]; the sadhak remains engaged in the Kriya of the Self according to this dictum. What happens due to that kind of effort is this: all of the “bhoota[s]” go to Prakriti – meaning: all of the sense-organs attain a state of unity and equilibrium. This happens automatically. One does not have to force it (and forcing it does not make it happen either). When the jiva becomes locked in Supreme Shiva, consciousness also draws and gathers itself into that Place; it does not stay in the body. Thus, all of the sense-organs become non-active."
34,"Within the essential aspects of sound, touch and such [the senses], there is attraction (affection) and repulsion in each of the senses. Do not fall under the powers of those attractions and repulsions. This is because attraction and repulsion are obstructors or obstacles for the spiritual aspirant.","In the early stages, Kriya does not always happen with the same kind of ease [all the time]. Even if it happens some days, the “shravana” [hearing], “manana” [contemplating], “kirtan” [praise], “darshan” [witnessing revelations] and such do not happen at all. And some days, one of them happens, and another does not happen. When this kind of thing takes place, attraction and repulsion come into being – meaning: if Kriya goes well, then there is affection towards Kriya; and if Kriya does not go well, then there is disdain towards Kriya. But if one falls in this kind of way to the powers of attraction and repulsion, Prakriti cannot be brought under control. And if that does not happen [if Prakriti is not brought under control], Liberation also does not happen. Instead of being pleased or displeased with ease or unease [respectively], the positive feeling of goodness about oneself that comes about from doing one's duty – if one just holds on to that and relies on Srigurudev, never will the Prakritic restlessness or the effects of vata, pitta, kapha [humors of the body] or any other obstacles be able to obstruct."
35,It is better to be in one's own dharma [way of being] without any qualities than to be properly established in another's dharma [way of being]. It is best to die in one's own dharma. The dharma of another is frightful.,"The thing in the body that is called “I” - that is “sva” [one's own]; and that which is called “mine”  - that is “par” [others']. “I” means the Self. Thus, it is the Self that is “sva.” “Mine” means the tri-guna filled twenty-four elements. Thus, all of those are “par.” What is the Self like? Like - “sacchidAnandasvaroopah” [Existence/Truth, Consciousness and Bliss Itself] – that which remains in the same state [or: the same] in all three divisions of time – that is why It is “Sat” [Existence/Truth]; and “Chit” - Consciousness Itself – and “Ananda” [Bliss] – Happiness Itself. How are the twenty-four [elements]? Like - “asanmayah,” “tAmasah,” “nityaṃ vikAravAn” - meaning: untrue, limited, ignorance-filled and always changing. As each one [of the elements] is, each one's dharma is of that particular state. Thus, “svadharma” [one's own dharma] means the Eternal, Aware and Blissful State. “Paradharma” [the dharma of others] means that changing and ignorant state. Because of non-activity in the unified state of the three gunas, the dharma of the Self is without any qualities. And when the three gunas are agitated [into action], because of all activities being carried out [due to that agitation], [it is referred to as] “being properly established in the others' dharma.” Unified equilibrium is freedom from samsara; agitation is bondage to samsara. This is the meaning of: “it is best to be in one's own dharma without any qualities than to be well established in another's dharma.” (If one is not able to stay in the Endless State devoid of the three gunas, it is better to just endure the struggle of the sadhana-practice to attain the State devoid of the three gunas. So it follows that it is not good to throw oneself in Prakritic dharma and think that ignorance is bliss.) If one has a body, then the casting-off of that body, or death, is inevitable. If one dies when one is in the dharma of the Self, then one attains the State of Sacchitananda [Existence/Truth, Consciousness, Bliss]. That is why it is called “best” [to die in that dharma]. And if death happens when one is in “paradharma” [dharma of everything other than the Self], then one loses one's aim, falls into the torrential current of birth and death in the darkness of ignorance in samsara, and has to go around and about [in that]. That is why it is “frightful.”"
36,"“O Varshneya [Sri Krishna]! How is it that, even when one is without desire, one becomes involved in sinful ways as if being forced to do so, and by what or whom does one become thusly engaged?”","The Kriyavan sadhak has understood quite well that: by performing Kriya according to the teachings in slokas 30 and 33 [of this Chapter 3], the sense of stillness comes about; it is then possible to forget the world/creation; one attains the way to the Self. But during the performance of Kriya, the sadhak sees that: Kriya is going on; it is going on well; the attention on Kutastha is quite well established; there is not even a little bit of desire to leave that and look elsewhere; but even when there is no desire, it seems that, against one's will, someone/some power pulls the helpless mind to other directions, destroys its focus and puts it in all kinds of restlessness. Thus, through self-enquiry, the sadhak is searching to find out – why does this happen? What is the cause? (See Chapter 10, sloka 37 for the meaning of the word “Varshneya.”) "
37,"The Lord said, “This rises from the rajoguna – the intense desire, impossible to fulfill. This is anger. Know this to be the “vairee” [evil] (enemy) here (in the path of Liberation).","The sadhak is knowing through self-search: desire is verily the reason for this [see sloka 3:36 above for the query]. Just as desire is the wish to have something, similarly the wish to not have anything or get rid of anything is also desire. This desire comes forth from the rajoguna, which is spread out from the Agya to the Muladhar. Craving is the cause itself – the activity of rajas. — Begin Footnote. — The activity of sattva – contentment; the activity of tamas – settledness. — End Footnote. — While doing pranayam, for as long as the mind does not enter the Agya through the brahmanadi, for that long does that craving, or the attraction to worldly experiences remain. It tries to pull the mind away; it eventually does take the helpless mind. If that pull happens according to the wish, then the desire transforms into joy. And if that happens against the wish, then disdain/hate shows up. Actually, joy and hate are two types of the limited results of desire. Both of these results are operatively the same. Both bind the mind in the worldly experience. But because the destructive power of hate is greater [than joy], the emphasis has been put on that [aspect], and desire has been called “anger” [in this sloka]. This desire deludes the mind, making the mind lose self-awareness and lose its way, as well as stopping the mind's upward movement. That is why desire is “vairee” [evil]. And again, even if one stays for an endless amount of time in enjoyments and indulgence, desire is never fulfilled. That is why desire is “mahashan” [voracious] [see 2nd line of sloka 3:37 above for the occurrence of the word]. And because one does not find settledness even after getting something that is desired, desire is “mahapapma” [sinful; evil] [see 2nd line of sloka 3:37 above for the occurrence of the word]. (Not holding on to the desirable or the undesirable, not even paying attention to the results to be attained from karma [yogic act], if one takes recourse in Kriya as a duty, one does not again have to fall into restlessness/agitation.) "
38,"As fire remains covered by smoke, as a mirror remains covered by dirt/dust, and as the womb is covered by the amnion – in the same way, the Knowledge of the Self remains covered by desire.","Seeing one's own form and the results of one's doings is the human being's craving or desire. This craving is, whether without wanting or with wanting, at the root of all works. Without it work cannot even begin. But this craving or desire is also at the end of [alternate translation: within] the fulfillment of craving, or it is in the form of veiling, in the path of yoga. “Karma” [spiritual practice], “upasana” [worshipping; reverently experiencing] and “gyana” [knowing; knowledge] – these three states of sadhana – how desire presents itself in the form of “veiling” in these states is being shown via three similes, in order to make that [matter of veiling] easy to understand. First simile: the covering up of fire by smoke. The temperature that grows from the rubbing of two things with each other – that eventually becomes transformed into fire. As fire burns, smoke also appears. It is just like that in sadhana as well. At first, in the state of karma [practice], because of prana stirring up and striking at the sushumna, out of that an energy comes forth and spreads, making the body energized. Via that energy, the intellect also turns inward. Then a kind of light shines forth within. That light is “gyana-jyoti” [light of knowledge]. By the power of that light, like smoke coming  off of wood and such things [burning material], a particular feeling happens throughout the whole body, and the previously done actions – all of their memories rise up in the mind and cover up the inner sky. The light from the fire of knowledge also gets covered up. But just as when a breeze blows upon the fire covered up by the smoke from wood, the smoke moves away and the fire becomes stronger and the light shines forth – in sadhana too, in the same way, if one patiently remains in the steady posture and diligently continues to drive prana with the Atma-mantra, all of those memories of the past, as well as the physical irritations and pains – all disappear. The fire of knowledge becomes stronger and stronger, and the light, now shining forth, illuminates the inner sky. Second simile: the covering of the mirror with dirt/dust. Just as when one breathes on a mirror, the film of the steam that falls [on the mirror] – if either that kind of film or some other kind of heavy dust is on the mirror – then nothing at all is reflected in that mirror. But when the film from that steam dries up, or if the mirror is dusted and wiped clean, then the process of reflection also happens. In the first stage of sadhana, after the inner sky becomes illuminated due to “karma” [practice] in the first stage of sadhana, the second stage of “upasana” [reverently experiencing; worshipping] comes about. At that time, if one steadies the attention at Kutastha, a white [or: bright], tenderly brilliant sphere of light is gradually seen. That is “Chidakash” [sky of consciousness]. Because this sphere is clear, like a mirror, all of everything is reflected in that. But in the beginning it is covered by “kashmal” [see Chapter 2, sloka 2 of the Gita]. Although that kashmal is of many types, in its fundamental and subtle state, it is white like picked cotton or a milk-white cloud. Just as nothing is reflected on the film of steam on a mirror, even though it is shiny, in the same way, even though the covering is white like a milk-white cloud, nothing at all is reflected in that sphere. When, upon the phlegmatic condition drying up in the path of sushumna due to Kriya, when the prana-vayu subtly, yet powerfully, flows and the electric energy grows in the whole body – because of that energy destroying the mind's connections to experiences of the world, all of the masses of kashmal disappear. Then that sphere takes on a very clean and clear form. At that time, an egg-shaped disc is seen within that sphere. That egg-shaped disc is of a shiny, deep and dark black color. But sometimes it is wrapped by a golden filigree, and sometimes it appears completely golden. That black field within that white field looks just like an eye. That is verily the “That” substance - “diveeva chakshurAtatam” [Divine Eye]. Third simile: The covering of the womb by the amnion. Within the womb, the jiva lives in a thin, liquid-filled sac of skin. That sac of skin is called “ulva” or “jivakosha” [sheath of the jiva]. When the jiva stays within that – at that time that form of that sac is just like an egg. For as long as that sac does not break, for that long does the jiva not come out. After it breaks, the jiva no longer stays in the womb; it comes out. The egg-shaped disc that is seen through the sight of consciousness in the light of knowledge in the inner sky – that is verily the “vishvakosha” [sheath of the universe] or – the universe. — Begin Footnote. — In the process of creation in the Manu [Samhita], this is the “sahasrAṃsushmaprabhaṃ haimaṃ anadam.” — End Footnote. — Present within that sheath is the actualized Vedanta, the Supreme Person. That is why the covering is like the amnion. In this third state [of gyana – knowledge or knowing], desire keeps that knowledge-filled sheath covered. For as long as that sheath is not broken through, for that long is He covered within that. Only through Shambhavi can that be broken through.  — Begin Footnote. — For the method of piercing Kutastha, see the commentary on sloka 26 of Chapter 3 [of the Gita]. — End Footnote. — In short: during sadhana, at first, desire keeps the inner light covered up like smoke; then after the light shines forth, it takes a form [kashmal] that is visible to personal consciousness, and by clinging to the body of [spiritual] Consciousness, it keeps the field of Consciousness covered up; and finally, when Consciousness is revealed, [desire] keeps the Supreme Destination – the Supreme Person – covered with an egg-shaped covering. Desire shows itself in these three ways. When these three veilings in the three states are destroyed, then one attains the Supreme Goal."
39,"O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! Knowledge remains covered by this eternal enemy to the spiritual person – this desire, the unquenchable fire.","Knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower – these three becoming one in union is the Supreme Goal. In this: the knower is the jiva; the object of knowledge is Shiva or Parabrahman. And knowledge is Shakti as well as the Special State [of Being]. It is through knowledge that the object of knowledge can be known. Then, through spiritual enquiry and intuition, it can be known that all is Brahman and Brahman is all. At that time knowledge is Shakti. And when, via the fruit of the performance of Layayoga (when one finds “laya” [dissolution; merging] through yoga), one attains samadhi. As one comes down and returns again to the path of samsara, it is seen that I am verily “I” or Brahman. At that time knowledge is a State of Being. — Begin Footnote. — The first part of this knowledge is “parokshagyana” [indirect, learned knowledge] and the second is “aparokshagyana” [direct, experiential knowledge]. “Asti brahmeti chet veda parokshagyanameva tat; ahaṃ brahmeti chet veda sAkshAtkArah sa uchyate.” Iti panchadashee. [“Brahman is,” is indirect knowledge [learned from some outside source]; the knowledge “I am Brahman” is through direct Realization; thus it is said. From the Panchadashi.]  — End Footnote. — This knowledge has different stages and proportions. According to that, there are also different gradations of “gyani[s]” [knower[s]]. Thus, one who, upon taking the functionality of being inwardly directed, takes care to enquire about the Self – that one is a “gyani.” And again, one who has ascended to the uppermost point of knowledge and has attained the State of Knowledge – that one is also a “gyani.” The difference is that the first one is on the lowest level of the steps, and the second one is in the uppermost level. The one who has crossed passed the Agya and has attained Stillness – that one is jivanmukta [Liberated while alive in the body]. All of that being's coverings have been destroyed. But the one who is below the Agya – because of his/her mind remaining in the pull of the cravings – new kinds (making the old new again) of wishes for enjoyments go on rising up within his/her antahkarana. These desires face one like the masses of curtains. The light of knowledge by which the inner world is seen – they cover up that light. The inner sight does not open up. Even if one disciplines the mind and makes it desireless through detachment, the influence of Prakriti is such that the mind falls to the power of desires, as if it is benumbed. This is why desire is the “eternal enemy.” — Begin Footnote. — For the “agyani” [the ignorant], during the time of enjoying worldly experiences, desire is about pleasure. But when that ends, desire is about pain. For the “gyani” [knowledgeable one; spiritual person], with the exception of the “meaningful work” [spiritual practice], any experience of the world is about pain. The reason is: if the wants of the mind grow, kashmal [see Chapter 2, sloka 2] comes about in the inner sky; the Light of the Self is covered up. Whenever desire attracts the mind of the sadhak, it is immediately the experience of pain. It does not become pleasure. That is why desire is the “eternal enemy” of the gyani. — End Footnote. — And more, it is like fire. Although fire gives light to other things, no receptacle – such as wood – can contain it. And it inflames, burns and destroys the receptacle itself. For as long as the receptacle is there, for that long does the light of the fire exist. When the receptacle is destroyed, the fire also disappears. Masses of things put into the fire do not satisfy the fire; instead, its flames increase and spread and it goes on consuming. In the same way, desire too, takes its own receptacle, the mind, and heats it up, and goes on increasing the connection with the worldly experience. Just as fire goes out when there is no receptacle for it, in the same way, when the worldly experience is cast off, desire also ends. "
40,"All of the sense-organs, mind and intellect – it is said that these are the grounds of desire. It is through these sense-organs and such that desire keeps the discriminating knowledge covered up and keeps the embodied one in delusion.","Releasing and grasping and such are done through the organs of action; seeing and hearing and such are done through the organs of perception; and meditation, concentration or volition and determination and such are done through the mind and intellect. Thus, all of the sense-organs, mind and intellect are the grounds of desire or wishes. Knowledge too is expressed through the sense-organs, mind and intellect. It is for this reason that knowledge and desire are adversaries to each other. When one is dominant, the other disappears. But the particular difference between these two is this: desire, or the wishes for worldly experiences, can find its ground up to the top of the Agya; it cannot go beyond that. But knowledge can. When knowledge is dominant, it illuminates the entire pathway of the sense-organs, mind and intellect, and thereby allows the evident Self to shine forth, making the embodied being the knower/seer of all, and itself [knowledge] extends up to the junction of Maya-Brahman. But, the fact is that desire, or the wish to have, is dominant simply because one is a jiva; there is no doubt about that. This is because this body itself is there only because of desire in the mind. Otherwise one would not have had to be born. Thus, just as fire does not catch on wet wood, in the same way, as long as desire is present, the light of knowledge does not shine forth. This is why the sky of the heart remains covered in the darkness of the worldly experience; the upward directed sight of the embodied one can only see the worldly experience and not the path of the Self. Then desire, in the form of the delusion, brings about waves of the worldly experience in the mind, intellect and the sense-organs, and by deluding the embodied being, makes one lose oneself. It [desire] smears a deluded understanding of the eternal and true with the worldly experience and throws one into confusion.  "
41,"O greatest of the Bharatas [Arjuna]! For this reason, control all of the sense-organs first, and completely destroy this desire, which is sinful and the destroyer of “gyana-vigyana” [knowledge and particular knowledge] (completely leave it once and for all).","Just as the light of an oil lamp cannot be lit with oil unless there is a wick, in the same way, if desire does not get the support of the sense-organs and such, there is no enjoying/partaking of the worldly experience. Or, if the wick is dense (stiff and hard), just as the light goes out because the wick cannot absorb the oil into it, in the same way, if all of the sense-organs are controlled (meaning: not letting them go to “vishaya” [the external matters] of the outside and keeping them locked in the “avishaya” [the non-external matters] — Begin Footnote. — All of that which can be seen or heard are of the external. They are experienced only in the physical body. All of that is called “bahirvishaya” [experiences/matters of the outer world]. But, in the practice of yoga, all of that which is seen and heard upon stopping the sense-organs – those are not of the outside; they are of the inside. Because they are extremely subtle, they are experienced in the subtle body. Those are called “antarvishaya” [matters of the inner world]. This “antarvishaya” is the same as “avishaya” [non-external matters]. “Antarvishaya” is Shakti or qualities [such as “tanmatra” - the faculties of experience behind the sense-organs]; “bahirvishaya” is the action/manifestation coming from that [such as the sensory experience]. — End Footnote. —  within), because of the experience of the worldly matters not happening through them [sense-organs], desire automatically gets destroyed; one becomes free of it. This is why the teaching in this sloka is: first the sense-organs have to be brought under control. — Begin Footnote. — In the beginning stages of sadhana, “avishaya” [see note 37 above] cannot even be conceived. At that time, if one keeps one's attention at all times on the path shown by guru, and keeps unwavering faith in guru's words, and practices Kriya according to injunctions like a stupid person, [eventually] the ability comes about to enter within. Later, upon the practice of “samyama,” there is no need for any effort at all. See Chapter 6 [of the Gita] for instructions on practice.  — End Footnote. — It is only then that desire can be destroyed, or cast off. Without destroying or casting off desire, the springing forth of “gyana-vigyana” [knowledge and particular knowledge] is destroyed, and sin, in the form of the restlessness of the worldly experience, grows. “gyana” [knowledge]: “j” = “jayman” [victorious]; “n” = the essence of scent – meaning: the worldly experience; “a” = “asakti” [addiction; attachment]; “n[a]” = “nasti” [non-existence]. The meaning of the letters of “gyana” is: not to have any addiction/attachment to the creation-preservation-destruction endowed earth-bound worldly experience. “Vigyana” [particular knowledge]: “vi” = “vishesh” [particular/special] – particular/special knowledge. The awareness of the Whole of Consciousness/Spirit is “gyana.” The awareness of individual consciousness is “vigyana.” This means: The Knowledge of the Self that happens upon merging with the Self – that is “gyana.” And knowledge of all of the substances/matters such as earth etc. - that is “vigyana.” To make it a little clearer: the Self is all; the awareness that comes from this firm knowing – that is what is called “gyana.” With the support of “gyana,” through extremely precise investigation, the particular and complete understanding that comes about regarding all of the individual elements – that is “vigyana.” Putting it simply: “so'haṃ” [I am That] – this Knowledge is the only “gyana.” Everything else besides that is “vigyana.” “gyana” and “vigyana” are related to each other. When perception looks downward after experiencing the depth of “gyana,” there is “vigyana.” And upon experiencing the depth of “vigyana,” when perception looks upward, becomes steady and stays locked there – then “gyana” is attained."
42,The aggregate of the sense-organs are said to be high. Higher than all of the sense-organs is mind. Higher than the mind is the intellect. But the One Who is higher than the intellect – that is the One Who is “dehee” [the embodied one].,"The sense-organs are ten in number – five are dedicated to perception and five are dedicated to action. It is through these ten sense-organs that the external experience is had. Simply due to their nature, physical things are of the external experience, and are born of the five subtle elements' five mechanisms. These physical things of the external experience are experienced in the forms of sound, touch, sight, taste and smell. The sources/mechanisms of the worldly experience are the sense-organs. That is why, amongst the things associated with the enjoyment of the external experience, the aggregate of the sense-organs are highest. But the aggregate of the sense-organs are things that come from the activities of the gunas, such as sound etc.; in other words, they are tied to, or operated by, Shakti. These things that emerge the activities of the gunas are the “antarvishaya” [see note 37 with sloka 41 of this Chapter 3]  or “tanmatra[s]” [the faculties of experience behind the sense-organs], which can be experienced inside in the subtle body through the practice of yoga by stopping all of the sense-organs, which are causalities themselves, and for which the sense-organs are mechanisms, and whose actions/manifestations are the external experiences. Thus, this “antarvishaya” [inner matters] are higher than the sense-organs. This “antarvishaya” [internal source of the external experience] has been referred to as “artha” in the Upanishads, — Begin Footnote. — * “indriyebhyah parAh hyarthA arthebhyashcha paraṃ manah manasastu parA buddhih buddherAtma mahAn parah mahatah param vyaktamavyaktAt puruSho parah puruShAnna paraṃ kinchit sA kAShThA sA parA gati” - kathopaniShat 1:3:10-11 [Higher than the senses are “artha” [the faculties of experience behind the senses [tanmatra or antarvishaya]]; higher than the “artha” is the mind; the intellect is higher than the mind, beyond which is the great self. Beyond the Mahat [great cause] is the Inexpressible; beyond the Inexpressible is the Supreme Person. There is nothing whatsoever beyond the Supreme Person. That is the culmination. That is the Supreme Destination.] - Katha Upanishad 1:3:10-11 — End Footnote. —  and has been said to be higher than the sense-organs. But there is no mention of this in the Gita because: although the causes of activities/manifestations and their mechanisms can be thought of as different in analysis, in actual works [alternate translation: in practical terms [meaning: in activity]] they are the same. Higher than this “antarvishaya” is mind. This is because mind emerges from the sattvic part of the aggregate of the five primal elements. And the ten sense-organs emerge from the separate sattvic part and the separate rajasic part of the five primal elements, and are operated by the volition and non-volition of the mind. Higher than the mind is the intellect. This is because the mind is blind. The intellect resembles “pragya” [higher awareness]. The non-investigative activities of relinquishing-grasping [and such] are of the mind; and the activities of finding the certainty of truth and untruth through investigation is of the intellect. The one who is beyond this intellect is the self. As the witness of all, this self resides within all. It is the embodied being. Desire can cover it with delusion, but cannot touch it. (This embodied being is indeed the jiva or the self-element. Higher than the self-element is the Mahat-tattva [great substance; great cause]; higher than the Mahat is Avyakta [the Inexpressible], and higher than the Avyakta is Purush [Supreme Person]. There is nothing beyond Purush. That is the Supreme Destination.)"
{43}{stop},"O Mahabaho [mighty-armed one; Arjuna]! Having known in this way that the Self is greater than the intellect, via the Self still the mind, intellect and the aggregate of the sense-organs and kill this difficult to conquer enemy known as desire.","Because the intellect is a ground for desire, it becomes distorted through the contact with worldly experiences and the senses. But the Self is free of distortions. It is the witness of all. Therefore, the Self is greater than the intellect. O sadhak! This Self is indeed “you” - meaning: your real being. Having known in this way that you are greater than the intellect, take up the certainty of intellect or the intelligence of the Self – meaning: “I am greater than all and I am free from change; desire cannot touch me; but when I become deluded, that is my confusion; it is like: when, in a game about going around in circles, children go round and round in circles, close their eyes and fall down, and then they see that the world is going round and round – it [the confusion] is only a movement like that and nothing more” - having this kind of steady faith, make the mind still and unmoving. If that happens, then the mind will be “I”-filled. Even though the mind is the mover of desire, desire will not be again able to move about in the mind. Thus, it will come under your power. Then it can be killed. This is the one and only way to be victorious over and destroy desire. That is why desire has been called “durasada” [see last word of sloka 3:43 above] (meaning: it can be brought under one's control with great difficulty). Thus ends the commentary on the third chapter of Sri Pranab Gita - “Karmayoga.”"
