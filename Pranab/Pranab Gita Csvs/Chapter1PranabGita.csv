1,"[The blind king] Dhritarashtra said, “O Sanjaya! After gathering with the intention of war, what did the two sides of my sons and the sons of Pandu do?”","“Dhritaṃrashtraṃ yena sah 'dhritarashtrah.'” [one who holds the kingdom is “Dhritarashtra”] The word “dhrita” [means/refers to]: “one who is holding.” “Rashtra” means “kingdom.” The one who is holding/presiding over the kingdom is “Dhritarashtra.” The one whose presence is spread throughout the kingdom in the form of this body – it he that is “Dhritrashtra” - meaning: “mind.” The mind does not have the ability [on its own] to take in or enjoy [or partake in] the experiences of sound and touch and such [sense experiences]. Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin – all of the things that are experienced through these organs of perception – the mind experiences only that. This is why the mind is called “blind.” Dhritarashtra is blind as well. See the commentary in the 2nd and 21st slokas for the meaning of “Dhritarashtra said.”
 
“dharmakshetre kurukshetre”
 
The name of this body is “kshetra” [field]. Because of the particular and different activities of the three gunas, it [the body] is divided in three sections. The ten sense organs (meaning: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin – these five sense-organs of perception; and speech, hands/arms, feet/legs, anus and the sex organ – these five sense-organs of action) make up its first section. The sushumna nadi that is nested in the spinal column – that sushumna and the six-chakras enjoined to it make up the second section. And the place of “ten fingers” [length] from the top of the Ajna-chakra to the Sahasrar [chakra] is [the body's] third section. In the first section, the functions of the external world are carried out. This [section] is rajas-tamas predominant. Because of the never-ending flow of action taking place in this section, it is called “Kurukshetra” or the field of work/action. The third section is sattva-tamas predominant. Here, there is the action-less Still-Light, and that is why it is called “Dharmakshetra” [the field of spirituality]. And the second section, the one that is the playground of “manas” [surface mind] and “buddhi” [intellect/intelligence], the place from where all of the subtle elements when turned outward activate the powers of the senses, and again, when turned inward, reveal the Light of the Self – that [place] of the sushumna – with the six chakras enjoined to it – is rajas-sattva predominant. Because this place is host to both dharma [spirituality] and karma [action], it is referred to [in the sloka] as “Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra” [field of spirituality, field of action]. Although this [particular] section of the “field” [body] is rajas-sattva predominant, there are variances in the proportions of the presence of the [different] gunas. The area that is close to the Muladhar [chakra] and belonging to Kurukshetra – there the amount of rajoguna is more and the amount of sattva-guna is less. In the same way, the area that is close to the Ajna [chakra] and belonging to Dharmakshetra – there the amount of sattva is more, and the amount of rajas is less. And in the middle of the entire distance from the Ajna to the bottom of the Muladhar – meaning: at the Manipur [chakra] – the amounts of these two (rajas [and] sattva) are the same [equal in proportion]. This is why this is the residing place of the “saman vayu” [air of equal-ness]. This is the “Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra” spoken about [in the sloka]. This is what is known as the “yogamarga” [“path” of yoga]. (See Illustration No. 3 [in the Introduction section].) At the lowermost point of this “path” in the Muladhar resides the desire- and enjoyment-attributed “Kulakundalini Shakti.” Lifting that Kulakundalini through this “path of yoga” through the use of particular techniques/practices, and thereby piercing the Ajna chakra — Begin Footnote. — The Ajna-chakra is filled with ignorance; thus another name for it is “Ajnana-chakra” [chakra of ignorance]. — End Footnote. — and taking [Her] to the Sahasrar and uniting Her with Supreme Shiva there is what is called “yoga.”

“mAmakAh pANDavah”
 
“Mamaka” [my kin] are “manovritti” [active aspects of the “manas” mind or ordinary mind], and “pandava” [of the family of Pandu] are “buddhivritti” [active aspects of “buddhi” - intellect or personal intelligence]. What this means is this: those [vrittis/active aspects] that reveal the real truth – those are aspects of intellect/intelligence. And those that think the reverse of that [real truth] are the aspects of mind. The reflection that is seen in the mirror when standing in front of it, at first it appears as if that is the real form of the body, but after analyzing it through intellect, one sees that that is not the real form of the body, [but that it is] a reversed image; meaning: - the right side of the body is now changed to the left side [in the reflection]. That is why sages have said, “vishvaṃ darpaNanagareetulyaṃ” [the universe is similar to a city [seen] in a mirror]. In that same way, the Knowledge of the Self and the delusion of the world [are like] the body and its reflection [respectively]; it is like “a necklace strung without a string” [a Bengali allegory]. Whatever the mind [manas] sees in front of it, it accepts it as truth, and it becomes magnetized to that very thing and acts either for or against it. Because of its primacy amongst the senses, and because it remains wrapped up in the matters taken in by the senses, the mind is always addicted to the matters of the world. This is because addiction/attachment comes about through association. “SangAt saṃjAyate kAmah” [being in the company [of a thing] brings about desire [for the thing]].  So, what I'm saying is this: the current within the antahkarana [inner operators] that ceaselessly flows in the direction of worldly matters – that is “manovritti” [vritti[s]/active aspect[s] of  mind]. This current flows in different kinds of waves, and according to the particular places and directions. Each wave is a “vritti” [particular active aspect] of the mind. Therefore, manovritti [vrittis of mind] are many. The many different expressions of the world-directed currents of manovritti – these are “mamaka” [my kin], meaning: the aggregate of desires. These are the “one hundred sons” of Dhritarashtra – the mind, [and] the “one hundred brothers” including Duryodhana and such. It is they that are known as “pravritti” (meaning: - the vrittis [active aspects] that go towards samsara, or the aggregate of undutiful/non-productive things), such as: lust, anger, greed, delusion, pride, miserliness, [excessive] sleep, drowsiness, laziness, infatuation, repulsion, affection, possessive love etc.
 
Whatever the buddhi [intellect/intelligence] sees in front of it, it makes itself certain of [the thing] – meaning: measures it. The Self is [the buddhi's] yardstick. The result of this measuring shows that things are divided into two categories. One is “Sat” [Truth or Reality – in this case: belonging to Truth] – that which is eternal and unlimited (even though “tadarthiya karma” [action to get to Truth] is limited, it belongs in this category because it takes one to “Sat”), and the other is “asat” - that which is temporal and limited. Separating the Sat and asat by comparing each to the Self is that which is called “vastuvichar” [the analysis of things]. As the Self is the yardstick in this vastuvichar, the “buddhivritti” [active aspects of intelligence] flow extremely subtly, yet ceaselessly, towards the Self. This is the second current of the antahkarana. This also manifests as different kinds of waves according to the various types of things. The different expressions of this current directed towards the Self are what [together] is called “pandavah” [those belonging to Pandu] (“pandu iti jnAne” [“pandu” means “in wisdom”]) - meaning: the group of dutiful/worthy aspects. These are known as “nivritti” (meaning: the active aspects that are non-samsaric [or: those aspects that turn away from samsara]) – for example: discrimination [between sat and asat], discernment/enquiry/analysis, detachment/non-attachment, serenity, self-control, endurance, satiety, reverence, resolve, intense spiritual longing/focus etc.
 
In the antahkarana, these two currents [manovritti and buddhivritti] are always active. Because of this, as different things/events come into contact [with the person], either one or the other [current], or both mixed, become alternatively powerful; neither stays permanently. But, just as in the science of electricity, when ends of two wires of two opposite currents are connected together, one of the two currents is overcome [by the other] and the other [stronger current] expands greatly and flows in an unending and powerful flow, similarly, if by some way with some technique (a technique that has to be learned from guru's teachings) these two vrittis are connected together, then one vritti (directed towards worldly things) is overcome [by the other vritti] and the other vritti (directed towards the Self) becomes more powerful and flows ceaselessly towards the Self. It is this that is called “yuktavastha” [the state of being connected] or “karmavastha” [the state of the act] while abiding in yoga. If one remains in this state, a movement upward happens which upends the dimensions of time named “past” and “future” and only the “present” stays in awareness. Thus, it is possible for one to be knowledgeable about the three dimensions of time [past, present and future]. This is the first step of intense nivritti.
 
“samavetA yuyutsavah”
 
“Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra” is “yogamarga” [the “path” of yoga]. If one wants to make [spiritual] war, there has to be [a] “samaveta” (coming together) in this place; meaning: in order for the sadhak to take the delusion of samsara and extinguish it in Self-Knowledge, [the warrior/s] have to come to this place. Just after getting here, the sadhak comes to see that a group of samskaras [tendencies] that are bunched together are attacking him/her, one after another; they are destroying his focus and throwing his attention off somewhere far away. And then again, [he/she sees] that there are some samskaras that are bringing forth steadfastness, enthusiasm and such in his mind/heart, and again bringing the focus back on his/her goal/aim. The first group of samskaras is for associating with worldly things, and the second group is for associating with Sat [spirituality]. It is when the mind becomes deviated that it becomes addicted to worldly matters; and it is [when the mind] becomes acutely observant that it becomes capable of attaining the spiritual things. Therefore, the first group [of samskaras] are the result of “manasik vikar” [deviations of the mind], and for this reason – [there is the statement] “mamakah” [those belonging to me], and the second group [of samskaras] is [the result of] “manasik vichar” [discerning by the mind] (“vi” = “vigata” [gone beyond], “char” = “chala phela” [moving]) – meaning: [those samskaras] are the result of knowledge. It is a state that is like this: it comes about after abandoning resolve and doubt, yet [at the same time] the activities of intellect are [still] in the process of enquiry as well as getting answers, but no real resolution is being established – this kind of state is the state of “manasik vichar.”
 
During the performance of guru-initiated Kriya, the mind [in the broader sense of the word] takes up the subtle nature and thereafter gains breadth. At that time, its contracted state gets destroyed, and therefore, the good and bad samskaras of this and previous lives begin to present themselves. Because [one] is wrapped up in latent desires of worldly matters, the worldly samskaras are much stronger than the samskaras towards Sat. This is why, at first, [those worldly samskaras] destroy his focus and bind up [the sadhak]. But, because of the guru-initiated samskara being ever-awake (Kutastha Chaitanya or Sri Krishna) – through Its Light, the samskaras towards Sat again reappear and make [the sadhak] regain his/her focus towards [the practice]. (This “vishaya-samskara” [samskara towards the world] is “pravritti” [outer-oriented] and “Sat-samskara” is “nivritti” [inner- or Spirit-oriented].) Just as a piece of wood that has been thrown on a river, even though it gets thrown about by both flow and ebb tides because of being under their power, in the end it inevitably ends up in the huge ocean and the tidal currents cannot keep it blocked from going forward – in that same way, if [the sadhak] continuously practices Kriya according to guru's instructions, no matter how powerful the pravritti group is, in the end, for certain and regardless of anything, [the practice] brings [the sadhak] to that Great Ocean of Peace (to the Brahman-Substance). The true-hearted, earnestly endeavoring sadhak is aware of these aspects that thwart and support [manovritti and buddhivritti, respectively]. Because this [activity] appears right before the start of Kriya, it has been said, “If one desires to make war, these [aspects] come together.”
 
“kim kurvata sanjaya”
 
  On the tenth day of the war [in the Mahabharata], Bhishma fell, and when Sanjaya returned from the field of battle to Hastina (to the karmakshetra, where Dhritarashtra, or the mind, resides) to report the news of Bhishma's death, Dhritarashtra began to ask Sanjaya about the war. In the process of describing the war, Sanjaya elucidated the Srikrishnarjunasamvad [dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna] (Gita) to him. The meaning of this is: after crossing the ten-petaled lotus at the Manipur [chakra], when the prana-vayu enters the chitra [nadi], the Kulakundalini [Shakti] awakens. Then the sadhak's body consciousness goes away and the world-oriented “I-ness” - meaning: “chidabhas” [reflected consciousness] or “asmita” [egoism] (that which is spread throughout the ten directions and is continuously protesting against the spirit-hood of the soul/jiva) – becomes powerless. That is what is represented by “the fall of Bhishma.” Upon awakening the Kulakundalini, illuminated by the Tranquil Light of the Self, an internal Eye appears. It is through this [Eye] that collective events of the three dimensions of time [past, present and future] become visible. Later, because of the force of “vikarma” [the trigger to take action], when the sadhak again has to return to the field of action, then, even though he/she has had the direct experience of the Light of the Self, because of still being wrapped up in worldly matters, and as memory is awake, the matters/events that take place from beginning to end in “Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra” begin to, and continue to, appear as shadows in his/her consciousness. Then [the sadhak] goes on to question and enquire about those matters/events. And those enquiries (upon practicing guru-instructed Kriya) become “mimamsita” [resolved by knowing] (directly and experientially). It is this that is expressed in the Gita as the dialogue between Dhritarashtra and Sanjaya. The sadhak's [ordinary] state of consciousness in the waking state is called “Dhritarashtra,” and [the sadhak's] Kriya-attained “manasdrishti” [vision of the inner mind], “antadrishti” [inner vision] or “divyadrishti” [divine sight] is called “Sanjaya.”
 
At the commencement of the performance of Kriya, all of the things that happen/ed, because of pravritti's thwarting and nivritti's endeavoring, until the destruction of the “chidabhas” [reflected consciousness] – remembering those things in detail, or going through them in the mind, is the sadhak's intention. “What did I do after this,” “what did I do after that” - when one thinks and remembers self-created things of the past, these types of questions that rise in the mind – these [questions asked at the beginning of Kriya] are also simple questions like those. Thus: why Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya questions – there is no reason to have any confusion/doubt about that matter.
"
2,"Sanjaya said, “Seeing the soldiers of the Pandava side in battle array, king Duryodhana then went to Dronacharya and spoke thusly.”","“Sanjaya uvacha” [Sanjaya said] = the meaning of this sentence is seen in the commentary of the 21st sloka, [item] (2), and see [as well] the commentary of the 1st sloka of the 2nd Chapter. The way an actor, when acting on stage, takes on different roles with different clothes and make-up, yet he/she remains who he/she always was – in that same way, one person, sometimes taken over by wrong thoughts takes on the forms of lust, anger, greed and such, and then again, when taken over by good thoughts takes on the forms of serenity, self-control, endurance [and such]. In just the same manner as that, the sadhak, while going on the path of sadhana with guru-initiated Kriya, from time to time, sometimes perceives the Gita as Dhritarashtra, sometimes as Sanjaya, sometimes as Duryodhana and that side, and sometimes as Arjuna and Sri Krishna. Therefore, the statements “Dhritarashtra said,” and “Sanjaya said” have to be taken as the aforementioned representations of the various states [of consciousness].
 
King “Duryodhana”: (“Duh” = in sorrow/suffering; “yudh” = to make war; fight + “an”) - Fighting while suffering – meaning: the one with whom fighting is possible with great struggle and effort – that is “Duryodhana.” It is this Duryodhana that is the “kAmarupaṃ durAsadaṃ” [desire in formidable form] in the third chapter. Thus, desire, or the desire for worldly wants is called “Duryodhana.” It is also called “abhimaan” [egotism; self-importance]. This desire is prime in the group of manovritti, and [it is] the most powerful, for which reason it is known as the eldest son [in Indian culture, the eldest son is thought to preside over the clan] of Dhritarashtra (mind). And as the mind is put in endless motion because of being under this very aspect's [desire's] power, and because of its [desire's] influence spread out in the whole of the body, it is “king.” This is the sadhak's worldly-desire-bound, ego-centered state.
 
“vyooDhaṃ pANDavAneekaṃ dṛShTvA”
 
The battle-arrayed Pandavas [Arjuna's side] are in the western part of Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra, and they are engaging in battle while facing east and witnessing the sun-sphere. And the Kauravas [Duryodhana's side] are standing in the eastern part and facing the west – meaning: facing worldliness – because of which they are there with the sun behind them.
 
The front part of the body-sheath is called “east”; the back part is called “west”; the right side is called “south”; and the left side is called “north.” It is in the direction of the east within this [body-]sheath that the “Savitrimandal” [sun] can be seen. If one is a sadhak, he/she already knows this. When one arrives at the “path” of sadhana after having attained the “chatushtaya” [quartet] of sadhana [including] detachment, serenity, self-control and such — Begin Footnote. — The sadhana “chatushtaya”[quartet] are: 1) “nityAnityavastuvivekah” [discrimination between the Eternal and the temporal] – meaning: the Eternal Thing is the One Brahman; other than this, everything that exists is temporal [ends] – this knowledge; 2) “ihamutrArthaphalabhoga virAgah” - meaning: the abandoning of the desire for pleasure in this life and heaven in the afterlife. 3) “shamyAdi Shat sampattih” [the six assets such as serenity etc.] - meaning: “shama” [serenity] = control of mind; “dama” [self-control] = control of the external oriented senses such as the eyes etc.; “titiksha” [forbearance/endurance] = tolerance of the sufferings of cold and heat, pleasure and pain and such; “uparati” [austerity] = the practice of one's true dharma [acting according to one's true nature]; “shraddha” [reverence] = faith in the teachings of guru; “samadhan” [resolve] = one-pointed consciousness; [and] 4) “mumukshatvaṃ” [spiritual longing] – meaning: “O Lord! Let me be Liberated!” - this determined desire. — End Footnote. — – meaning: upon witnessing the Light of the [inner] Sun in the “eastern” direction, the ego-bound [vrittis] stand in front of the vrittis supporting the path of Sat, and try to turn the sadhak away [from the direction of Sat]. Thus, the team of discrimination, detachment [and such] are east-facing and the ego-bound team of great delusions are west-facing. This fight while directly facing each other – this is verily the “sadhana-battle.” The name of this sadhana-battle is “Kriya.”

It is at the start of Kriya that the sadhana-supportive and nivritti-sided group of vrittis such as serenity and self-control etc. become visible on the screen of desirousness; it is this that [is stated as] the “witnessing of the Pandava-soldiers by Duryodhana.”
 
 
“AchAryamupasangamya”
 
The “acharya” [teacher] is Drona. [Although] he was born in the brahmin caste, he took up the life-path of kshatriyas, and gave instructions on the martial arts to both Kurus and Pandavas. [It is like] the way that a crow sees only through one eye at a time; even though it has two eyes it cannot see completely through both eyes at the same time. In the same way, this person [Drona], even though he was guru to both sides, took one of the sides as his own. This Drona is what is known as “samskaric buddhi” [thinking based on latent impressions or samskaras]. Every act, whether good or bad, becomes mutated to samskaras [inner impressions with active power]; therefore, whatever kind of thinking that [eventually] forms [as a samskara] from an action, whether good or bad, has the jiva expressing itself in either of those directions [of good or bad]. Thus, he [Drona] is guru to two sides: to persons of worldly ways and those who desire liberation. Although this [type of] thinking flows in all directions, because of not being scrubbed – meaning: because of not being purified – it remains bound to samsara alone. Even if it looks towards detachment, it cannot act according to that direction. This is the very reason for Drona being aligned with the Kaurava side. At the beginning of Kriya, the vritti represented by Duryodhana, upon becoming aware of the vrittis represented by the Pandavas, tries to make sure that the “samskaric buddhi” [see above] is strengthened towards giving sustenance to the feelings of samsara, and that the samskaric buddhi does not become a giver of sustenance to [the feelings of] detachment. This is the meaning behind “[Duryodhana] going to the teacher – Drona.”
 
“vachanaṃ abraveet”
 
Speaking statements of wisdom that would require many words in a succinct yet heart-captivating way is called “vachana.” (See the essential meaning of this in the commentary to the 1st sloka.) That is what is spoken about in the next nine slokas."
3,"O teacher of the sons of Pandu! Please observe the huge group of soldiers of the Pandava side, who are dressed in battle gear and have been readied for war by Dhrishtadyumna.","The son of Drupada – Dhrishtadyumna – [represents] the Light of Consciousness. All of the vrittis belonging to the group of discrimination, detachment and such – they all turn towards Consciousness/Spirit at the time of sadhana. And it is the assistance of the Light of Consciousness/Spirit's power that gives birth to discrimination [between sat and asat]. This is why it is described thusly: “The sadhana-supporting vrittis have been 'dressed' [for sadhana-battle] by Dhrishtadyumna or the Light of Consciousness/Spirit.”
 
At the end of sadhana, as perfection is attained, the state of samadhi and equipoise comes into being. At that time, the [power of the] Light of Consciousness/Spirit is no longer needed to keep discrimination and detachment [and such vrittis] alive. At that time, those [vrittis] merge/end [in Spirit] automatically and on their own, due to “karmaphala” [fruit of the act – in this case sadhana is the “act”]. That is what is called “the killing of Dhrishtadyumna by Ashvatthama.”
 
Historically, Dhrishtadyumna is the son of Drupada who emerged [fully grown] out of the sacrificial fire from the yajna [fire rite] being conducted [by Drupada] to bring forth a son who would kill Drona. But Drona was [practically] invincible. He had received a boon that unless the seven “talu[s]” [palates] were pierced, he could not be killed. That is why in the fifteenth day of the war of Kurukshetra, when Yudhishthira, acting on the advice of Sri Krishna, said to Dronacharya the words, “Ashvatthama is dead, meaning the elephant,” — Translators Note — In the Mahabharata, Ashvatthama is the name of Dronacharya's mighty warrior-son. Because of Drona's near-invincibility [see main text above], trickery is employed in order to kill him in the war of Kurukshetra. The killing of an elephant, also named “Ashvatthama,” is part of that plot. Drona never hears the last part of Yudhishthira's statement for reasons that are stated differently in different versions of the Mahabharata [one version says that the noise of the military music rises, as instructed by Sri Krishna, right after the first part of the sentence is said]. And, Drona, not understanding that it is an elephant that has been killed, believes that it is his son who has died as he only hears, “Ashvatthama is dead.” That is the cause of Drona's sitting down and weeping. The rest of the story is beyond the scope of this translation and can be found in the Maharabharata itself. — End Translator’s Note —  Dronacharya became overcome with emotion, and [sitting down cross-legged,] put his right foot on the left foot, and on top of that he stood his bow vertically where on the upper end [of the standing bow] he put his palms and then he put his chin on top of his palms, and in that position, he started weeping. The flow of tears streamed down the bowstring. Through the Maya of Sri Krishna, Arjuna thought that the stream of tears was a snake, and, acting on the advice of Sri Krishna, shot off an arrow in order to kill that snake. Because of that, the bowstring [of Drona's bow] was cut [by Arjuna's arrow] and [Drona's] bow sprung straight up. And because of this, the two feet, the two palms of the two hands, the chin, the palate in the mouth, and the Brahmatalu [a center in the head] – these seven “palates” became pierced [by the straightened bow]. At that time, Dhrishtadyumna took a scimitar and cut off Drona's head. Because of this act, the karmic result came in the form of Ashvatthama [the son of Drona and not the elephant], who, during his brutal and murderous attack [of the Pandavas' camp] in the night, killed Dhrishtadyumna while he was asleep.

"04,05,06","For the [upcoming] battle, master archers and warriors equal to Bhima and Arjuna are amongst these soldiers [of the Pandava side]. See there: Yuyudhan, Virat, the great warrior Drupada, Dhrishtaketu, Chekitan, the valorous king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, Shaibya – one of the greatest among men, the strong Yudhamanyu, the heroic Uttamauja, the son of Saubhadra and the sons of Draupadi are present. All of these [personages] are great warriors.","The spiritual meanings of these names are as follows: 1) Yuyudhan = reverence. Historically, he is the son of Satyaka of the Yadu clan and thus known famously as “Satyaki.” He is capable of fighting alone against innumerable opposing soldiers. During the war of Kurukshetra, upon getting help from Arjuna, [Yuyudhan] killed Bhurishrava, the son of Somadatta. 2) Virat = samadhi (“vi” = gone beyond, “rat” = kingdom). One who gives his kingdom to another to run and remains always aloof/distanced – it is he who is Virat. Historically, he is the ruler of the land of Matsya. It is in his home in which the Pandavas spent their incognito period [during their exile]. He used to hand over the running of his kingdom to his own brother-in-law Kichak and remained always at peace. In the fifteenth day of the war of Kurukshetra, he died at the hands of Dronacharya. 3) Drupada = (“dru” = quick; “pad” = going) the force-power of the omnipresent knowingness within, the electrical power, or the intense and dense force. Historically, he is the ruler of the land of Panchala. Another name for him is “Yajnasena.” Because of being humiliated by Drona, he performed a yajna [fire rite] to get a son who would be capable of killing Drona. From a flame of the fire of that yajna, a dark-skinned daughter came into being. It is she who is Draupadi, the daughter of Drupada. And from the womb of the fire of the yajna, a son came into being. It is this being that is Dhrishtadyumna, the son of Drupada. 4) Dhrishtaketu = control; “dhṛShTAni” [steadiness] = “saṃyatAni” [concentrated together]; “ketanAni” [abode] = “sthAnAni” [place] yasya sah [together is that]. The state in which the places come together – meaning: the Kriya of all six chakras come together. Historically, he is the son of the Chedi king, Shishupal. After Shishupal was killed, the Pandavas asked this man to take on the royal duties. In the war of Kurukshetra, he took the side of the Pandavas and, on the fourteenth day of the war, died at the hands of Dronacharya. 5) Chekitan = remembrance. The word “chiki” refers to crickets. The word “tan” refers to “sound.” This offspring of “chiki” is “cheki” - meaning: the sounds of crickets – that which can be heard by sadhaks after beginning sadhana, before the arising of the Anahata Naad [unstruck sound]. Even very young child-sadhaks [or: novice sadhaks] know about this. 6) Kashiraj = Prajna [inner knowing]; the great revelatory power. He is the king of the city of Kashi. 7) Purujit = pratyahar [yogic withdrawal]; a little rest. 8) Kuntibhoja = asana [seated posture]; “kun” = cultivating. 9) Shaibya = niyama [discipline]; the blessing-bestowing power. 10) Yudhamanyu = pranayam; one whose anger rises up upon just hearing about war. 11) Uttamauja = valorousness/powerfulness [or: potent seed]. 12) Saubhadra = samyama, the coming together and unification of dharana [concentration], dhyan [meditation] and samadhi. 13) Draupadeya [children of Draupadi] = the five bindus, the five types of expressions of the five primal elements.
 
In the Samadhipada of Patanjal Darshan [Yoga Sutras of Patanjali], it is stated: “shraddhAveerya smṛtisamAdhi prajnApurvakaṃitareShAṃ” - meaning: just as the yoga [path of connection] of bhogis, whose minds are absorbed in worldly things of the non-Self, is “bhavapratyaya” [Maya-entrapment-conducive] – meaning: because [those things] are rooted in ignorance, they are the cause of birth and death – in the same way, “itareshAṃ” (for the “others” - meaning: the yoga of those who long for the Divine) are “upAyapratya” [empowerment/pathway -conducive] – meaning: one after another, the five [empowerments] such as reverence, valor etc. come forth as pathways [for freedom]. And “teevrasamvegAnAmAsannah” - meaning: those whose concentrated inner force is intense, they attain perfection (samadhi) through yoga very quickly. As well, it has been said in the Sadhanapada of the same scripture: “yama-niyama-Asana-prANAyAma-pratyAhAra-dhAraNA-dhyAnA-samAdhayohaShTAvangAni” - meaning: there are eight limbs [parts] in yoga such as yama [don'ts], niyama [do's] etc.
 
Those five empowerments/pathways, eight limbs and the intense concentrated inner force, [all of] which are part of yoga – they all have been addressed via the aforementioned names [of the soldiers of the Pandava side]. They are enemies of Duryodhana, who represents the desires of the world. That is why at the start of the war they have appeared in the desire-screen of Duryodhana's chitta. And wanting to destroy them, Duryodhana is calling Dronacharya's (samskaric intellect's) attention to them."
7,"O most superior of the twice-born! Those who have primacy among our group, and the director of my soldiers – [now] know them. I am telling you their names so that you may know.","Dronacharya is being addressed as “dvijottama” [most superior of the twice-born] as he is “dvija” [twice-born] because he is the thinking that has come about due to samskaras. “JanmanA jAyate shudrah saṃskArAdvija ucchyate” [at birth, one is a shudra [lowest of the four castes]; by attaining attributes one becomes a dvija [twice-born; or: of an upper caste]]; “vedapAThee bhavedvipro brahma jAnAti brahma jAnAti brAhmaNah” [one who studies the Vedas is a “vipra” and the one who knows Brahman is a brahmin].
 
Being a brahmin and knowing the four Vedas, and [at the same time] taking up the path of Kshatriyas and becoming a master of the martial arts [reflects] the superior nature of Drona. The samskaric intellect does both: it enjoys the Bliss of Brahman and, at the same time, bound by samskaras [of the person and the culture], it is ready to protect the sacredness of knowledge and destroy its corruption/corruptors. This is why this intellect is superior.
 
Drona became the disciple of Parashurama and learned all of the martial arts, and later, as a master of martial arts, became the military-guru of both of the Kuru and Pandava sides. “Kuru” means “karma,” or the path of “bhoga” [worldly partaking], and “Pandava” means “jnana” [knowledge], or the path of “yoga.”  -7-
 
The human being's thinking is carried out due to two types of samskaras: 1) the karma-samskaras remaining at the time of death in the previous life/lives – meaning: by “daiva” [subtle currents of fate due to actions in past lives], or [what is also called] “prarabdha karma” [karma accumulated from previous lives], and 2) the karma-samskaras of this life intended to attain “dvija” [a higher standing] – meaning: by the “purushkara[s] karma” [acts that bring about uplifting samskaras through self-effort]. In the way that a gramophone disc is restricted to [playing or sounding] that which is recorded [on it], or the music that has been “written” upon it – in that same way, the human body is bound to the daiva or prarabdha karmas as if they are written upon it. The human being is bound to act according to those [samskaras born of those karmas]. The pleasures and pains that are written in the human being's book of fate – he/she has to experience that. Without experiencing them they do not diminish [or: end]. This very thing is [the human being's] “bhoga” [partaking]. And [conversely,] with the karma-samskaras that help one attain “dvijatva” [being twice-born; or: a higher station in consciousness than at birth], [meaning] the purushkaras, one's mind – independently [regardless of prarabdha] – endeavors towards the attainment of the Knowledge of the Self, and goes on progressing towards the abode of Knowledge. This is one's yoga. During this progression, even if predestined fate blocks [the sadhak] and keeps him stuck to the prarabdha karma that is surrounding him/her with delusion, because of the fruits attained through purushkaras and reaching the state of “dvija,” one's attention remains locked in the direction of spiritual Knowledge; it [the drive for Knowledge] does not get lost. Eventually, that [drive for Knowledge] becomes extremely intense and becomes directed towards the annihilation of [the sadhak's] prarabdha.  That is why, historically, Drona – representing the samskaric intellect – even though he was bound by the delusion caused by the powers of previous daiva samskaras or prarabdha karma and took the side of the Kauravas, or was bound to bhoga – because of the samskaras of his being “twice-born,” due to the fruit of his purushkaras, his attention remained steadily in the direction of the Panadava side – or the side of yoga. Because of this reason, his body, which is the manifestation of the prarabdha karma samskaras, came to its destruction via the knowledge attained from his purushkaras – meaning: in the hands of two disciples named Arjuna and Dhrishtadyumna. Arjuna, cut the “delusion-bowstring” (gunas) of Drona's “body-bow,” via his “arrow” – meaning: discrimination – by which [Drona's] seven palates were pierced, and right after that, Dhrishtadyumna, with his “scimitar,” or Knowledge, decapitated [Drona]."
"08,09","Our Bhishma, Karna, [along with] Kripa – who is victorious in war, Ashvatthama, Vikarna, Saumadatti, Jayadratha and other heroic ones in great numbers are also present; all of whom are ready to die for me. [There are] many kinds of warriors [present] who are highly skilled in war, wielding weapons of missile types and [weapons for] close range fighting.","The spiritual meanings of these names are as follows: 1) Bhavan = Drona. One whose vision is only through one eye, even though he has two [functioning] eyes. One who, when he sees one perspective, cannot see in another way – like a crow. This means: the [type of] intellect that is bound by samskaras. (Although being able to see all sides, yet looking towards the direction of only one side – this intellect is not pure.) The intellect that wants to look only towards Brahman – only that [intellect] is pure. This is why Pandu is the pure intellect, exemplified by Pandu's abandoning the partaking of the worldly things of his kingdom and his exclusive endeavor of worshiping God. [But] this pure intellect is a bondage to the jiva as well. That is why, in order to extinguish this [bondage of pure intellect], the sadhak has to engage in a little bit of [spiritual] addiction. Just as soon as this [spiritual] addiction rises up, the pure intellect immediately disappears. This is the meaning of “Pandu's death being caused by becoming attached to Madri.” 2) Bhishma = Abhas Chaitanya [reflected consciousness], or “Asmita” [egoism]. This means: the ego/I-ness from ignorance. 3) Karna = duty-bound/obligatory work, or passion. 4) Kripa = imagining, or ignorance. Thinking of the Eternal, the pure, happiness and self-ness ([this time erroneously as] me and mine) superimposed on the impermanent, impure, sorrow and substances of non-self-ness is called “Avidya” [ignorance]. Thus, Avidya's aim is the eternal, the pure, and the Self-substance. Due to delusion or erroneous perception, it thinks that the impermanent and such are [actually] the eternal and such. If that confusion is dispelled, it can ascertain the impermanent as impermanent, and then it abandons the impermanent and grasps onto the Eternal. Then that ignorance or confusion in Avidya  becomes transformed to Knowledge. That Knowledge is never destroyed. That is why, according to history, Kripa took the side of the Kauravas, or the path of “bhoga” [external enjoyments], due to being under the power of delusion. But at the end of the war, as the bhogas were finished, his delusion was dispelled, and he went over to the side of the Pandavas, or the path of “yoga” [spirituality]. Yudhishthira engaged him as the martial arts guru of Parikshit. [Kripa] became one of the seven immortals. 5) Ashvatthama = the conglomerate of the quartet of fieriness, control, lust and anger, or “karmaphala” [the fruits of actions]. One person's karmic fruits have to be suffered by two or three generations,  particularly the good and bad of the grandfather – it goes to the grandson. The meaning of “the effort by Ashvatthama to kill Parikshit” is this. This is the torrent of the endless fruits of karma taking place in samsara. In the path of pravritti, there is no end to that torrent. That is why Ashvatthama is one of the immortals.
 
“ashvatthama baleervyasa hanumanta vibheeShaNah
kṛpah parashurAmashcha saptaite chirajeevinah”
 
[Ashvatthama, Bali, Vyasa, Hanuman, Vibhishan, Kripa and Parashurama are the seven immortals]
 
6) Vikarna = undutiful/useless work, or hatred/repulsion. He is a close brother of Duryodhana. 7) Saumadatti (Bhurishrava: bhuri shravati yah sah [one who listens to words about things that fill up]) = karma or samsara. The vritti [active aspect of general consciousness] that, because of being under the power of desires, goes on listening continuously to words of worldly partakings and does not let the mind be concentrated. That is Bhurishrava. Right upon sitting down for sadhana, the sadhak sees so many long-forgotten things of the past, and so many types of endeavors come to his/her mind. That is the work of this vritti. 8) Jayadhratha = clinging to bodily life, or fear of death. Historically, he is the husband of Duryodhana's sister, and is the king of the land of Sindhu. Because he had abducted Draupadi, he was humiliated by the Pandavas [after he was defeated and captured]. That is why he worshiped Mahadeva [Lord Shiva] in order to get a boon to defeat the Pandavas [in the war to come later]. However, the Lord Mahadeva gave his boon with the condition that he would be able to defeat everyone with the exception of Arjuna. That is why, Arjuna, being unafraid of death, was able to kill him.
 
“avidyAsmitA rAga dveshAbhiniveshah kleshAh – iti patanjal”
[“Kleshas” [afflictions] are: ignorance, egotism, attachment, hatred and clinging to bodily life. So it is said in [the Yoga Sutras of] Patanjali.]
 
These five “kleshas” [afflictions] are nurturers in the path of pravritti and obstacles in the path of sadhana. Those pravritti-sided vrittis that come up during sadhana have been represented by Bhishma and such. In order to make His Lila [Divine Play] be robust, the Supreme Lord created these vrittis – in the form of Yuyudhan and such – as obstacles in the practice of sadhana; and adding more impediments to sadhana, He made the kleshas the most senior, [as represented] in the forms of Bhishma, Drona and such. 9) “Anye cha bahavAh shurA” [other brave warriors] = Shalya, Kritavarma and such. Shalya = thorn, or dart/spear – if such a thing is present, there is the experience of continuous affliction. Whether the karma-samskaras [automatic tendencies – which are born from actions – to behave, think and feel in particular ways] are good or bad, they are the cause of the jiva's bondage. Thus, Shalya represents the jiva's samskaric actions. As “he” is eventually extinguished in the space/ether-element through the practice of Kriyayoga – that is what is [expressed as] the killing of Shalya by Yudhishthira as written in the Mahabharata. Kritavarma = the love for one's body; the effort to save/protect the body. “YuddhavishAradah” [masters of war] – all of those vrittis, which are like thorns to doing good works [or: spiritual practice], are able to keep the jiva locked in the path of samsara – meaning: as long as they exist, Release or Liberation does not come about for the jiva."
10,"Our soldiers, guarded by Bhishma, are “aparyapta” [beyond [merely being] sufficient, but the soldiers of the Pandavas, guarded by Bhima, are “paryapta” [[merely] sufficient].","The essential meaning from the 3rd to the 10th sloka: Dhristadyumna is Drona's disciple – the meaning of this is: the Light of Consciousness actually revealed via buddhi [intelligence/intellect]. But as soon as the Light of Consciousness is revealed, it tries to extinguish buddhi, which is when active desires rise up in the sadhak's mind to excite the buddhi into relating to worldly matters, and the active desires [Duryodhana] seem to go on to say, “O buddhi! That which you love, and that which is growing because of you, that very Light of Consciousness is ready to destroy you. Do not give it any more of your attention. Destroy it quickly. All of the vrittis – Yuyudhan and such – that are revealed by that Light of Consciousness are all great warriors (whichever [vritti] the mind puts it attention on – that very [vritti] has the power of pulling the mind into a stupor of desire) – meaning: quick and powerful; what to say – they are even as powerful as wind and fire. Therefore, all of them [Pandavas] are nothing at all. Compared to us, they are all insignificant, because on our side – because you are there along with Bhishma, Karna and such, we have the powers of both kshatriyas and brahmins. But for them (in their side) – because they only have the power of kshatriyas, they have no [real] power. Not only that – our side is [nearly] unlimited in quantity. And Bhishma, the one who is the Abhas Chaitanya, the one, let us just say, who almost has no death or extinguishing – it is he who is the protector. And their side is limited [and] very small compared to ours. And their protector is Bhima – meaning: [the element] air, which is ever restless and whose force/power is inconsistent.”
 
But because Bhishma had called Karna “half-a-warrior,” Karna (obligatory/duty-bound actions), filled with anger, vowed that he would not take up weapons as long as Bhishma was fighting in the war. So, with the possibility of obligatory/duty-bound actions being absent from the “war,” there is a reason for Duryodhana to have some fear as well. For this reason, in the next sloka [Duryodhana] tries to arrange for the protection of Bhishma."
11,"All of you stand at every entrance point of the military formation according to your particular station and, particularly, protect Bhishma.","The meaning of saying “particularly protect Bhishma” is this: as long as the Chidabhas [reflected consciousness] – meaning: the love for the “I am the body” idea, or egoism, stays alive, even thousands and thousands of teachings on the Knowledge of Brahman can in no way and in no time destroy the mesh of the net of desires. “SarveShu ayaneShu” - the six chakras, such as the Muladhar etc., comprise the “road” - meaning: the “path” of yoga. Both of the pravritti and nivritti sides are in every chakra.
As:

Muladhar is on Pandava Side as, earth (Sahadeva) – security, serenity, and on the Kaurava Side as, desire/lust (Duryodhana).

Svadhisthan is on Pandava Side as, water (Nakul), and on the Kaurava Side as, anger (Duhshasana) and the fear of death (Jayadratha)  - they are considered as being together because they support each other.

Manipur is on Pandava Side as, fire/energy (Arjun) - forbearance/endurance, and on the Kaurava Side as, greed (Karna = obligatory/duty-bound actions and Vikarna = unnecessary/undutiful actions).

Anahata is on Pandava Side as, air (Bhima) – satiety, and on the Kaurava Side as, delusion (Shakuni – it is he who brought about delusion and made the Kaurava side become engaged in the dice game).

Vishuddha is on Pandava Side as, ether/space (Yudhishthira) - reverence, and on the Kaurava Side as, arrogance (Shala, the king of Madra).

Ajna is on Pandava Side as, Kutastha Chaitanya (Sri Krishna) - Resolution, and on the Kaurava Side as, miserliness, or avarice, or envy (Bhishma, Drona and Kripa).

Ashvatthama = fruits of actions.
(Note -- This was in table format in the original)

For every jiva, friends such as serenity and enemies such as lust come forth because of the results of actions. That is why Ashvatthama [representing fruits of actions] is present in all six of the locations."
12,"Then the mighty Kuru elder and grandfather Bhishma roared loudly like a lion and sounded his conch-shell [like a horn], giving rise to joy in him (Duryodhana).","When bad luck falls, even humorous words can become insulting. Duryodhana, after inflaming anger in his guru against the Pandavas, desired his own benefit and ended up saying this insulting statement: “the teacher of the sons of Pandu” [referring to Drona]. The guru was a little hurt emotionally [by this statement]. The guru thought, “Duryodhana gives me money; that is why today he called me 'the teacher of the sons of Pandu'; he did not admit that I am his guru [as well]. Besides, he even showed his lordship over me.” Thinking this, out of contempt, [Drona] decided not to respond to Duryodhana's [other more] entreating words. Bhishma, realizing the teacher's contempt, roared like a lion and sounded his conch-shell [in order to instill confidence in the Kaurava side].
 
When the vrittis of bhoga-desires are strong, at that time, [the wisdom of] the impermanence and the limitedness of the fruits of bhoga [enjoyments] find no place in the mind. Although at that time all of the positives and negatives of satisfying the desires for pleasure do arise in the mind once in a while, but because of the power of wanting, there is restlessness; thus the intellect does not work properly. The intellect is not really at play [in this situation]; only the endeavors of the “I-ness” or “ahamkar” [ego] take place. That is what is stated here sequentially as the unresponsiveness of Dronacharya, and the lion's roar and sounding of the conch-shell by Bhishma.
 
“The lion's roar”; “conch-shell”: In the early stages of sadhana, when vital air begins to have stops due to the practice of a certain Kriya, then, because of the effects of not enough practice and being bound to the power of desires and due to the pushing power of the air, the sadhak is forced to expel the retained air. And in order to get quick relief from the torment of that retention of air, [the sadhak] exhales a long breath in such a forceful manner that it sounds like a lion's roar within [the body]. And right along with that another sound rises (that sound can be heard even with little practice). It's resonance is heavy and somber. That is the conch-shell sound of Bhishma. Because of that breath going out forcefully, the body feels good. And because the sound is pleasant to hear, there is quite a joyful feeling that comes about. Because of that, the vrittis of desires become excited and alive, as there is the feeling that there is again a chance to enjoy the external worldly pleasures. This is what is spoken of as Duryodhana's joy. As one goes [concentrates] to listen to that sound which is pleasant to hear, a little later – because of the pressure of air – [the sounds] change into a mixed-up, confused and unclear kind of noise. That is why it is called “tumul” [tumultous] (that is spoken about later).
 
That the [person referred to as] “kuruvṛddhah pitAmahah” [elder of the Kurus, the grandfather] is Bhishma – the reason for that [identification] can be understood easily if the Kuru [Kauravas] family lineage written below is read with the meanings according to yoga shastras.

(Note — See actual book for figure.)

Shantanu = The Immutable Brahman-Consciousness. Ganga [Ganges] = Consciousness as Manifestation. Bhishma = reflected consciousness. (Ganga gave birth to eight children. Those are the Ashtavasu [a certain group of eight supernatural beings]. The eighth one's name was “Prabhas”  - [meaning:] egoism or Bhishma.  Satyavati = Material Nature. Vedavyas = incisive knowledge (offspring of the rishi Parashara). 
 
In the Pandava Lineage there is — 
Chitrangada = primal creative substance
Ambika = the vritti of doubt
Pandu = pure intellect (he is neuter, even though his manifestation [as a person] is male)
Kunti = power of nivritti
Madri = addiction in nivritti (renouncing)
Yudhishthira = space-element (attribute of sound)
Bhima = air-element (attributes of sound and touch)
Arjuna = fire/energy-element (attributes of sound, touch and sight)
Nakula = water/liquid-element (attributes of sound, touch, sight and taste)
Sahadeva = earth-element (attributes of sound, touch, sight, taste and smell)
Draupadi = Kulakundalini
Subhadra = power of great beneficence
Abhimanyu = samyama – meaning: dharana [concentration], dhyan [meditation] and samadhi coming together as one


In the Dhritarashtra lineage there is — 
Vichitravirya = primal ego
Ambalika = the vritti of certainty
Dhritarashtra = mind (blind)
Gandhari = power of pravritti
Vaishya = addiction in pravritti (grasping)
Duryodhana and such = lust, greed and such
Yuyutsu = the desire for war (he, with his soldiers, had taken the side of the Pandavas at the beginning of the war)
"
13,"After that, the sounds from “shankha” [conch-shell], “bheri” [kettle-drum], “panava” [small drum or cymbal], “aanaka” [drum], “gomukha” [a wind instrument from a shell] and such sounded out together. That sound grew to a tumultuous level. ","When the sadhak gets to this state, because of vital air entering the gates of the openings in the nadis in his/her body, many types of sounds arise. It is like when horns, kettle-drums, large drums, barrel drums, cymbals, and flutes sound together and create a feeling of a disturbing chaos; these sounds are also like that. Like hearing the chaotic sounds of a marketplace from quite a distance – it is like that."
14,"After that, “Madhava” (Sri Krishna) and Pandava (Arjuna), seated in a great chariot pulled by four white horses, sounded two celestial conch-shells.","Even though the sadhak has to come down due to the vrittis [movements in consciousness] of desires (pravritti), the vrittis directed to the Self (nivritti) rise in the heart/mind and again have [the sadhak] turn upwards. Then [the sadhak] gathers in his outward-directed tendencies, enters within and becomes locked in a location quite high up. That is what is called the “mahati syandana” or the high chariot. At that time, [the sadhak] can see a white light, which, right away seems to break up into four pieces and moves to the right, left, upwards and downwards – like lightning. Those are the “white horses.” After that light, [the sadhak] sees (in the heart) an indivisible spherical substance that is deep and dark. That is verily “Madhava” [“Ma” = Lakshmi – the Great Shakti with sattva guna (revelatory light) + “dhava” = husband (Krishna); the meaning is: the Being in Whose lap the Great Space is being revealed – it is He Who is “Madhava.”].8 Finally, after this dark sphere, a very bright, [yet] deeply dark bindu [spot] is seen. That bindu is “Pandava” (Arjuna). Going on looking at that, the mind becomes still, immediately upon which a sky-pervading sound comes forth. How that sound is, and the kind of a place from which it arises – that is being explained in the next group of slokas."
"15,16,17,18","“Hrishikesh” [Sri Krishna] [sounded] the “Panchajanya” conch-shell; “Dhananjaya” [Arjuna] [sounded] the “Devadatta” conch-shell; “Bheemakarma Vrikodara” [Bhima] [sounded] the conch-shell named “Paundra”; king Yudhishthira – the son of Kunti – [sounded] the “Anantavijaya” conch-shell; Nakula [sounded] the “Sughosha” conch-shell, and Sahadeva sounded the conch-shell named “Manipushpaka.” The great archer Kashiraj, the great warriors Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virat, the undefeatable Satyaki, Drupada, the sons of Draupadi and the mighty ones such as Subhadra all sounded their own separate conch-shells.","“Hṛsheekeshah”:  “hṛsheekA” = the aggregate of the senses; “eesha” = controller/director; the One Who is the controller/director of the senses. The One by Whose Power the senses do their own particular works – it is He Who is Hrishikesh (Sri Krishna) – Kutastha Chaitanya. His abode is the Ajna-chakra. From the five chakras such as Muladhar etc., five sounds arise, and they are experienced as mixed together and coming from within the Ajna-chakra. This is why Sri Krishna's conch-shell is called “Panchajanya” [from five sources].
 
“Dhananjaya”: “dhana” = experiential manifestations (birth, death, pleasure, pain, hunger, thirst [etc.]); “jaya” = being victorious. The one who is victorious over the experiential manifestations is “Dhananjaya.” It is by the element of fire/energy that the kinetic power becomes evident; air also moves due to fire/energy; thus, whatever powers there are [in phenomena], they happen due to fire/energy. This is why the name of the fire-element is called “Dhananjaya.” His abode is at the Manipur-chakra. At that place, he [also] takes the name of “Vaishvanara” [universal person] and bestows the jiva its life-sustaining power (the nectar in the form the digestive juices). This Vaishvanara is the actual face of all of the gods [alternate translation: This Vaishvanara is the primary form of all of the gods.]. This is why, during sadhana, the sound that is similar to the veena [Indian lute] that rises from that Manipur – it is named “Devadatta” conch-shell resonance [resonance “from the gods”], the vritti of experiencing, or “Sananda Samprajnata Samadhi.”

“Vṛkodara” - (“vṛka” = fire; “udara” = belly; because there is a fire named “vrika” in the belly, Bhima's name is “Vrikodara”) - the air-element. Fire comes from air and again dissolves into air. Therefore it can be said that fire exists within air [within its “belly”]. For this reason, the air element is called “Vrikodara.” The location of [the] air-element is the Anahata-chakra situated in the heart-center. During sadhana, a sound like long-sustaining bells rises from here. Its name is “Paundra” conch-shell resonance, the “ahamkar [ego] vritti” or the “Sasmita Samprajnata Samadhi” state.
 
“MahAshankha” - “nṛlalATAsthikhandena rachitA japamAlikA; mahAshankhamayee jneyA mahAvidyA susiddhidA” - (Neelatantra) – meaning: above the Ajna-chakra, in the “dashangula” [ten-finger-length] place (right after the skeletal-section of the forehead, within the head [but] outside the brain-matter), there is a skeletal-section with 51 small openings/holes. It is that which is called “Mahashankha” [great conch-shell]. The central opening in this [skeletal-section] is called “Sumeru.” All of the places in the body are “ahata” [struck]; only that ten-finger-length area is “anahata” [unstruck]. During sadhana, when vital air pierces through that Sumeru and goes to the Sahasrar – it is then that the sound like long-sustaining bells - [which is] not fluttering/fluctuating – the resonance of the Mahashankha – is heard. That is the conch-shell sound of Bhima.
 
“YudhiShThira” - (one who cannot be moved in war) = the space-element. Space is always still. Regardless of the strong forces of earth, water, fire and air, there is no movement in space. This is why the space-element is called “Yudhishthira.” Its location is in the Vishuddha-chakra in the throat. During sadhana, a sound like thunder rises from here. That is what is called “Anantavijaya” [eternally victorious] conch-shell resonance, because no other sound can overtake this sound. When mind is merged into this sound, the state devoid of all vrittis - “Asamprajnata Samadhi”  - comes about.
 
“Nakula” = the “rasa” [liquid/water/taste] element. With all of the kinds of “rasas” [tastes/enjoyments represented by the “water-element”] that there are – one cannot finish them through partaking – meaning: one cannot find the shore (the boundary) of the water-element [no end to partaking in worldly enjoyments]. For this reason the water-element is named “Nakula.” It is located in the Svadhisthan-chakra at the root of the sex organ. From here, a sound similar to a flute rises forth. It is called “Sughosha” conch-shell resonance, the vritti of certainty, or the state of “Savichara Samprajnata Samadhi.”
 
“Sahadeva” - the earth-element (“Saha” = that which is “with”; “deva” = one who sports). The sport of the jiva is with the Earth – meaning: [the aspects that are] within the five elements – sound, touch, sight, taste, smell – it is with these guna-connected primal particles of the Earth that the jiva has a close relationship. It is for this very reason that the earth-element is called “Sahadeva” [that which is company to the deva]. It is verily because of this close relationship that the vanity of the body (physical) is strong. The Muladhar-chakra is the location of this earth-element. From here, a sound similar to the mad buzzing of bees rises forth. It is that which is called “Manipushpaka” conch-shell resonance, the vritti of doubt, or the state of “Savitarka Samprajnata Samadhi.”
 
The meanings of “Kashiraj,” “Dhrishtadyumna” etc. are stated in slokas 3-6 [of Chapter 1].
 
“Shikhandee” = delusion. The hankering for fulfilling desires or enjoying worldly pleasures after the taking up of yoga. When this hankering grows, the life-force “chimes up.” That is the conch-shell sound of Shikhandi.
 
In his previous life, Shikhandi was “Amba,” the daughter of Kashiraj. More about that and the spiritual mystery behind it are presented below.
 
Kashiraj had three daughters: 1) Amba (the vritti of delusion), 2) Ambika (the vritti of doubt) and 3) Ambalika (the vritti of certainty). During the formal occasion in which they were choosing their husbands, Bhishma forcefully abducted all three sisters right from the very gathering of this occasion, and betrothed both Ambika and Ambalika to his own brother Vichitravirya. Because Amba had already chosen Shalvaraj as her husband, Bhishma sent her to Shalvaraj. But because of the abduction of Amba by Bhishma, Shalva decided to not have Amba [as his wife]. Amba took refuge with Parashurama, who was Bhishma's guru. Even with all of Parashurama's efforts [at reasoning with Bhishma], he was not able to bring Bhishma to think in his way [to take Amba as his wife] . Then Amba, in order to kill Bhishma, prayed to Lord Shiva, and with Shiva's boon left her body and became reborn as the neuter daughter of the king Drupada; and later, through the magical favor of a “yaksha” [nature-spirit], became male. He-she then learned the military-arts and became a powerful warrior. Bhishma-deva, the great hero, the one who is victorious over the senses, was aware of all of these endeavors of Amba. However, [Bhishma's] death was under Bhishma's own power. Unless he wished it, there was no way that death would come to him. His father had given him this boon.
 
In order to kill Bhishma, Shikhandi took the side of the Pandavas during the war of Kurukshetra. On the tenth day of the war, Arjuna, at the advice of Bhishma himself [hinted previously to the Pandavas], fought Bhishma while keeping Shikhandi in front of him [between Arjuna and Bhishma]. Upon seeing the female-neuter Shikhandi, Bhishma put down his weapons. Then he was shot, arrow after arrow, by Arjuna and lay down [supported above the ground by the arrows] on his “deathbed.”

— Begin Translator’s Note — According to the Mahabharata, Bhishma had vowed that he would never fight a woman. Thus, Arjuna using Shikhandi as a shield was the only way to kill Bhishma — End Translator’s Note —

When the shadow of delusion comes about, power is covered up. Because of that the “abhas” (reflection) becomes powerless. That is why with the appearance of delusion in the form of Shikhandi, the reflected consciousness in the form of Bhishma became powerless, and later Shikhandi, because of the fruits of his-her own karma, was killed by Ashvatthama.
 
Indeed, the instruction regarding the practice of Kriya is that it must be performed while looking at Kutastha. It is only by becoming established in the Ajna-chakra that one can be an adept at Knowledge and the functions of Knowledge. This is because the five elements are here in subtle form, and all of the matters of the five elements to be known can be known here. Then again, because the Niranjan Purush [Perfect Person] Who is beyond the elements is also knowable in that same place, [when] associating with That [or: that place] - “prajnAnam brahma” [Consciousness is Brahman], “tat tvam asi” [thou art that], “aham brahmasmi” [I am Brahman], “ayamatmA brahma] – the meaning of these four “Mahavakyas” [iconic great statements] become directly realized; and later, upon being established in Brahman, one becomes a “jivanmukta” [Liberated while alive in the body] and the knowledge “sarvam khalu idaṃ brahma” [indeed, all that is, is Brahman] can be known. During Kriya, while doing continuous Kriya, when the mind becomes settled at Kutastha, a “vayu” [vital air] from below goes up in a whirring way with intense force, and with that happening, a sound also rises forth. That sound is called “naad.” But because of mind becoming still due to attention on the Kutastha, the collision/strike of that vital air (the resonance of the sound) is really experienced first at the Ajna-chakra. Listening to that “naad” with a settled mind, one comes to know that there are several tones united in one rhythm and sounding out like the sound of a self-playing musical instrument. That is what is called the “Panchajanya” conch-shell sound of Hrishikesh [Sri Krishna]. Then through “manas-Kriya” (according to guru's instructions), one has to try to enter into that sound. Right upon making that attempt, because of the collected power of that vital air, there is the appearance of the fire-element situated in the Manipur, and from the middle of that resonance, a powerful light blossoms forth (“dhvanirantargataṃ jyotih” [the light within the sound]), and along with that happening, the sound immediately changes. Then, a sound exactly like a self-sounding veena [Indian lute] begins to resound. That is verily the “Devadatta” conch-shell sound of Arjuna. Immediately upon when one ventures with the mind to enter into that veena-sound, because of the collision/strike of that upward moving vital air, the manifestation of the air-element can be seen. And with that, the sound changes, and a sound similar to long-sustaining bells begins to sound forth. That is verily the resonance by the name of “Paundra” from the “Mahashankha” [great conch-shell] of Bhima. When one puts one's mind in that sound, an intense electric power rises up and takes the mind up to the Vishuddha and pervades it into space. On the outside as well, the body goes through a thrill-rush, and a sound like thunder can be heard. That is verily Yudhishthira's “Anantavijaya” conch-shell resonance. Right as it reaches the Vishuddha, that vital air completely loses its power. Not having the support of the five elements, it cannot rise farther up. Thus, it gradually spreads in the downward direction. As soon as it takes up the downward movement, it goes directly down to, and collides/ strikes (without running into any blocks) at, the Svadhisthan. Right away, a very sweet flute-like sound begins to come forth. That is verily the sounding out of Nakula's “Sughosha” conch-shell. At that time, a boundless bliss-nectar manifests, due to which the mind becomes intoxicated. But that vital air's force, becoming progressively stronger in the downward motion, just touches the Svadhisthan and falls down into the Muladhar. Its force also becomes progressively steadied, and a sound, just like the mad buzzing of bees, rises up. That is what is called Sahadeva's “Manipushpaka” conch-shell resonance. This sound makes the sadhak's mind ecstatic. As is the ecstasy, so is the coming of restlessness. Taking refuge in that restlessness, [the sadhak's mind] exits to the outside. At that time, the sadhak hears a bunch of separate [not the same] sounds, passing like the blinks of the eyes, one after another. The matter of those sounds is mentioned in slokas 17 and 18 [of Chapter 1]. But because of the mind's restlessness, those [sounds] stay only for moments and are not clear, and [thus] are not perceived very well.
 
During Kriya, if the sadhak, who is overwhelmed by the pressures of pravritti and nivritti, looks at Kutastha, gradually he sees many types of colorful forms and hears many types of light and heavy sounds. These are the things that are spoken about in these slokas."
19,That tumultuous sound completely filled the sky and the Earth with its tremendous resonance and the hearts of the side of Dhritarashtra were filled with trepidation.,"When the sadhak goes on listening to all of these sounds, he/she is captivated in astonishment, and thereby becomes drawn in that direction [of the sounds]. From the “earth” (Muladhar) to the “sky” (Vishuddha), all of the places become filled with sound. But because of the active potency of desire being strong in [the sadhak's] mind, and therefore not being able to discern between good and bad, he/she feels that all of those sounds [from the Pandava side] are forewarning danger and [thus the sadhak] tries to get rid of [those sounds]; but he/she is not able to do so. A kind of longing comes about in the heart; it feels like the heart is being devastated. In the progress of sadhana, when the sound first starts to rise up, these types of states come about. All of these things are to be known by oneself [or: through one's own experience]; it cannot be understood through explanation.
 
When there is pressure, if a bad feeling rises in the mind, immediately after that a good feeling naturally comes up; this is true without a doubt. That is why, right after that [aforementioned] “Dhritarashtra-type” of feeling rises, the “Panadava-type” of feeling that is written about in the [following] 20th sloka comes up. But if desire remains strong, even the words of wisdom become eventually filled with ignorance. The words from the 21st sloka [of Chapter 1] onwards exemplify that."
20,"With the innumerable battalions ready to engage [in war], “Kapidhvaja” Arjuna [Arjuna with his banner with the image of Hanuman], upon seeing Dhritarashtra's side ready to fight, raised his bow and spoke these words to Hrishikesh [Sri Krishna].","“Kapidhvaja” - During Kriya, the tongue is turned backwards, and after it goes above the nasal cavity and crosses through the “Shleshma” area, the tip of the tongue has to be leaned and rested a little to the left side (it leans and rests automatically by itself). This is the “Kapidhvaja” state of the sadhak.
 
“Dhanurudyamya” - The spinal column is called “dhanu” [bow]. When one becomes “samaṃ kAyashirogreevaṃ” [body aligned with head and neck – meaning: sitting up straight with the head straight], the spine on one's back becomes a bit bowed [towards the front] in the rear. If the chest is put outwards and the head is held straight up with the chin firmed towards the throat [with the head still being straight; the chin is not pressed against the throat as the head is straight], the spine takes on that kind of form [like a bow]. That is why that type of sitting is called “dhanurudyaman” [bow in a ready position].
 
All of these pravrittis will run to the worldly things as soon as they find the smallest crack [to escape], and, as well [conversely], the nivrittis will take the sadhak in the direction of the Self [when they have the opportunity]. In this way, all of the vrittis remain still. It is this state that has been described as “pravṛtee shastrasampAte” [weapons armed and ready to engage].
 
It is when this state comes about that “Hrishikesh” [Sri Krishna] appears (“hṛSheekA” = the aggregate of the senses; “eesha” = the director/ruler). This means: even though all of the vrittis of the senses are ready to [automatically] carry out their individual activities, the power to rule over them/direct them comes about for the sadhak. At that time, a great wish rises up to see what all is present all around. How that wish is – that is explained in the next few slokas."
"21,22,23","Arjuna said: O Achyuta [the Imperishable/Imperturbable] [Sri Krishna], place my chariot in the middle of the soldiers of both sides. These [persons] who are present here desiring to fight in this war – alongside whom (among them) will I be fighting? Let me have a full view of them. And more, those evil-minded ones in this war who are here for the benefit of Duryodhana – let me see who all of these warriors are as well.","“Arjuna uvAcha” [Arjuna said]: Now the “sreekṛShNArjuna saṃvAd” [dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna; also: a name for the Bhagavad Gita] begins. That is why it is being said “arjuna uvAcha” = Arjuna said. “Arjuna” (“a” + “rajju” [rope] + “na”; see the commentary in the slokas in the 8th Chapter) – one who is not free from bonds. The “bound-by-samsara state” of the jiva is called “Arjuna.” Here, it is actually the sadhak that is being called “Arjuna.” In the sadhana-life of the sadhak, he/she has to experience many different kinds of states/conditions of being; those particular and individual states/conditions have particular and individual names given to them. To understand this Gita – which is the total essence of the scriptures of yoga – generally speaking, there are three states of the sadhak. Those are:
 
The first state is – from having received initiation according to traditional injunctions and having taken up “dvijatva” [the spiritual station in life], beginning at the first stage of Kriya and up to the point of coming to the entrance of the superfine lotus-stem of the subtle path of the sushumna. This state is totally full of restlessness [or: movements in the mind]. This is what is called the sadhak's “child” [or: novice] state. In this state, with the power of guru's grace, an upward pull (meaning: upwardly attracted mind) happens, and as the sadhak goes on doing Kriya, strength is continuously gathered in the heart. Only this much happens [in this state]. It is this state that in the Mahabharata is called “the Pandava's time of living in the forest.”
 
Then – the second state. Vanquishing the strength of the mind's restlessness via the practice of Kriya, and diminishing external awareness [during meditation], [and thus] entering the mind into that subtler than the subtlest path of the sushumna is what is called the second state of the sadhak. At that time – the particular kinds of states that happen to the body, and the particular kinds of feelings/experiences that rise up in the mind, as well as the particular things that can be seen or heard – all of that is what has been called by the name of “Gita” - in the form of “the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna.” In this state, the sadhak is only being referred to as “Arjuna.” The reason is: although there is [still] the bondage of the fruits of the karma because of desires not having been finished, because of being in the practice of Kriya in the rajo-sattva guna, all of the sadhak's actions are pure. (It has also been written in the Mahabharata that the third Pandava was named “Arjuna” because all of his actions were pure.) Even though the sadhak who has attained this state (meaning: arriving at the Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra as described in the 1st sloka [of Chapter 1] is being addressed only as “Arjuna,” in the “relationship-theater” within the Gita, [the sadhak] is also called by the names of “Partha,” “Dhananjaya,” “Pandava,” “Kaunteya,” “Sabyasachi” etc. The reason for this is: it is seen that even after arriving at the Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra, [the sadhak's] mind first showed weakness [in the manner of] having attachment and affection [towards the enemies]. And [as well], from time to time, the state of detachment also showed itself. Those particular states of mind taking place at particular times are expressed through the various names by which [the sadhak] is called. And another thing: when this [second] state comes about, Kutastha Chaitanya “Sri Krishna” comes and stands in front of the sadhak as the “driver” [specifically “charioteer” in the Gita/Mahabharata]. At this time, whatever the sadhak's mind wants to know – the answers to those become revealed in his very own consciousness via the Powerful Light of Kutastha Chaitanya. This is why Krishna is “sarathi” [charioteer]. And [the sadhak] also hears many kinds of teachings from the Ethers (teachings coming from no “form”; or: supernatural teachings). Seeing and hearing all of those things, [the sadhak] becomes astonished and stupefied. (That is what is expressed in the 11th chapter.)
 
After this – the third state.  Upon going on practicing Kriya while in that second state and gradually going farther and farther up in the brahmanadi in the sushumna, when the Bhishma-represented ignorance-ensconced “me-ness” (the “I am the body” idea) becomes inactive, then the sadhak experiences a type of samadhi. During the experience of that samadhi, [the sadhak's] sadhana efforts stop, and the accumulated karmas in the form of “vikarma” [that which forces one to act], in order to bring forth their fruits, draw the sadhak again and again while in his benumbed state, bring him down [from samadhi and the inner states] and altogether throw him/her into the external matters of the world. For this reason, [the sadhak] has to have discipline of mind at that time. Because there is no Light of Consciousness visible at that time, [the sadhak] has to take the help of his/her powers of memory and go on practicing Kriya blindly, and thereupon use the power of the intuitive experiential perception that he/she has acquired through sadhana, and continue to observe the practice of his/her essential sadhana. In the Gita, the sadhak is called “Dhritarashtra” [who is blind] when this state comes to be. The first sloka [of Chapter 1] refers to this state of the sadhak.
 
It is written in the Mahabharata that Dhritarashtra is Arjuna's eldest paternal uncle. So it seems like it is a stretch of the imagination to call the same sadhak one time as “Arjuna” and another time as “Dhritarashtra.” But one must remember that the Gita is a scripture of yoga. In whichever of the twenty-four essential elements, and at whichever time, that the power of consciousness does its sporting, that particular [element] at that particular time becomes enjoined with [the power of] consciousness, and [thus] goes on doing its [the particular element's] own particular work automatically. All these activities that there are – they are happening in the same body in different ways because of the differences in vrittis [aspects that cause action]. Thus, in that situation [or: in that place/body] there are no “relationships” whatsoever such as “father-mother-relative-kin [etc.].” In order to describe the experiences/scenery, all of those “relationships” are made up in order to construct the story. This is actually the main difference between a scripture of yoga and a historical account.
 
Important note: (1) In order to understand the Gita, it is necessary to understand all of those three states. Besides those three states, there are many other states for the sadhak. The last of them is the “Mahaprasthan Kaal” [the time of the great journey/death]. Its way/method is described in the eighth chapter. Speaking about all of those matters here [in this chapter] is unnecessary.
 
Important note: (2) The second state is “the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna.” For this reason the statements by Arjuna and the Lord will have to be understood according to being in this [second] state. And the third state is “the dialogue between Dhritarashtra and Sanjaya.” Therefore, the statements made by Sanjaya will have to be understood according to being in this [third] state.
 
Now the meaning of slokas 21, 22, and 23 [of Chapter 1] are being stated:
 
Upon reaching exactly the middle of the entrance of the sushumna, the sadhak sees the Beautiful and Powerful Light of the Kutastha as “Achyuta” - meaning: Still, Steady, yet full of the Power of Attraction. As that happens, [the sadhak's] power of looking is completely caught in That, and his/her sight is not moving in any other direction. It has become still. (This is the “Achyuta” state.) Even though the sadhak's sight is still in this way, because his/her desires for worldly ways have not been finished, he/she falls to restlessness as well. But because of following guru's teachings, [the sadhak] also has acquired the strength to stand in the middle of the two opposing forces of pravritti-nivritti or attachment-detachment (in the middle of the soldiers from both sides). (This experience is stated in the 21st sloka [of Chapter 1]. At this time, the sadhak is thinking, “Let me see once – which of the vrittis are now banded together and are here as my rivals [and] which of the ones will I be fighting alongside? And which are the vrittis that keep the vrittis of worldly desires strong that have now arisen in the mind?” (23rd sloka [of Chapter 1])
"
"24,25","Sanjaya said, “O Bharat [Dhritarashtra]! Upon this utterance by Arjuna, the one who is victorious over sleep, Hrishikesh [Sri Krishna] [drove] the most excellent chariot and set it in the [area in the] middle of the soldiers of the two sides – in front of Bhishma, Drona and all of the royalty [present] – and said these words: 'O Partha [Arjuna]! Look, and observe all of these [persons] from the Kurus.'”","Upon coming back down after Kriya – as mentioned before – and having become mind-oriented [again], [the sadhak] is again witnessing through his/her inner perception. That is why it is stated, “Sanjaya said.” And being mind-oriented, [the sadhak] is thinking about him/herself. That is why [the sadhak] is in the state of “Bharat.” “BhArata”: “bha” = luminescence; light; “rati” in that [light] = addiction – the one who has [this addiction to that light] is “Bharat.” Only Consciousness is revelatory light, and Prakriti [Nature] as the twenty-four elements is non-revelatory/hiding. One who looks at the light of the Self from being under the power of Prakriti – it is he/she who is “Bharat.”
 
“GuDAkesha”: (“gudDAkA” = sleep, laziness; “eesha” = rulership) = victor over sleep. The sadhak without laziness is called “Gudakesh.” The state of non-stop establishment in Kriya is the state of “Gudakesh.” It is when one becomes victorious over sleep that one attains “achyuta” [common noun – the state of being imperturbable/indestructible]. The one who has vanquished the ignorance-filled sleep and is capable of taking refuge in the Knowledge-filled “sleep” (the samadhi-rest) is the one who is “the victor over sleep” - meaning: [the sadhak] who, instead of falling to the restlessness because of tiredness and oncoming sleep during the practice of Kriya, is able to become established in the Light-filled State. Continuously thinking about worldly matters and becoming overcome by the tiredness that is connected to that [constant thinking] is called “ajnanaja nidra” [ignorance-filled sleep] or  [simply] “nidra” [sleep]. And the waveless rest that comes about while continuously looking at the Self, when all of the movements in consciousness [vrittis] of worldly matters disappear – that is what is called “jnanaja nidra” [Knowledge-filled “sleep”], the “Sleep of abiding in the Self” or “samadhi.” In this state of being “Gudakesh,” if some types of desires come forth in the mind, the power to “work” those desires through the mental sense-faculties also comes about. That power is revealed from the Kutastha Itself. This is why “Achyuta” [proper noun – the Indestructible/Imperturbable] at that time is called “Hrishikesh” (the ruler over the aggregate of the senses). Although these states are subtle, they can be easily/naturally known by just making a little effort in the path of sadhana. When that type of desire to put oneself in the middle [of the two sides of the vrittis] (as written in the 21st sloka) comes about, through “Hrishikesh” (the power to rule over the senses), attained through the grace of guru, the sadhak takes his “most high/excellent chariot” and sets it in the middle, [the area] between the soldiers of both sides.
 
“Rathottama” [the most high/excellent chariot]: “Rath” [chariot] means that on which one can sit and travel – meaning: the place of sitting or settling [oneself]. There are three places of settling between the Muladhar[-chakra] to the Ajna-chakra: “Dang” [alternate transliteration: “daṃ”] - in the middle between the Muladhar and the Svadhisthan in the area of sexual desire; “yang” [alt: “yaṃ”] at the Anahata; and “pang” [alt: paṃ] – above the Vishuddha and below the Ajna at the mastak-granthi. (See Illustration no. 2.) Keeping the mind-form in the “da” area, there is only the knowledge of Muladhar; if it is kept in the “ya” area, Muladhar, Svadhisthan, Manipur and Ajna – the knowledge of these four chakras comes about; and if [the mind-form] is kept in the “pa” area, all of the causalities – beyond the actions of the five elements – that are related to the aggregate of the [twenty-four] subtle elements become directly evident. And more, while staying in the “pa” area, the sadhak has to be “Kapidhvaja” [see first line of the commentary on sloka 20 of Chapter 1] and the charioteer Krishna [see explanation of Krishna as “sarathi” in the third paragraph of the commentary on slokas 21, 22 and 23 of Chapter 1]. This is why, during the practice of sadhana, that “pa” area is called “rathottama” [the most excellent chariot; or: most high chariot].
 
“Ubhaya senA” [soldiers of both sides]: Pravritti (the vrittis [activities of consciousness] going towards samsara) and nivritti (the vrittis that are directed away from samsara). “Pravritti” - the world-oriented ego, or the reflected consciousness (Bhishma) and the samskarically corrupted intellect (Drona) operating the desire- and want-filled lust, anger, delusion, pride, avarice etc., and the things that support and are supported by these, such as: sleep, drowsiness, doubt, fear, laziness, dilatoriness and such group of vrittis that are obstacles against sadhana. “Nivritti” - discrimination, detachment, knowledge, devotion, reverence, serenity, self-control, forbearance, desisting from sensual desires, resolve, spiritual longing and such group of vrittis that are supportive of sadhana.
 
Even after keeping one's sight on Kutastha, receiving the Light of Consciousness directly, and claiming the most excellent/high place and setting oneself between the two – worldly-matter-directed and Self-directed – vrittis, the previously accumulated world-oriented samskaras become very subtle at this time and go in all directions. For this reason, the “me and mine” feeling becomes stronger. This “me and mine” manifests directly from the jiva's own Prakriti [Nature]. It is Prakriti that is the mother. That is why that state of the sadhak has been referred to as “Partha.” “Partha” = the son of “Pritha” [another name for Kunti who was Arjuna's mother] - meaning: the sadhak with motherly feelings. “Prath” = being famous; “a” = the sound of speech signifying “doing” - meaning: the one who is naturally [or: by oneself, automatically] famous or renowned – that is the one who is called “Pritha.” Prakriti [Nature] is Herself the Renowned One. The well-renowned ones who emerge from this Prakriti – they are the ones who are called “Partha.” (Space = Yudhishthira, air = Bhima, fire = Arjuna – this is why they are also called “Partha” - because they are revealing themselves upon manifesting their motherly characteristics.) At this time, as the sadhak is progressing according to the teachings of guru and remaining faced towards the East, he/she goes on looking at the [vrittis of the] opposition, represented by Bhishma, Drona and the whole group of the primary [world-directed] vrittis (by which [the experience of] “mahi” [can happen] - meaning: the earthly pleasures can be enjoyed). At that time, “look at all of these [persons] gathered here from the Kaurava side” - this kind of perception rises in [the sadhak's] heart."
26,"Immediately after that, Arjuna saw the fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, as well as the friends, fathers-in-law and dear ones from both armies. He saw that all of them are present there.","Then that motherly-feeling-oriented sadhak went on to see all of the essential vrittis, both opposing and supportive. In the body of the human being, [one can find] through the help of sadhana that there are many such natural/simple nadis through which many types of vrittis rise forth with the aid of mind and intellect. And once one vritti rises, from that several new vrittis are created. In this way, the vrittis, mixed and unmixed, keep rising up in innumerable forms. The saintly sages, who were surrendered to God, were scientists of the body [physical, subtle and causal]; they spoke about [the subtle things] by re-representing the [inner] forms dressed up as characters of samsaric relationships. It is for this reason that words such as “father” and “grandfather” etc. are being used here. "
27,"That son of Kunti (Arjuna), upon seeing all of those friends being present at the place of war, became overcome with pathos and despondency, and said these words.","The sadhak, after having received the teachings of guru and proceeding to attain establishment in the Supreme State, sees that – verily – all of the vrittis [inner aspects that cause action] of worldly enjoyments will have to be destroyed. But even though [the sadhak] has an intense desire to be established in the Supreme State, because the desire to enjoy worldly ways are strong at that [same] time, he/she perceives the vrittis of “bhoga” [worldly-enjoyments] as the relations that are most close to him/her, whereupon [the sadhak] softens the strict teachings of guru, and in order to firm up one's own desirousness according one's own wishes, he/she starts crying – like whining a mantra that enamors one [to bhoga]. “I will enjoy the worldly things. I will also do yoga. And I will also be a sadhu. If it is like this, then that will be really what I like.” That effort to stay bound to the powers of one's own desires has been addressed with the word “Kaunteya” [son of “Kunti” – Arjuna's mother]. Kunti used a mantra of attractive powers and brought gods under her power. Similarly, Arjuna too emulates his mother's nature and [seemingly] brings Krishna (guru) under his [Arjuna's] power and tries to be both bhogi and yogi.
 
Guru has instructed to give up the desires for worldly things, but the disciple, feeling that those very worldly-desires are his most intimate possessions, is being very compassionate (addicted) towards them. Thereafter, the kinds of feelings that rise up in the mind when one is in this kind of state – [the sadhak/Arjuna] speaks about that.
"
"28,29","Arjuna said, “O Krishna! Upon seeing these relatives present in front of me, all of my limbs have lost all energy and my mouth has become dry. My body is trembling and full of chills. The “gandiva” [bow] is falling from my hands and my body is burning.” ","Because of the sadhak's mental restlessness becoming overwhelming during this state, sweat comes out of the body; the mouth becomes dry; the whole body trembles and becomes full of chills. The “gandiva” [bow] falls off, and there is a kind of burning sensation in the whole body. These experiences are known personally by anyone who can even be called a sadhak. So there is no need to explain [this matter] that much. But some explanation is necessary for [the statement] “the 'gandiva' [bow] falls off.” When sitting in the “samaṃ kAyashrogreevaṃ” [body, head and neck in line; posture of sitting straight; see paragraph beginning with “Dhanurudyamya” in the commentary on sloka 20 of Chapter 1], the sadhak's spinal column in the back becomes bowed [towards the front of the body]. The back then looks just like a canoe/skiff; the spinal column in that condition is called “gandiva” [bow]. Right at the time restlessness comes to the mind of the sadhak, the body begins to tremble, and because of tension in the whole body, the sadhak cannot remain straight and still any longer. The body droops, and the “jnana-mudra” in the hand comes open. That condition has been referred to as “the bow falling off.”"
30,I cannot sit here any more. It is as if my mind is spinning. O Keshava [Sri Krishna]! I am seeing all kinds of inauspicious omens.,"At this time, the sadhak feels extremely helpless and cannot even take one more step forward in sadhana. The mind, having become very restless, starts to wander everywhere [or: spins], and inauspicious omens begin to be seen. So, naturally, the sadhak is bound to say, “I thought yoga is supposed to be for the attainment of Peace in the Supreme State – instead of that happening – O Keshava [Sri Krishna]! (See the 14th sloka of the 10th Chapter for the meaning of “Keshava.”) What I am seeing is exactly the opposite – torturous, full of terrible pain – like experiencing hell. I cannot remain still any more."
31,O Krishna! I do not see anything good in killing relatives in war. I do not want victory. I don't want the kingdom. I do not even want happiness.,"The use of the word “Krishna” in these slokas has been used exactly according to what is happening at this time. Krishna is Kutastha Chaitanya. “KṛShirbhurvAchako shabda Nakacha nirvANavAchakah; tayoraikyaṃ      kṛShNamityabhidheeyate.” [The sound “kṛShi” [ordinary meaning: farmer] speaks of the earth and the sound “Na” speaks of “Nirvana” [Final Liberation]; together [He] is called “Krishna.”] “Kṛshi” = sound representing the ploughing of the earth; “Nak” = sound representing “Nirvana” [Final Liberation]. The One Who pulls the person up and makes one attain Nirvana – He is the One Who is “Krishna.” Because of the desires for worldly things being strong in the mind of the sadhak, the mind becomes restless and wants to come downwards. And the body also becomes lax. But that Bewitching Form of the Kutastha that brings intoxicating ecstasy to the heart, keeps [the sadhak] pulled back [towards Kutastha]. It is as if: even if there is the desire to come down, [Kutastha/Sri Krishna] does not let [the sadhak] come down. This state of the sadhak is just like “the snake having caught the mouse.” If [the sadhak] lets go [turns away], he/she becomes blind – meaning: [the sadhak] can no longer see that heart-intoxicating Form. If [the sadhak] goes [towards Kutastha] (meaning: if one smothers and soaks oneself in that Light), then [the sadhak] dies – meaning: all of those entrenched desires are destroyed. Now [the sadhak] is afraid of both. That is why he/she is saying: “O Krishna! I do not see any benefit in destroying all of these vrittis in this war – meaning: through pranayam Kriya (because instead of peace, only disturbance is coming forth). I do not want “vijaya” [victory]; I do not even want “rajya” [kingdom] or “sukha” [happiness]. “Vijaya” [victory] = “samyama” [the coming together of dharana [concentration], dhyan [meditation] and samadhi]; “rAjyaṃ sukhani” [kingdom and happiness] = the attainment of Perfection through yoga."
"32,33,34","O Govinda [Sri Krishna]! What need do we have for the kingdom? And what good are enjoyments and pleasures? What is the need even for life itself? Those for whom we pray for kingdom, enjoyments and happiness – those very people are these teachers, sons, and what is more – even grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandchildren, brothers-in-law and [other] family members [or: relatives]. O Madhusudan [Sri Krishna]! Even if these [persons] kill us, I do not wish to kill these [persons].","“Govinda”: the sound “go” represents the Earth. The One Who rules this Earth – He is the One Who is Govinda. Now the sadhak is seeing: whatever the activities of the inner operations that are going on in this field of the body – all of that is being manifested/revealed via Kutastha Chaitanya. [The sadhak] is perceiving/understanding quite well that he/she has no authority [or: doership] over anything at all. All that is, is happening via the Consciousness-Power. Yet, having become caught up in the swirl of Maya, the delusion of “mine and others'” [or: “me and others]” is not going away. That is why, when Knowledge is being revealed, [the sadhak] is knowing Kutastha Chaitanya as “Govinda,” and [then] again, taking up the motherly feeling (the addiction [to samsara] coming from the idea of “me and mine”), [the sadhak] is saying, “What will we get out of having the kingdom? What need is there for enjoyments? Is life even necessary at all? The ones with whom I desire to enjoy the kingdom and enjoy happiness – I am seeing that they are the very ones who will lose their life and their possessions in this war. O Madhusudan [Sri Krishna]! That I die – that is even better. I am not willing to destroy (give up) all of this.
 
Now let us see: “kingdom,” “enjoyments,” “happiness” - what are these? The purpose/aim of sadhana is to be Liberated from the bondage of samsara which comes in the form of birth and death – meaning: leaving behind death-ness and attaining immortality. The body is made up of six “vikaras” [modifications/mutations] -  “asti, jAyate, vardhate, vipariNamate, apaksheeyate, vinashyati iti ShaTvikArAh” [existence, birth, growth, change/mutation, decay, death – these are the six “vikaras” [modifications/mutations [of the body]]. At the very beginning [of sadhana], the sadhak believes that those modifications/mutations will be ended through the practice of sadhana, and that he/she will have possession and power over the “kingdom” in the form of this body. [The sadhak] will “enjoy” this kingdom in any way he/she wishes and be “happy.” In short, [the sadhak] will become “jivanmukta” [Liberated while alive in the body], and [at the same time] he/she will stay on water, land, air [any place wished for] and will enjoy the Bliss of Brahman along with enjoying the worldly ways. But, as [the sadhak] actually “gets hands-on practice” of sadhana, he/she sees that everything is against him/her. From right at the beginning, [the sadhak] has to give up the desires of enjoyments; after that, the ego has to be destroyed forever; and worldly thinking has to be totally abandoned. And [the sadhak] sees even more: one has to bring all of the senses such as eyes, ears, nose etc. and close all of the “doors” [openings of the body]; not only that, even the mind itself has to be locked-up into the heart, and [along with that] prana has to be established in the head. When [the sadhak] endeavors to do all of these things, he/she perceives [the situation] as a life-ending physical torment. At that time one thinks, “There is no need any more for the enjoyment of happiness that comes from being Liberated while alive. I am fine just the way I am. Even if I die, that is also fine; still there is no good in destroying the desires for enjoyments. [I know that] desires are never fulfilled in samsara; one has to always experience lack. Even that is fine; I still cannot bear this suffering. By stopping the eyes and ears and such, I will have to become blind and deaf. There is no need to carry around this lump of flesh in that condition and be called a 'jivanmukta.' And more, will the deep need really be fulfilled by giving up the desires for enjoyments and staying alive in this kind of way? Even death is better.”
Because of ignorance, the [sadhak] becomes unsettled by the challenges of sadhana, and this type of grief arises in the mind in the beginning. If one makes even a little effort in the path of sadhana, all of these things are directly known.
 
“Madhusoodana”: Having become unsettled with physical and mental torment, [the sadhak] believes him/herself to be in grave danger. And remembering the dictum “vipatte madhusoodanah” [in danger, [call] Madhusudan], [the sadhak] goes on uttering “Madhusudan” towards Kutastha. The reason: the Lord is called “Madhusudan” - as He destroys evil. As:
 
“madhukleebaṃcha mAdhveeke kṛtakarmA shubhAshubhe
bhaktAnaṃ karmanAṃchaiva soodanaṃ madhusoodanah;
pariNAmAshubhaṃ karma bhrantAnAṃ madhuraṃ madhu
karoti soodanaṃ yohi sa eva madhusoodanah.”
 
“AchAryah pitarah putrAh” [teachers, fathers, sons] etc.: The kinds of powers that are attained by the sadhak through the practice of Kriya of the vital-air in the nadis and chakras, and the particular types of vrittis that arise in those paritcular powers – those are the things that have been referred to as these “teachers, fathers, sons” etc. One who does Kriya and becomes established in Kriya comes to know about all of these things by oneself. Speaking about that knowledge gained by personal and direct experience would be nothing but a ridiculous endeavor."
35,"What to speak of something as small as the Earth, even if [we] get rulership of the three worlds I do not wish to kill these persons. O Janardan [Sri Krishna]! What kind of happiness will we gain by killing the persons on the side of Dhritarashtra?","“JanArdana” = (jana [people] + arda [request] = to beg for [or: supplication] + “anaT” [suffix of function]) the One Who is supplicated by people for the purpose of attaining the Supreme Substance. [The sadhak is] using the term “Janardan” because this type of feeling is appearing in the heart of the sadhak: “O guru! Please have mercy! I cannot accept this kind of hardship. What I can do? [If there is] something by which I can both have bhoga and yoga – tell me some way like that.” (Now, the sadhak is being run by the samsaric intellect, yet at the same time, he has taken up the attitude of righteousness/spirituality and is trying to hold his/her own."
"36,37","Even though these [persons on the side of Dhritarashtra] are killers, if we kill them we will incur sin. Therefore, it is not right for us to kill our friends such as Duryodhana and others. O Madhav! What kind of happiness will we gain by killing our own?","“MAdhav[a]”: “mA” = “[Goddess] Lakshmi”; “dhav[a]” = husband. The sadhak is thinking: “The One Who is the Ruler of the three worlds – He is “Madhav.” And it is He Who is the Teacher of Yoga as well. So both bhoga and yoga are present in Him. Then it is best to be like Him.” So, [the sadhak] is thinking in his mind: “Yes, of course it is true that because all of these [hindering] vrittis are in me – that is why I am finding obstacles in the path of sadhana. But does my dharma remain in tact after destroying all of these [hindering vrittis]? I cannot exist even for a moment without the help of the samsaric senses manifesting as and in the form of the body. If stopping the works of the senses is 'yoga,' then what shall I call 'sin'? If the works of the senses are stopped, then there will be troubles in the body (personal afflictions). That cannot ever be 'dharma' [spirituality/righteousness]. Killing my own will only beget sin. How can it be that I would get happiness [from that]? Therefore, O guru, if there is a way of yoga where all of this [bhoga] can be preserved [as well], then tell me [about that]. If not, I cannot be involved in carrying out these sinful activities.”"
"38,39","Although these [persons on the side of Dhritarashtra] have lost their perception due to being under the power of greed and cannot see the crime of destroying lineage and causing harm to friends, but – O Janardan! Why should we [persons on the side of the Pandavas] not turn away from this sinful action, as we can see the crime of destroying lineage?","In the 5th sloka of the 6th Chapter, it is written: “Atmaiva hyatmano bandhurAtmaiva ripurAtmanah” - meaning: one is one's own friend; one is one's own enemy. When the person remains a slave to desires in this “kingdom” represented by the body, the person him/herself is sometimes a lustful being, sometimes a bhogi, sometimes even a thief. The person dresses up in these various costumes. At that time, good ways just do not feel good to his/her mind. Even if feelings towards the good come up in the mind, the person finds them intolerable and he/she chases them away. But again, when the person goes on thinking in righteous ways or is engaged in doing righteous work, at that time he/she does not like unrighteous thoughts coming up in the mind. When unrighteous thoughts come up in the mind, the person perceives them as enemies and chases them out of his/her mind. And then again, the person advises him/herself to disengage from unrighteous thoughts and be engaged in good works. One is one's own teacher; one is one's own disciple. This is known just from living as a human being. It is the same in sadhana. The same sadhak is at one time Dhritarashtra, at another time Duryodhana and such people, and at yet another time [the sadhak] dresses up and appears as Bhishma, Drona, Karna etc. as well. Because of being under the power of desires, whatever particular kinds of feelings/thoughts rise up in the mind at particular times, [the sadhak] takes up those particular forms at those times. Then again, when the time comes for destroying desires, or when [the sadhak] makes the effort [to destroy desires] – then as well, whatever particular kinds of feelings/thoughts that arise in the mind at particular times, [the sadhak] him/herself creates a form appropriate to those feelings/thoughts. Because of this, oneself is sometimes lord; sometimes oneself is teacher. Sometimes, by the Full Revelation of the Light of the Self, one merges in Kutastha Chaitanya and even becomes guru to oneself. And then again, one comes down from Kutastha and, becoming the jiva dressed up as Arjuna, engages in enquiry [on Reality]. In short, [it is] the same sadhak; whatever kinds of states that he/she comes to, he/she acts according to those particular states. This “ekal-snede-pana” [self-oriented-ness] is an essential teaching of the Gita.
 
The meaning within these slokas 37 and 38 are exactly like this [as written in the above paragraph]. The sadhak goes on speaking to him/herself, perceiving that one's own adversarial vrittis are imbued with awareness. All of the vrittis have come forth from the same antahkarana; therefore, they all belong to the same “lineage.” All of them have the work of bringing forth the totality of the knowledge of the [phenomenal] universe, from the creator Brahmaa to the finest matter, onto the picture-screen of the chitta. Thus, they are “friends” (doing the same work). The difference [between the two sides of the vrittis] is this: one group is only bringing the Knowledge of Brahman and illuminating the chitta, and another group is only bringing the knowledge of worldly ways and covering the chitta['s perception]. The sadhak, being one of the members of the group that is associated with the Knowledge of Brahman (Arjuna), is saying to his/her own self, having [also] become guru in the form of Kutastha Chaitanya ([saying] to Janardan): “The people of the group associated with worldly ways, because of being under the power of greed, have become murder-conscious. If this war begins, that there will be destruction for both sides and therefore there will be the sin of destroying lineage and the sin of killing friends – they [vrittis of worldly ways] cannot see this. Nevertheless, why should we, who know [about incurring this sin] very well, not turn away from this sin?”"
40,"If the lineage is destroyed, all of age-old dharmas regarding lineage will be destroyed. If dharmas are destroyed, then adharma [unrighteous ways] will take over (swallow up) all lineages.","“Kulakshaya” [destruction of lineage]: “ku” - the worldly ways related to sound, touch etc. [sense perceptions]; “la” - the desire for enjoyments. “Vishaya[s]” [matters; subjects] are of two types. The enjoyments/partakings that happen via the eyes, ears, nose etc. externally is “vishaya.” And again, the subtle experiences of sight, taste and such that happen internally when one is directed towards the Self – that is also “vishaya.” The first is “external vishaya”; thus they are matter-oriented/physical. The second is “internal vishaya”; thus they are subtle. The external vishayas wrap one up in bhoga, and with the internal vishayas one avoids bhoga. These material and subtle experiences of vishayas happen verily via the seventeen “kalaas” [active functioning parts]. Ten senses, five pranas, mind and intellect – these are what are called the “seventeen kalaas.” Desires, detachment etc. - whatever vrittis there are, all of them verily rise up from these seventeen kalaas and are known by all kinds of names. The aggregate of all of these [vrittis] are what is being called “lineage” [here]. In the war for the Self – that which is called the “the sadhana battles” - these [vrittis] get destroyed. Each of these [vrittis] has a particular active quality – or “dharma.” Like: the dharma of the eyes is seeing; the dharma of the ears is hearing; the dharma of the mind is resolve or doubt, etc. Because these dharmas are born with the [birth of the] body and are ever-present in consciousness, they are called “sanatana” [age-old] – meaning: (everyone's) age-old [ways]. If that “lineage-destruction” takes place, then this “sanatana dharma” [age-old way] is destroyed. Like: if the eyes become powerless, one cannot see; if the ears lose their strength, one cannot hear; if the mind is weak, one cannot have resolve or doubt, etc. After this kind of annihilation – meaning: destruction – whatever remains will be taken over by adharma [unrighteous ways] – meaning: everything will be turned upside-down, like hearing “kaan” [ears] when someone is saying “dhaan” [unhusked rice], or seeing yellow where there is white because of hepatitis, etc."
41,"O Krishna! If the evil ways which are opposite to dharma are taken, then the women of the lineages will become corrupted. O “Varshneya” [Sri Krishna]! If the qualities of women become evil, then the “varnas” [castes] become corrupted.","If this kind of unrighteousness – meaning: contrarian way – is present, then the women of the lineages will become corrupted. That from which there is offspring is called “stree” [woman]. All of the internal and external operators/senses [in the body], by having intercourse with consciousness, bring forth many vrittis such as pleasure, pain, desire, detachment, attachment, repulsion etc. Thus, this body and the senses are all “women.” All of these women will become corrupted – meaning: the body will be full of troubles. And being full of troubles, there will be corruption in the “varna[s]” [castes; alternate meaning: form[s]] – meaning: the beauty and radiance of the body will be ruined, and the functioning powers of the bodily instruments will also change; they will not remain in their original condition."
42,It will be like hell for the corrupted castes and the destroyers of lineage. The ancestors of these [persons] will lose their “luptapindodakakriya” [a rite related to ancestral appeasement with the offering of rice balls and water] and surely fall (to hell).,"The Light of Brahman does not reveal Itself in the consciousness of an afflicted body. At that time, there is always troubled thinking [and] engagements and thoughts in bad directions [etc.]. Thus, the body is harmed from all sides [or: in all ways]. And that which comes during the continuous practice of Kriya in a healthy body from “anubhava” [ordinary meaning: experience] ([the meaning here] to become “anu” [atomic; subtlest of the subtle]):  the meetings with those great saints, the witnessing of the Light of Brahman, and the nectar that falls from the Sahasrar (udak [liquid]) and nourishes all and everything – all of those things disappear; pranayam (Kriya) does not happen on the correct “road.” Thus all such “anubhava” is destroyed. During the time of this “anubhava,” there is no awareness of the body, but all of the functions of the body continue through the activity of the subtle body, as if [the body is] in the waking state. After death, the ancestors, in shadowless energy forms, also experience acts in the subtle body; this can be seen. The ancestors' state and this state of “anubhava” is therefore the same; it is just that the physical body is not dead [for the sadhak] and so there is a slight difference. Because that “anubhava” too stops [because of aforementioned reasons], it is called the “fall of the realm of ancestors,” and the “disappearance of rice balls [representing the ancestors], water and rites.”"
43,The destroyers of lineage will completely lose the dharmas of the particular castes and the age-old righteousness/righteous works associated with lineages because of all of these sins of corrupting the castes.,"As aberrations occur in the body because of harm coming to the “varna” [form; caste], the body becomes unable to function [properly]. Whatever the pure dharma of particular castes and lineages are – they disappear because they [the pure dharmas] cannot be carried out by that corrupted form of the body. "
44,O Janardan! We have heard that those people for whom the lineage-dharmas are destroyed – they are destined to live in hell.,"“JanArdana”: “jana” = birth; “ardana” = to persecute. The One Who persecutes birth – meaning: the One Who bestows Liberation – it is He Who is called “Janardan.” Here, it is Kutastha Chaitanya that is being addressed as: “O Janardan! It is heard that those who have mind-dharma – if those dharmas of the body are corrupted for them and if that [corruption] brings about the imminent death of the body, then high thinking and feeling no longer comes about for them; [then] there is no ability left even to do any kind of repentance (meaning: [no ability remaining] for accomplishing purification of the chitta through special Kriya). There is no end to their terrible pain, and because of that, their thinking becomes low-minded and the death of the body comes about."
45,"Uff! What a calamitous situation! We are about to incur great sin as we get ready to destroy our own people, driven by our greed for the pleasures of the kingdom.","O Lord! O Lord! I have fallen into the delusional sorcery called yoga! And that “caste” of mine that is my body – I am destroying that and putting my hand out to get a kingdom. Alas, what a great sin I am committing! I – myself – am destroying my own body. I am committing suicide. How great is this greed for pleasure!! Shame! Shame! Shame!!!
 
Upon starting up with yoga, the sadhak at first cannot understand the science of yoga because of being under the power of ignorance and thus feels weary and hopeless. At that time, the kinds of thoughts stated in slokas 28 to 43 [of Chapter 1] go on in the mind, and this kind of contempt comes about."
46,"If the armed members of the side of Dhritarashtra find me unarmed and kill me [even though they see me unarmed], even that will be supremely beneficent for me.","When contempt [such as this] comes to the mind, the sadhak goes on to think: “Okay, I am done. I am not going to perform yoga-Kriya any more. Not only am I not going to take up the weapon in the form of pranayam to destroy the magnetism of worldly vrittis, [but] I am not going to take any retaliatory action [against the vrittis of the worldly ways] whatsoever. If by doing this I end up writhing in the torment of being attacked by all of the Dhritarashtra-vrittis – meaning: the vrittis directed towards samsara – and even if I have to die because of that, even that is good. It is still not good to destroy the vrittis of all of the senses, become disabled in body, and exist like a dead man while still living. I have no need to perform this kind of yoga and get the Kingdom of Brahman.”"
{47}{stop},"Sanjaya said: “Saying this, Arjuna, overcome with terrible grief, threw off his “shar dhanuh” [arrows and bow] and just sat [despondently] on the chariot on the battlefield.","It is spoken about like this [meaning: what is in the sloka] when the sadhak, overcome by grief, throws off his/her bow – meaning: lets the spine slump; [the sadhak] no longer remains straight. Because of the spine no longer being straight, prana (“shar” [arrow]) can no longer climb up an easy and unhindered road; it becomes crooked (it goes in a bad direction). At this time, the sadhak just becomes beset by thoughts (“on the chariot”*)13 and, looking at Kutastha, only sits there quietly. Overcome by troubles in the initial stages of sadhana, every sadhak has to go through this kind of hopelessness due to the intense mire of ignorance. — Begin Footnote. — See the commentary on sloka no. 3 in Chapter 2 for the definition of “sitting on the chariot.” — End Footnote. — Those who are just beginning to progress in the path of sadhana and have not yet received the power to witness the Still Light of the Self upon entering the sushumna, even they can come to know this state [in the above sloka] within a short while after doing some pranayam. This is because: as the practice has not matured, the whole body begins to experience pain and tension, particularly in the knees which feel the need to be massaged; the [sadhak] can no longer stay settled; [the sadhak] straightens the legs, lets the body slump, and, upon becoming somewhat hopeless with the matter of sadhana, [the sadhak] becomes aloof and despondent and just sits there quietly. The kind of despondency that takes the sadhak over in the first stage of yoga – that is what is spoken of here in the first chapter [of the Bhagavad Gita] named “Vishadayoga” [the yoga of being despondent]."
