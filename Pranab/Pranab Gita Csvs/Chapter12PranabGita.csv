1,"Arjuna said: “Those devotees who are constantly steadfast in worshipping You in this way, and those who worship only the Eternal Formless – which of them are more knowledgeable in yoga?” ","The one who worships You constantly in that previously mentioned way, while having immovable faith in guru’s teachings, and the one who worships the Eternal Formless – which one among these two is higher (greater) in yogic knowledge? The sadhak is seeing: this witnessing of the Cosmic Form – the union of “I” and “You” did not happen in this. Is this sadhana [spiritual path] better, or – the one in which “I” and “You” become One – is that sadhana better? Which one of these is greater? "
2,"[The Lord said:] “Those who submerge their minds in Me, and, being fully absorbed, worship me with great faith/reverence – they are the most devoted, according to Me.”","Again, the sadhak is resolving his/her own questions through his/her own experience. With unmoving faith in the teachings of guru (with the firmness of strength to overcome all obstacles [to spiritual practice]), keeping “I” as the first priority, forgetting everything and throwing the mind into Me, uniting with the Eternal “I” (like well water in the water of the Ganges) – the one who comes near “I” and then merges with “I” – to Me that being is the most connected. "
"03,04","And those who control all of the sense-organs, perceive everything/everywhere as the same, and worship the One Who is “Anirdeshya,” “Avyakta,” “Sarvatragata,” “Achintya,” “Kutastha,” “Achal,” “Dhruva” and “Akshara” – engaged in the beneficence of all beings, they attain Me, verily.","“Aksharam” – that which has no erosion. “Anirdeshyam” – the One Who cannot be defined as anything at any time. “Avyaktam” – the One who is beyond speech – meaning: the One Who cannot even be thought of in words. “Sarvatragata” – the One Who is allpervading, like space. “Achintyam” – the One Who is not within the realm of thought – meaning: the One Who cannot be brought into thinking; “Kutastham” – whatever there is that is visible, is endowed with qualities and [as such] is erroneous [by definition] – that is “kuta” – meaning: the multifarious, imperfect things, the seeds of samsara such as ignorance etc. – that is “kuta.” Just as Maheshvara, the One Who, because of taking on the three aspects of Maya, Prakriti and Vidya, has therefore been called “Mayina,” – similarly, the One Who is the Director of the duality – He is the One Who is called “Kutastha” [the One Who is in the “kuta”]. The One Who has no abode of moving about – that is the One Who is called “Achal” [Immovable]. “Dhruva” means that which is Eternal. When one is able to have all of the sense-organs, the five pranas and mind always under control, and upon doing that, becomes engaged in the beneficence of all beings, when neither the sacred nor the profane arise any more – at that time, the aforementioned epithets of “I” are known. When one falls into that “I”, both the worship of “I” and the attaining of “I” happen. Just as the Self remains the Self even while carrying a visible body – this is also like that."
5,"The difficulties are greater for those who are fixed with their attention on the Unexpressed, because of still remaining with body-vanity/body-identification and, at the same time, going on the path of the Unexpressed. ","The sadhak is observing: those who say that they are spiritually directed, yet have not let go of body-vanity/body-identification – those who are in this condition – there is no end to their difficulties. They remain bound in the “I and mine” condition. This is because all of the actions of samsara have to do with “mine.” With great practice, one can let go of “mine” during these actions and try to fall into “I”, but unknowingly, one [still] falls into “mine” [anyway]. Therefore, one does not go into “I”. "
"06,07","O Partha! However, those who surrender all action to Me, and, with single-minded devotion, rely solely on Me, and, contemplating Me at all times and worshiping Me, fully establish their hearts in Me – I save all of those people, without delay, from the deathendowed ocean of samsara.","The one who takes all “karma” [actions] – meaning: the operation of the expelling and drawing of 21,600 breaths – and surrenders it to “I” – meaning: fully submits it in the brahmanadi, and, via the yoga of single-minded devotion, does not have the error of keeping contact with thoughts in other directions, and thereby takes up that Brahman-mantra, which is the speech of “I”, and goes on to worship by meditating on the Form of the Divine – meaning: attains the Settledness in the Self (samadhi) – that is the one who becomes “mayyAveshitachitta” [one whose mind/heart has entered into Me], and it is that being who, very quickly, is delivered from the ocean of death-samsara, as well as the calamitous current of coming and going, and [that one] remains lodged up above. One becomes “I”. The word “matparAh” [refuge in Me] in this sloka is referring to taking recourse in the Unstruck Sound – meaning: that which, according to yogic scriptures, is the “shravan” [hearing] Kriya of Kriyayoga. “MAṃ dhyAyantah” [meditation on Me] means “manan” [meditation/contemplation], and the word “upAsate” means the Kriya of “nididhyAsana” [absorption]. If the sadhak follows the teachings of guru, and perfects these three Kriyas, it does not take very long for that sadhak to be freed from samsara after that. That sadhak quickly goes beyond death — Begin Footnote. — See Chapter 2, sloka 26 [of the Pranab Gita] for the definition of “mrityu” [death]. — End Footnote. — and becomes jivanmukta [Liberated while still carrying on bodily life]."
8,"Still the mind in Me. Submerge the intellect in Me. If that is done, then you will reside up above in Me. There is no doubt about this.","Therefore, throw the mind solely into “I”; submit the intellect solely into “I”. If that is done, then, without any doubt, the Mayamutations will not be able to touch you. You will be elevated – meaning: during the time that you have to still carry a body, during that whole time you will always remain in Self-abidance in the State of the Self (be jivanmukta [Liberated while still living in the body]) above the Ajnachakra. And you will never again have to come down and be bound in the path of Prakriti. And after the body falls [physical death happens], you will most certainly become that True “I”."
9,"O Dhananjaya [Arjuna]! If you are not able to still your mind in Me, then endeavor to attain Me through “abhyasa-yoga” [spiritual practice]. ","Unless there is the carried-over benefit of high-level good works from previous lives, it is not possible to automatically still the mind and intellect in the Self without any effort. Practice is necessary. That is why the Lord is saying, “If you are unable to establish your mind in that ‘I’ like I have just said, then, in order to become ‘I’, do the practice of repeatedly uniting the mind [with ‘I’].” See the commentary to Chapter 6, sloka 26. — Begin Footnote. — If one is not able to unite the mind [in “I”] – the practices that the Lord is speaking about from the 9th to the 11 th sloka [of this Chapter 12 of the Pranab Gita] – those are not separate practices/techniques. They are sequential stages in sadhana [spiritual practice]. First: the effort to attain the Self through doing “abhyasa-yoga” [practice of spiritual methods]; second: “matkarmaparayanata” [surrendering all actions to “I”]; third: “madyogashraya” [taking recourse in the Yoga of “I”]; fourth: “yatachittata” [union of oneself to all that is]; fifth: “sarva karmaphala tyaga” [the removal of all of the fruits of all karma]. If there is no “inability” in the first stage, one cannot reach the second stage. It is the same for all of the other stages as well. It is like this: when one moves and moves [walks and walks] and eventually the body droops down and one cannot move any more – the body is unable to move. In the same way, upon continuously doing the work of “abhyasa-yoga,” that same “inability” comes about. That is when “matparayanata” [the surrendering of all actions to Me] arises. Afterwards, when “inability” comes about in this aspect, “madyogashraya” [taking recourse in the Yoga of “I”] comes about. Then when “inability” happens in this part of the work, “chitta samyata” [equipoise] happens. When this state of “samyama” [equipoise with all] comes, all of the fruits of all karma go away, and one attains “Kaivalyasthiti” [establishment in Only-ness]. All of the states of “inability” are experienced directly by oneself in sadhana [spiritual practice]. — End Footnote. —"
10,"(If) you become unable to even practice, then engage in “matkarma” [surrender all acts to Me]. If you go on doing all actions dedicated to Me, you will attain perfection. ","If you do not even have the power to practice, then surrender all actions to “I”. How does one surrender all actions? Oh but like this: one has to perform actions directed to “I” – meaning: the “I” which is Brahman. The speech of “I” is Pranava. The source of Pranava is “I”. Going on with that Pranava-utterance in the path as shown by guru, and thereby letting go of all grasping is how actions are dedicated to “I”. And through that very action, through the union of the Atma-mantra and “hangsa,” there will be “siddhi” [attainment] – meaning: one will get the greatest of that which is to be attained – meaning: the fact that you have spontaneously forgotten the Self and have dressed up as “you” – this delusion of being dressed up as “you” will disappear. And that little bit [of surrendered action] will again establish your “I-ness.” See commentary to Chapter 4, sloka 26. "
11,"If you cannot even do this, then take recourse in “madyoga” [Yoga of “I”], and thus, become “yatachitta” [union of oneself with all that is], and renounce all fruits of all karma.","The practices that were just spoken about in the previous [verses] – if you cannot do even one of those, then take refuge in My Yoga [or: the Yoga of “I”]. My Yoga [or: the Yoga of “I”] is like this: the space that exists within the brahmanadi – with the churning of that space, a sound comes forth that has no beginning or end. The [sound] that has waves going up and down – that is that which is called “shabda” [sound]; and that [sound] that is steady, without waves and without consonantal stoppages – that is that which is called “naad” [spiritual sound]. When that “naad” arises – that “naad” relieves the effort of churning, takes the sadhak [meditator] to “I” and merges the sadhak with “I”. You too must search. Find out where this waveless “naad” is in you. Put your mind in that “naad” (the Kriya is learned from guru). If that happens, then you will be separated and drawn away from physicality, the sense-organs and the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness], and you will be brought to such a place – a place where you will experience whatever makes up that which is called “all” – [you will know that] you are separate from that, and that you are not taking refuge in anything. Right after this state, you will become one with “I” and become “I”. In this state, no knowing or knowable remains. This is that which is called “madyoga” [the Yoga of “I”]. For as long as you stay in this state, there will be no doing of any karma. Thus, the fruits of karma will automatically go away. So this completes this matter on the subject of “kriyaman” karma [actions done in the present time]. [Now, about previously accumulated karma:] the “sanchit” [previously accumulated] masses of karma that were bearing fruits for you, and were ready to give you [more] fruits – all of those too, like moths flying into the brilliant flame, enter into [this state] and burn to ashes. Because you are no longer within the gunas – as the actions caused by gunas cannot find the samskaric [impression-making] qualities [in this state], they [previous karmic fruits] fall into “nirguna” [no-qualities-state] and become inoperative. And furthermore, as this state is devoid of the functioning of the word “future,” the fear of [future actions and fruits] will not be there. Thus, this practice will make you free of Maya-mutations and make you “Atmavan” [one who abides in the Self]. So, simply do this. "
12,"(When there is no discernment/insight), knowledge is certainly greater than practice; meditation is greater than knowledge; the renunciation of the fruits of actions is greater than meditation. Peace comes only after this type of renunciation. ","When there is no discernment/insight, there is sternness in practice, but there is no stability. And then again, although knowledge with discernment/insight is dry/feelingless, there is stability. This – practice and knowledge – when looking at meditation in comparison to these two, this can be understood: the union of the sadhak [meditator] to the object of meditation – both of their forms becoming one is called “dhyan” [meditation]. In this “dhyan,” the joy of union, and the tenderness of love born of the union are both verily present. In this, struggle and feelinglessness are both absent. As soon as the object of meditation and the meditator become one – in the vortex of that oneness, karma [action] and karmaphala [the fruits of action] both come to a final rest. That final rest of karma is that which is called “tyaga” [renunciation; casting off]. When there is “tyaga,” there is Endless Peace. This Peace is that which is called the “no- mind settledness,” or the “Settledness in Brahman.” That is why I am saying: knowledge is greater than practice; meditation is greater than knowledge – the meditation that has no struggle and no feelingless-ness either, yet, through the happiness born of renunciation combined with the fruits of knowledge, meditation gives one the attainment of the Settledness in Brahman, which is Peace Itself. The sadhak is seeing that it is as fruitless as “breasts hanging from the throat of a goat” [simile from an archaic time] to make up a path by oneself without laying one’s head at the feet of sadguru. On the other hand, even a little bit of wisdom from guru bears good fruit in sadhana [spiritual practice]. Gradually, that wisdom brings one to the state of meditation and brings about even more greatness. Later, when the state of samadhi comes forth, then action and the fruits of actions automatically come to their final rest. That is what is called “tyaga” [renunciation]. It is in that “tyaga” that Peace presides. "
"13,14","The one who has no hate towards any beings or things, is friendly, compassionate, without a sense of “mine,” devoid of egotism, has the same outlook in pleasure and pain, is merciful, ever content, a yogi (sober), self-controlled, full of intelligent resolve, and has surrendered mind and intellect to Me – that devotee of Mine is indeed dear to Me. ","When the sadhak [spiritual practitioner], due to the power of sadhana, locks up the mind with its volition and non-volition, as well as the intellect with its power of ascertaining – at that time, the constricting bindings in the sadhak’s antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] are loosened, and magnanimity blossoms. The feeling of resistance towards the worldly experience that was there at the time of disciplined spiritual practice – in this state, that no longer remains. Gradually, the Knowledge “everyone/everything is ‘I’” comes forth. Thus, the feelings of hate/repulsion go away. [Consequent to this Knowledge, there is the feeling] that no one is like My precious Beloved “I” [which is everyone]. Therefore, friendliness arises. The feeling “I cannot tolerate my own suffering” – that feeling spreads towards everyone, and filled with compassion, makes [everyone] one with “I”. Because everyone becomes “I”, there is no one that remains that can be called “mine.” Because there is no one present but “I”, there is no place/room for egotism to exist. No vrittis [functionalities of perception] such as pleasure and pain are at all present. Everything becomes One. Mercy is mercy. Contentment is contentment. The perception of duality that was there before – now the two merge and become one, and because of that, there is neither duality nor non-duality. Thus, this is the state of “yogi.” In this state, due to the boundless spreading out of the Self, all resolve and certainty are firmly established. The one for whom, through doing spiritual practice while having immovable faith in guru’s teaching, this state comes about – that is the one who is dear to Me. This is because that being is none other than “I”. "
15,"The one from whom “loka/s” [see commentary below] do not shrink, and, as well, one who does not shrink from the world, one who is free of mirth, indignation/hatred, fear and distress – that one is dear to Me. ","“Loka” [beings; phenomena] means “all that is visible.” When that becomes “I”, the relationship of seer and seen disappears. Thus, there is no place for the visible to be distressed by “I”, or the visible to cause distress to “I”. In distress, there is indignation/hatred. When there is no distress, there is mirth. And when there is conflict, fear arises. The one in whom none of these exist – that is verily the one who is dear to Me – meaning: “I”."
16,"The one who is free of wants, is “shuchi,” “daksha,” “udasina,” is without “vyatha,” and is “sarvarambhaparityagi” – that devotee of Mine is dear to Me","“Anapeksha” [without expectation/want; see first line of sloka 12:16 above] – one who does not expect/want anyone [or anything] and remains “alone” – meaning: experiences “Kaivalya” [Only-ness] – that is the one who is “Anapeksha.” The restlessness of mind is verily that which is “ashuchi” [unclean]. Stillness is “shuchi” [clean]. Playing around with the worldly experience in the external world is that which is called “karya” [external work/action]. One who directs these [worldly experiences] with appropriate means, yet is not stained by their contact, and actually lives in Truth during that time – that being is the one who is “daksha” [adept]. “Daksha” is “Prajapati” [lord of subjects/beings]. Those who have full emergence, settledness and then destruction – those are “praja[s]” [subjects of creation]. The one who is the ruler of these “prajas” is [considered to be] “daksha” [in control]. Like the way it is when [the ruler] sits up above and no one from below can touch him/her – so it is with the yogi in samadhi. One who lifts up the antahkarana from the created world and lives as if one is up above – that is the one who is “udasina” [detached]. The one to whose antahkarana no “adhi” or “vyadhi” — Begin Footnote. — “Adhi” means “affliction of the mind.” It is resolved by meditation/contemplation. And “vyadhi” means “affliction of the body.” Through treatment of the body – meaning: through medicines, diet and such – this is resolved. — End Footnote. — can cause any kinds of troubles – that is the one who is called “gatavyatha” [without “vyatha” [pains]; see first line of above sloka]. What to say – the one whose “karma” [any work] or “karya” [active work] has no undertaking at all – that one is the one who is called “sarvarambhaparityAgi” [one who has let go of all undertakings]. The one for whom, through having immovable faith in guru’s teachings, the fruits of sadhana have ripened – that is the one who is My devotee. Thus, that is the being who is dear to Me – meaning: “I”. "
17,"The one who does not rejoice (at getting a dear thing), does not become indignant/hateful (at getting an undesired thing), does not grieve (over the loss of something good), does not long for (that which one has no right to have), and the one who has left behind good and evil, and is devoted – that is the being who is dear to Me. ","The devoted sadhak who is not happy at getting something good, nor indignant/hateful at getting something that is not good, who does not grieve for dear ones, does not either inwardly or outwardly lust after objects to which he/she has no right, in whose heart the desire to establish virtue or vice does not arise at all – the one who is endowed with these states – that is the one who, verily, is dear to Me. Dear sadhak, see. These states that are spoken about in the aforementioned passages – what it is to be like that – to be “I” is the very same thing. "
"18,19","The devoted person who sees enemies and friends, as well as respect and shame, as the same, who fully knows that cold, heat, pleasure and pain are the same, is without attachment, has the perception that blame and praise are the same, is silent, is content with whatever is there, is “aniket” (without an abiding place), and is steady-minded – [that one] is indeed dear to Me. ","“Sanga” [association] means [in this case] “desire” [because desire is attached to a person]. If this desire does not find a place in the inner being, then – enemy (the adversary), friend (the supporter, or similar in activity), respect (reverence), disrespect (derision), cold (the experience of coldness), heat (the experience of hotness), pleasure (with which the inner person is satisfied), pain/sorrow (opposite to that [pleasure]), derision (malevolent responses), praise (lauding) – one after another, the deadliness of these adversarial functionalities is destroyed. Then – “mauni” [silent] (controlled speech), being content with whatever is there, “aniket” (being without any particular abiding place because of being in Brahman), “sthiramati” [steady-mindedness] (one whose personal consciousness has turned towards Brahman and has thus become still) – these states come forth. Among human beings, the one who is endowed with these states – that one is indeed dear to Me – meaning: that one has attained the Self Itself. "
{20}{stop},Those who practice this nectarous dharma [spiritual way] in the way that it has been now stated – those faithful/reverent devotees who are surrendered to Me are exceedingly dear to Me. ,"The devoted and faithful/reverent sadhak that correctly
practices this nectarous spiritual teaching given by Me – that being is
exceedingly dear to Me. (This is because that sadhak will most certainly
become “I” [alternate translation: is most certainly “I”].)"
