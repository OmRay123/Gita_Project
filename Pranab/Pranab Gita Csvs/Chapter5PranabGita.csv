1,"Arjuna said, “O Krishna! After speaking about 'karmasannyas' [the renunciation of actions], You are again speaking about 'karmayoga' [the yoga of spiritual act/practice]. Which is greater amongst these two? Tell me about that particular one in a definite way.”","In Chapter 4, from slokas 18 to sloka 41, the matters of surrendering all karmas [acts] have been stated. Yet again in sloka 42 [of Chapter 4] the matters of taking up yoga as the way of performing karma [spiritual act] is stated. But it is impossible to do both of these at the same time. Now, which one should be taken up? All is Brahman. Holding this idea, should one do nothing and be without action, or should one perform action? Because this kind of feeling has risen in the mind, the sadhak is asking this question, wanting to know which of these is superior."
2,"The Lord said, “'Sannyas' [renunciation] and 'karmayoga' [spiritual act/practice] are both givers of Liberation. However, among these, karmayoga is superior. ","It was said in Chapter 4, sloka 41 that gyana [Knowing] and karmasannyas [the ending of acts] are greatest, and again in this sloka it is being said that karmayoga [spiritual act] is superior. This seeming discrepancy is due to the differences in the rights [of the practitioners]. Karma [spiritual act] and sannyas [the ending of acts] are the two ends of the stairway of sadhana. Karma is of the lower, sannyas is of the upper. The one who is below – in order to go up, [that] one has to first take up karma [yogic practice]. Only then can one get sannyas. It is not possible to have sannyas without karma [spiritual act]. That is why karma is greater. And then again, one who has gone above and has taken sannyas – because that being does not have any need for karma, for that person sannyas is greatest. The sum of it is this: sannyas only happens after karma is taken up. And if sannyas happens, Liberation happens. That is why it has been said both are “nihshreyaskara” [neither are greater than the other; see end of first line of the sloka above] – meaning: [both] bestow Liberation. "
3,"O Mahabaho [mighty-armed one; Arjuna]! One who does not hate, does not crave either – that one should be known as the “nityasannyasi” [eternally renunciant]. This is because only the conflict-free person easily attains Liberation from the bindings of samsara.","Desiring to attain powers in Kriya is “craving.” And the desire to get rid of the natural way of being is “hate.” One who is free of that hate and craving, and performs Kriya simply according to the teachings of guru, and takes care to see if Kriya is being performed just as was taught or not (other than this there are no other feelings in the mind) – it is only that person who is “nishkama” [without desire]. The conflicts of pleasure and pain, attraction and repulsion and such are not there in that person. For this kind of sadhak, no kinds of “kashmal” comes in front of him/her [see Chapter 2, sloka 2 for explanation of “kashmal”]. The path of the Self for that person remains free and clear. For this reason, “mukti” [emancipation] – meaning: merging in Vishnu-ness – is an easy attainment for that sadhak. This is why that sadhak is “nityasannyasi” [eternally renunciant]."
4,Only ignorant persons say that sankhya and yoga are different. The pandits [wise ones] do not speak thusly. The one who practices either one of these two completely – that person receives the fruit of both.,"Those who do not perform karma [yogic act], or have not received the permission to enter into karma [yogic act] – even if they are knowledgeable in many scriptures, they are “children” - meaning: ignorant, or scholars who have never practiced. [They are children/ignorant] because they cannot actualize spiritual Truth. On the other hand, those who are “karmis” [performers of the yogic act] – even if they do not have knowledge of the scriptures, because they ascend through spiritual truth after spiritual truth and then directly experience the Primal Cause of the entire universe, they are “pandit[s]” [wise ones]. Those ignorant ones (scholars with no practice) rely only on inference. They just manipulate the language in convoluted ways, and separate this from that, that from another – nothing more. They have no ability to actually go deep and find out directly. But those who are “pandits” [yogis], they see that the water flow of the Triveni [three particular rivers; or: [in yoga -] aggregate of three inner pathways] is the same whether the pathways are seen as connected or whether they are seen as independent. The result from taking a bath and drinking from the united pathways of the Triveni is the same as in the independent pathways. Thus, whichever one it may be, take recourse in one of them [sankhya or yoga] completely – meaning: by surrendering mind and prana [or: surrendering all], purify the inner way (inner place). Now, the path of yoga is the same. The result that comes about when mind is put into prana and then one continually and in every way does “brahmaNyAdhAya karmANi mamanusmaran” [dedicates all karma [practice; or: actions] to Brahman and meditates on “Me” [the Self; the Lord]] [sankhya] – the same result comes about when one crosses Kutastha, goes up to the Sahasrar and, putting mind into mind, merging into the Naad, and becomes extinguished [yoga]. Both are Liberation [or: both result in Liberation]. No matter how it is done, all that matters is that the chitta is merged/dissolved [into Brahman], whether that is done through karma [yogic practice] or through sankhya [awareness]. That is why it has been said “ekamapyasthitah samyak” [take one of them and practice it wholly; see second line of the above sloka]."
5,"The abode that is attained by the sannyasis who are established in gyana – the karmayogis [practitioners of spiritual yoga] attain that very abode as well. Thus, the one who sees sankhya and yoga as the same – it is that person who is a true seer.","The Kriya of the six chakras is yoga; and the Kriya of the Sahasrar is sankhya. The culmination of both is the same (see the previous sloka [5:4]). The one brahmanadi within the sushumna goes from the Muladhar to the brahmarandhra in the Sahasrar. If one enters wholly into this brahmanadi, the differences in chakras no longer remain. All become one. One who sees this Oneness (directly experiences it) – it is that person who truly sees. That being is the Seer who is the Witness – meaning: it is that person who is the Knower of Brahman."
6,"But, O Mahabaho [mighty-armed; Arjuna]! Sannyas [renunciation] without [spiritual] yoga brings about suffering. One who unites through karmayoga [practice of spiritual yoga] – that one becomes “muni” [sage] and quickly realizes Brahman (“parmartha sannyas” [ending oneself in the Supreme Truth]).","It is true all right that the result of both sannyas [renunciation] and yoga  [spiritual practice] are the same, but sannyas does not happen without the performance of yoga. This is because the only way to purify the chitta [heart; personal consciousness] is through [spiritual] yoga. If someone takes up sannyas without having performed yoga, then that person becomes helplessly pulled to the worldly experience. Because the vrittis [functionalities] of the sense-tendencies all remain strong, nothing at all gets renounced. But if one becomes spiritually engaged through yoga, as the mind goes to Kutastha and realizes the Kutastha Purush by seeing and knowing, everything quickly gets destroyed and one attains Settledness in Brahman. This Brahman is That Which is “sannyas” [where all ends] - “saṃnyAso brahma uchyate” [it is said that Brahman is “sannyas”]. (For as long as the chitta is not purified, for that long does karmayoga and sannyas remain different. Later both are known as one.) "
7,"Even if the yoga-united person, being purified in chitta, victorious over the body, victorious over the senses and seeing the same in all performs karma [actions], he/she does not become bound (by that).","The yoga-united sadhak – having followed the methods of the previous slokas and having attained Settledness in Brahman, and then coming down and again becoming yoga-united – becomes a being with a pure chitta – meaning: remains in the Pure “I” state. Because all of his karmas [actions and their fruits] are burned to ashes in the fire of gyana, he/she becomes victorious over the body (see Chapter 4, sloka 37 [of the Gita]). By following [the teaching] in sloka 39 of Chapter 4 [of the Gita], when all senses become completely controlled [or: one], that sadhak becomes victorious over the senses – meaning: even when coming into contact with the worldly experience, none of the sadhak's senses become attached to the worldly experience. And knowing all phenomena/beings including iconic pillars such as Brahmaa [creator aspect of the Hindu Trinity] within one's Self, that sadhak becomes all-seeing. For this reason, even if karma [actions] are performed due to the connection with prarabdha [karma to carry out the body], one does not become bound by that. When the chitta is purified by the Light of Consciousness, no imprint by worldly experiences is made ever again in the chitta."
"08,09","For the spiritually knowing yogi, because he/she sees that all of the sense-organs are carrying out their particular actions by themselves, even if that yogi does actions – such as seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, lying down (sleeping), letting go of the breath and drawing the breath, speaking words, eliminating, holding and the opening and closing of the eyes etc. - that yogi does not ever think that “I am doing something.”","The one who has known Truth, and is always enjoined to the State of the Self – because that being's chitta is completely pure, he/she never again has to become deluded in the “me and mine” of the Mayic creation. Thus, as the prarabdha experience plays out, all of the matters of the senses that take place such as seeing, hearing etc. - that sadhak has no sense of doership in that. The good and bad fruits of karmas that have to get carried out because of prarabdha happen only to the body. They cannot shake that sadhak's state of Profound Peace. Seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating – these are the activities of the five sense-organs of perception. Speaking, holding, moving, elimination of feces and urine – these are the activities of the five organs of action. Exhaling, inhaling, looking, closing one's eyes – these are the activities of the five pranas. Lying down (sleeping) is the activity of intellect in the inner senses. "
10,"One who performs all karma [actions] upon having offered them all to Brahman – like the lotus leaves on water [being above the water], is not touched by sin.","In slokas 6, 7 and 8 [of this Chapter 5] – being yoga-united, muni [sage], Brahman-sannyas [ending in Brahman], and then again being yoga-united and being a knower of Truth – these progressively ascending steps of sadhana that have been stated – one who has not yet followed that progression and has not yet become a knower of Truth – the procedure with which that sadhak should practice Kriya – that is being spoken about in this sloka – meaning: it is being said that that sadhak must cut off his/her connection with karma [actions] and act by offering [the actions] to Brahman. The space-filled canal that extends within the sushumna nadi going from the Muladhar to the Sahasrar – that is called “brahmanadi.” — Begin Footnote. — The brahmanadi, goes up within the vajrachitra [nadi] – which is within the sushumna [nadi] – and pierces all of the lotuses. Entering the mind within this [brahmanadi] is called “awakening the Kundalini Shakti.” When the mind enters into this [brahmanadi], the pure intellect comes forth. Whatever there is to be known is known. For this reason it [brahmanadi] is also called “gyana-nadi” [nadi of knowledge]. One mouth of this brahmanadi is at the Muladhar, and the other mouth bifurcates into two paths reaching the brahmarandhra in the Sahasrar [from two opposite sides] (see Illustration No. 2 [in the Introduction section of the Pranab Gita]). The mouth at the Muladhar is open. The mouth at the Sahasrar is closed. For the perfected person [realized being], the mouth at the Sahasrar opens up. That is what is called “the bursting open of the brahmarandhra.” When the brahmarandhra is burst open, there is “videhamukti” [Liberation after leaving the body/dying]. The three mouths of ida, pingala and sushumna [nadis] are all one at the Muladhar. — End Footnote. — The space filled canal between the ida and pingala [nadis] is called “brahmanadi.” Taking recourse in that brahmanadi, prana and apana go on sporting in all of the lotuses. For the sake of chitta-purification, all of the types of practices that Srigurudev gives to the disciples (whatever suits the particular person) – all of those practices have to be performed by moving prana upon taking recourse in that Sky of Brahman. This is that which is called “offering to Brahman.” Through those types of practices, as one goes farther and farther above in these three nadis – particularly in the sushumna nadi – many wondrous visions are seen, and different powers of the different locations come forth and provide places of abidance to bind the sadahak into enjoyments. Far be it to even talk about being entranced by those visions or resorting to any of those powers, one should completely ignore and abandon all of those and keep attention only on Kutastha; and doing “mAmanusmaraNa” [meditating on Me; meditating on the Self or the Lord] continuously, one has to go straight upward; one must not make contact with anything [on the way up]. This is that which is called “cutting of the connection” [see last line of above paragraph]. If one practices in this way, one does not have to be bound by sin – meaning: one does not have to fall to the bindings of restlessness-born karma. Just as the lotus flower is born in water, grows in water, does not get covered up by water even though it lives in water, and no marks from water remain on it – in the same way, the sadhak who has offered all karma [yogic practices] to Brahman and cut off all connection to karma [the fruits being experienced along the way], actually takes recourse in karma itself [spiritual action] and goes up to the field above. The sadhak goes through the worldly experience due to prarabdha by taking recourse in karma itself [spiritual action], and even as he/she does so, does not become bound by karma [actions and their fruits]."
11,"In order to do “atmashuddhi” [self-purification], the yogis renounce the craving for the outcome [of actions] and perform karma [spiritual actions] with the body, mind, intellect and the “kevala indriya[s]” [spiritual senses; see definition and explanation in the commentary].","[The kinds of practices associated with the methodology stated in the tenth sloka [of this Chapter 5] that the yogis do is the matter being stated in this sloka.] Due to the activities of the humors – “vayu” [air], “pitta” [bile] and “kapha” [phlegm] – all of the passageways of the nadis in the body remain closed. In that state, it is not possible to move prana in those passageways and rise up. All of those are physical impurities. Believing that the worldly experiences of sound, touch, sight, taste, smell and such are things of great delight, and thereby becoming addicted to them and being bound to such desires comprise the impurities of the chitta. If the impurities of the chitta are there, it is not possible to become established in the Self. For this reason, it is imperative to remove the impurities of the body and the chitta. This is that which is called “atmashuddhi” [self-purification]. For the sake of this “atmashuddhi,” the yogis follow the teachings of guru and perform many types of physical practices in the forms of asanas and mudras and such. As well: prana-Kriya adjoined with Atma-mantra, mantras to purify the ida and pingala, mantras to pierce the inner knots and such types of japa [repeated inner recitation] and invocations etc. - such types of mental practices are done. By using the intellect to be certain about different things which are sat [beneficent] or asat [maleficent], the yogis become “hṛdi sanniviShTa” [settled in the heart; or: experience the Self settled in the heart]. And entering the innermost space, through “kevala indriya[s]” [see explanation in the following sentence], the yogis do the practices related to the matters that are associated with them [such types of senses], such as the seeing, hearing and knowing of the Spiritual Truth in the forms of Naad, Bindu etc. All of the senses that have turned away from the outer-facing ways and face inward, and are free of “me-ness” are the “kevala indriya[s].” All of these practices that the yogis do – they do not keep any expectation of attaining outcomes. They simply carry out guru's teachings. If there is mental connection [to the practices] or desire, “atmashuddhi” [self-purification] does not come about."
12,"The united person, having abandoned [the expectations of] the fruits of actions, attains Steady Peace. The non-united person, being desirous and attached to the outcome of the fruits of actions, falls into the bondage of karma.","[The kinds of states that are attained by the sadhak by following the methodology stated in the 10th sloka [of this Chapter 5] and by doing the types of practices/works addressed in the 11th sloka [of this Chapter 5] – that is being spoken about in four slokas – 12 through 15 [of this Chapter 5] – meaning: first being “yukta” [united], then “naisthiki-shanti-prapti” [the attainment of Steady Peace], then being “vashi” [controlled], then being “prabhu” [controller; lord], and then becoming “vibhu” [all-pervading] and thereby being “agyana” [state of Not-Knowledge] (meaning: being absolutely complete, because of which one is devoid of all associations).] Offering karma [acts] to Brahman, and then performing [spiritual] yoga with body, mind, intellect and “kevala indriyas” [see commentary to sloka 5:11], all of the fruits of karmas become sacrificed in God (offered to Brahman). Then the sadhak becomes “yukta” [enjoined] - meaning: the four vrittis [functionalities] of his/her antahkarana become completely inward-faced and unite with Kutastha. (This is the Kriya of the “field of mind” within the sadhak. See the commentary in Chapter 4, sloka 7.) At this time, the sadhak goes straight up to Kutastha. No relation remains to that which is below, and the sadhak does not get pulled in any way by the powers that are below. The Peace-filled Bliss that comes about when witnessing Spiritual Truth in this imperturbable state – that is “naishtiki-shanti” [Steady Peace]. This state of “naishtiki-shanti” is the Kriya of the intellectual field. Being purified in oneself in this state, it can be known and seen that if one is not able to be united – meaning: if one is not able to come to the Agya and become still – that Peace-filled state cannot be attained. This is because: in the non-united state (meaning: for as long as one is below the Agya – for that long), because one is drawn by desires rising from the rajoguna, one has to be bound due to attachment to the outcomes of karma [acts]; one loses the way; one cannot rise above."
13,"The embodied one, using the discerning intellect, casts off all karma [acts and their outcomes] and becomes “vashee” [controlled by the Self], and in the city of nine doors (in the body), abides in happiness, without doing anything and without causing anything to be done.","After the sadhak attains the state of “naishtiki-shanti,” he/she becomes a “samyami”-witness in an extremely subtle state of being (see Chapter 4, sloka 26). At this time, as the intelligence of the Self dawns, all karma is renounced – meaning: along with the destruction of activities of the mind's volition, all of the prana-Kriyas of the six chakras also fall off. Thus: two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, mouth, anus and the sex organ – all of the activities of these nine doors of the body stop and the relationship to the external worldly experience is completely finished off. Then the sadhak becomes “vashee” [controlled by the Self]. (This is the Kriya of the “I”-field.) At this time, because of the extinguishing of the two vrittis of volition and certainty, even while residing in the body, the sadhak has no activities remaining at all. There is only the abidance in happiness – meaning: abidance in the Revelatory Light in the Beautiful Space, in the Bliss of the Self. [This is the state of “vijitatma” [victorious over oneself; in the commentary to 5:7, the words “victorious over the body” is used] as stated in sloka 7 [of this Chapter 5].]5 Although there is no activity in the state of being “vashee,” the power of activity and the full knowledge of “I” or the knowledge “ahang” [or: ahaṃ] remains."
14,"“Prabhu” [Lord] (“Ishvara” [God]) does not create the doership of the planes, does not create the actions, and does not create the connection of the fruits of actions either. All of this is carried out through [the Self's] “Svabhava” [Nature]. ","After being “vashee” [see sloka 5:13], the sadhak rises up to the field of the chitta and becomes “prabhu” [lord] (truly still). At that time, only the vritti of contemplation is present, and because the sadhak is without ego, he/she becomes all-knowing! Among the 24 substances of Prakriti, this is the state of Supreme Primacy for Consciousness/Spirit; that is why He is “prabhu” (“Ishvara” [God])! At this time, the sadhak sees oneself and realizes that the sadhak is no longer under the power of Prakriti. Prakriti Herself is under the power of the sadhak. It is by taking recourse in the Self that Prakriti is playing Her Sport. All of the doership, actions, and the connection to the fruits of actions that take place in the fourteen planes — Begin Footnote. — The seven chakras from the Muladhar to the Sahasrar are indeed the seven heavens. And the tips of the big toes, the two ankles, the insteps [alternate translation: the shin area], the knees, the thighs and the pelvis are the seven patalas [underworlds]. The active properties of these can be known through the sadhana as instructed by guru.] — End Footnote. — such as “Satya[loka]” and such – the Self does not do them. It is simply the Witness. Prakriti is actually taking recourse in the Self and doing all of those things. This Prakriti is the Self's “Svabhava” – meaning: the Self's Own Nature or State. This “Svabhava” is of two types: free and controlled. For as long as the Consciousness-Spirit does not cross the field of “I,” for that long is that Svabhava free. Consciousness is controlled in Her Womb. It is in this state that Prakriti is the Mother; the jiva is the offspring. When that Consciousness-Truth is in the state of Ishvara [God], at that time the Svabhava is controlled; Consciousness is Lord over Her. It is in this state that Prakriti is the “Ramani” [Lover; Delighter] and Ishvara is “Swami” [Husband/Beloved; Lord]. When one can rise up to the “prabhu” state through the power of sadhana, the truth of the statement “janani ramani, ramani janani” [mother is the lover/delighter, lover/delighter is the mother] can be known. All powers of activities dissolve in the state of “prabhu.” Only the state “I am indeed 'I'” remains. Nothing else at all remains. This is the state of “jitendriya” [victorious over the senses] that is stated in the seventh sloka [of this Chapter 5]. "
15,"“Vibhu” [the all-pervading] does not take the sin of anyone, and does not take the virtue of anyone either. “gyana” is covered by “agyana.” It is for that reason that all living beings are in delusion.","After the state of “prabhu,” the sadhak becomes “vibhu” [all-pervading] – meaning: having become universe-pervading, one becomes endowed with the totality of Consciousness. This is verily the “state beyond all gunas” - the State of Shiva. This is indeed the “all phenomena/beings being within one's Self” stated in the 7th sloka [of this Chapter 5]. This is still a “state.” That is because: although at this time the Consciousness-Truth has gone beyond the chitta or the Mahattattva, because one is still in the place where Avyakta and chitta are, a little bit of contact with error remains. At this time, sin and virtue – meaning: pravritti and nivritti [respectively] – all run out. There is nothing to take [or: take up]. This is because: as Consciousness leaves the Maya-enjoying state to the state of being beyond Maya, all Mayic and Prakritic activities dissolve. This “vibhu” state also dissolves very quickly. Then all states end. That is a state with no state. It is up to this point of the “vibhu” state that Knowledge remains. It cannot go beyond this. With all states being extinguished, Knowledge is also extinguished. When that “agyana” [Not-Knowledge] state comes about, the “janmavah” - meaning: all of the functionalities of the sense organs under the powers of creation, preservation and destruction become “deluded” - meaning: they become inactive, and cease into inertness. — Begin Footnote. — This “agyana” [non-Knowledge] state that happens – in this, all of these vrittis [functionalities] become inactive and inert, [but] they do not dissolve. This is because the body remains. Unless the body is cast off, there is no dissolution of the universe – meaning: all of the vrittis. This state of “agyana” for sure happens as the final stage of sadhana, [but] it [also] happens to all jivas at death. Just as: when asampragyata samadhi breaks and the sadhak comes down to the worldly experience and thereby all of the vrittis become active – in the same way, after death, when the jiva takes on a new body, all of the vrittis of the previous life manifest one after another. The difference between the “agyana” [ignorance] of death and the “agyana” [Not-Knowledge] of samadhi is this: the body is left behind at death; during samadhi, the body does not die. At death, the jiva remains under the control of Prakriti. In samadhi, one becomes free. At death, the non-sadhak and the fallen yogi-sadhak rely on “knowingness.” In samadhi, there is no reliance on anything. One becomes free of reliance and attains Nirvana-Emancipation.  — End Footnote. —"
16,"But, for those for whom that agyana [see sloka 5:15] is destroyed through the Knowledge of the Self, that Knowledge of the Self shines forth like the sun being revealed (revealing oneself and revealing others), and thus reveals the Supreme Truth.","After that all-extinguishing state (samadhi) breaks and one comes down to the state of “prabhu” [see sloka 5:15] – the Knowledge of the Self that manifests at that time – that is brilliantly luminous like the sun. In that, knowledge and that which is to be known, and every atom and particle of the universe in the form of this body are directly known. The past and the future are revealed as if they are in the present. — Begin Footnote. — In the 6th sloka, by saying “sannyas does not happen without yoga,” the Lord showed that only after becoming yoga-united can one quickly go beyond all substances and attain Brahman. And, because the body has not yet expelled its very last breath – when, for natural reasons, the sadhak comes down to the realm of substances, then the sadhak becomes “tattvavit” [knower of truths] (in sloka 8). [At this time] the fives states – being yoga-united, purified in oneself, victorious over oneself, victorious over the senses, and seeing all phenomena/beings within the Self – come together in the sadhak all at the same time. But at the time of ascending in sadhana, these five states manifest separately and one after the other. After explaining the fruits of yoga in a simple way in slokas 6 and 7, in order to explain to Arjuna (to the sadhak) all of those [matters] in a more explicit way, the Lord spoke about the methodology and the types of the steps of ascension in slokas 10 and 11. And in slokas 12 to 15, He described those [aforementioned] five states separately. Thus, the “tattvavit” [knower of Truth] state of sloka 8 is the same as the state described in this sloka 16. It is in this state that the sadhak is Ishvara [God]! However, the difference between the sadhak's “god-ness” and the Lord of the universe's “God-ness” is this: the sadhak is the god of this microcosm; the Lord of the Universe is the God of the macrocosm. The five-element-created external universe does not get resolved with the attainment of union with the Supreme by the sadhak; that [universe] remains within the existence of the five elements. But when the resolution is done by the Lord of the Universe, everything is resolved. — End Footnote. —"
17,"Those who keep their intellect in that sun-like Knowledge, who keep their chittas in that, those who are fully established in that, and those for whom that is the ultimate way – because their evils have been completely washed clean by that Knowledge, they attain the destination of no return. ","[Those who do sadhana in the previously mentioned ways – what their final attainment is – that is what is being spoken about in this sloka.] During the practice of sadhana, the state that is there after asampragyata samadhi breaks – that is verily the state of being “jivanmukta” [Liberated while still living in the body] (enveloped in Awareness). At that time not a bit of “kashmal” [see Chapter 2, sloka 2] remains. At that time, everything is Knowledge/Awareness or Brahman. The intellect is Brahman; the chitta is Brahman; settledness is Brahman; going is Brahman. Thus, the sadhak is “jivanmukta.” For this reason, as soon as the body is discarded [as soon as physical death happens], one attains “videhamukti” [Emancipation after death], or the destination of no return."
18,"Those one's with gyana and with wisdom that is developed see the same [Reality] in a brahmin, a cow, an elephant, in a dog, and even in an outcaste. (They see the One Brahman equally in everyone.)","[Those who attain the destination of no return upon having attained the state of Knowledge – how they go about while living in samsara – that is what is being spoken about in this and the next sloka [4:18-19].] Those for whom the sun-like Knowledge is revealed – because they have the vision of “Brahman everywhere” established in them, they no longer see separation; they no longer have the perception of good and bad; the tension of purity and impurity is no longer there; all becomes One Brahman. The same Brahman that is a brahmin – that same Brahman is also a cow, an elephant, dog and even an outcaste. In their [the gyanis'] eyes, the Truth that “all is Brahman” is directly seen by them."
19,"Those pandits [wise ones] who see equally in all, those whose minds are established in equanimity – they conquer samsara even in the conditions of being a living being. They are residing in Brahman Itself, as the State of Equipoise without “dosha” [wrongness; error[s]] is verily Brahman.","When prana becomes still, the mind also becomes still. That is when “sama” [oneness] happens. When the sadhak stays in that “sama,” then that abidance is called “samadhi.” The “nirdosha” [no wrongness; error-free] state of this “sama-ness” is indeed Brahman. In the scriptures, attraction, repulsion, delusion [etc.] are called “dosha” [wrongness/error[s]]. The matters of sound, touch and such are the matters of those “doshas” as well. This is because the worldly experience itself is “dosha.” When the sadhak stills the mind and goes to take samadhi, if at that time the sadhak is not drawn by “vikarma” [that which brings one back to the worldly experience], then the sadhak's mind extinguishes in Consciousness. This extinguishing is indeed – this oneness is indeed “nirdosha” [no wrongness; error-free]. But, if at that time “vikarma” can come and attack the sadhak, then some kind of worldly matter of sound and touch and such awakens in the mind of the sadhak. At that time, the extinguishing happens while having attention on that worldly experience. Then that “samadhi” (being established in “sama”), instead of being “nirdosha,” is “sadosha” [with wrongness/error[s]]. This “sadosha” samadhi is not of Brahman. Those who are spiritual seers – their samadhi is “nirdosha.” Thus, they are established in Brahman – meaning: they have attained Brahman-ness. Even if they come down to experience the world because of the influence of prarabdha, they do not see the experiences of the world as separate from Brahman. For them, everything is verily Brahman. This is why they are “sargajit” [victorious over creation] even in the conditions of being a living being. The body of the jiva is indeed “sarga” [creation]. For as long as the jiva is alive, for that long, because of the vanity of the body being there at that time, does the jiva become overcome by the body-oriented pleasures and pains due to the contact with the worldly experience and the sense-organs. But after leaving the body at death, the jiva no longer has that vanity and does not experience the pleasures and pains. Then the jiva's attachment to the body ceases. Just like that, those who become endowed with the state of gyana, because their body-vanity has completely gone away and as they are abiding in Brahman-ness, no aberrations such as pleasure and pain arise in their minds even with the contact of the worldly experience and the sense-organs. Even in the state of being alive, they unperturbedly remain in the Bliss of Brahman. That is why they are “victorious over creation.”"
20,"The one who is the knower of Brahman – that one is of steady intellect, free of delusion, [and] remains verily in Brahman. For this reason, that person does not become joyous upon receiving a dear thing, nor does he/she become upset by having something unpleasant happen.","[The one who abides in Brahman-ness – what are the signs of that person – that is what is being spoken about in this sloka.] Ordinary people, and those who have not become perfected through sadhana – all of the things that those people feel as beneficent or maleficent – the knower of Brahman does not become joyous or sorrowful when those things come about at the time of “prarabdhabhoga” [fulfillment of prarabdha karma]. — Begin Footnote. — All that has to be done while living in the world – going on doing that without any agenda is called “prarabdhabhoga” [the fulfillment of prarabdha karma]. — End Footnote. — That sadhak's intellect remains in Brahman, unmoving and unshakeable. Thus, that sadhak is free of delusion. That being is “agAdha buddhirakshuddhah” [with intellect in fathomless serenity]. "
21,"The person whose heart is not addicted to the external worldly experience only enjoys whatever happiness comes from the Self. After that, that person becomes one with Brahman and enjoys Unending Happiness.","[In order to instruct the sadhak about the reason for a knower of Brahman to be of steady intellect and be free of delusion, it is being stated in this sloka that the person devoid of addiction to the worldly experience becomes one who is at peace, and attains Unending Happiness.] After the body and mind become purified through the Kriyas of pranayam and such, the mind leaves the external worldly experiences of sound and touch and such and enters within. Then the eyes do not want to look [outside] any more. The mind does not feel like going to anything outside. The addiction [to external things] also does not remain. This state is had with just a little sadhana. At this time, upon looking at the happenings at Kutastha, the mind, life-force, senses – all become enraptured in Bliss. This is that which is called “the enjoyment of happiness from the Bliss of the Self.” The one who has known this happiness, only that person knows. — Begin Footnote. — “hantAtmagyasya dheerasya khelato bhogaleelaya na hi saṃsAravAheekairmoodhaih saha samAnata yat padaṃ prepsavo deenAh shakrAdyAh sarvadevatAh aho tattra sthito yogee na harShamupagacchati” ashtAvakra saṃhitA (4:1-2) [“Oh, the wise and settled knower of the Self, playing the sport of enjoyments, has no similarity whatsoever to the deluded beasts of samsara Oh [or: truly], the yogi does not feel elated even when abiding in the state hankered after disconsolately by the gods from Indra onwards” Ashtavakra Samhita [a spiritual treatise] – Chapter 4, slokas 1-2] — End Footnote. — That is not something to be explained by language. After this state, the process stated in sloka 25 of Chapter 4 [of the Gita] begins – meaning: the sadhak offers oneself in the Fire of Brahman and attains Brahman-samadhi. The current that goes on flowing in the chitta after enjoying this samadhi – that is known as “Brahmananda” [the Bliss of Brahman]. Whoever experiences this Bliss of Brahman just once, that person's mind/heart no longer is attracted to the worldly experience; that person just stays intoxicated in that Bliss [of Brahman]. And that never ends. Thus, that person enjoys Unending Happiness. It is for this reason that the knower of Brahman does not become deluded by the dear and not-dear experiences of the world. Therefore, dear sadhak! You too withdraw all of your senses from the external worldly experience. This hint is being given."
22,"All of the enjoyments/partakings of the worldly experience that have emerged from the contact with the senses – they are all causes of sorrow/pain, and have beginnings and ends ([are] impermanent). O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! That is why the discriminating person does not become addicted to all such enjoyments/partakings.","Sound, touch, sight, taste, smell – these five matters of the worldly experience – all of these are experienced by eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin – these five sense-organs. Each of the senses have a limit in regards to the capacity of how much of the enjoyment of the worldly experience they can have. As soon as that limit is crossed, then there is no pleasure from that [experience] any more; pain comes forth. It is like: when the mouth has had enough of eating “sandesh” [a sweetmeat], one cannot eat any more “sandesh”; indigestion happens; headache ensues; one suffers. That is how it goes. In creation, this is a fixed process! That is why it is being said that the pleasures from the enjoyment of worldly experiences are by nature of short duration and, in the end, bring about pain. And more, when one is addicted to the enjoyment of worldly experiences, the spiritual strength of the mind (to rise in the direction of the Self) becomes powerless – meaning: the power by which the Supreme Self can be experienced, that power diminishes; the inner sky becomes covered. But the happiness that comes forth within after disengaging from the enjoyments of external worldly experiences – that has no end. Even if that happiness is enjoyed for infinity, no aberration happens to that. It is for this reason that the discriminating person does not become addicted to the pleasures of the worldly experience."
23,The human being that has the capability to withstand the forces of desire and anger – that is the one who is “yukta” [united]; that is the one who is “sukhee” [happy].,"Happiness is the human being's main aim. In that area, the happiness of the worldly experience is impermanent and the cause of pain, and the Happiness of the Bliss of the Self is Unending. Therefore, the Happiness of the Bliss of the Self is the Supreme Spiritual Goal. But desire and anger are in the way of the attainment of the Supreme Spiritual Goal (obstacles). The deluding power or the attraction of the worldly experience is desire itself. When there is opposition to this desire (resistance), it changes to anger. (See Chapter 3, sloka 37 [of the Gita].) Desire and anger attack the sadhak both inside and outside. The one who, while being in contact with the worldly experience during the waking state, is not enraptured by the matters of enjoyment, and is not perturbed by the lack of the matters of enjoyment, whether in health, illness and all conditions, all the way until death – that is the one who is happy. This is the matter of the external experience. Similarly, inside: during the practice of guru-instructed Kriya, for as long as the mind stays in “iha” [this] – meaning: in the five elements, for that long, along with all of the vrittis of mind becoming extremely subtle, the force of that desire and anger becomes strong, and they stealthily attack the mind. The one who, in this state, until the point of piercing the Agyana-chakra and getting into Kutastha (prAk shareeravimokshaNAt [before the “body's” emancipation]), takes recourse in discrimination and detachment and is able to withstand that force, is able to keep attention on Kutastha without wavering, and is not disturbed even a little bit – it is that one who is “yukta” [united]; it is that one who is “sukhee” [happy] – meaning: that being is yoga-united, and attains Shelter in the Beautiful Sky of Consciousness."
24,"The one whose happiness is in the Self alone, whose comfort is in the Self alone, and who sees only the Self – meaning: the one who does not take anyone other than the Self in the antahkarana [inner consciousness] – that yogi becomes established in Brahman and attains “Brahman-Nirvana” (“Kaivalya Mukti” [Emancipation]).","It is not enough to just bear the force of desire and anger. The one who, via the inner perception, witnesses the True Form of Consciousness upon having entered Kutastha, and thereby experiences happiness – meaning: becomes joyful – later, upon becoming devoid of fickleness, that sadhak receives comfort – meaning: becomes Still. And, with the aid of the Light of Consciousness, that sadhak cuts through whatever is seen via the subtle sight. That sadhak's intellect becomes subtle, extremely subtle, and even more subtle than that and merges into the Infinite. Everything becomes extinguished. The sadhak, as well, merges into Brahman and becomes Brahman. This is the attainment of “Brahman-Nirvana” by the yogi. "
25,"The sages who are sinless, devoid of conflict, fully renunciate, and meditate for the beneficence of all beings attain Brahman-Nirvana.","Showing how the yogi attains Brahman-Nirvana in the previous sloka [5:24], the Lord is speaking about the matter of the attainment of Brahman-Nirvana by the sannyasi [renunciate]. The one who, through the performance of [spiritual] yoga renounces all karma and becomes “sage” - meaning: sees Oneness in all – it is that person who is “sannyasi” [one for whom all has ended]. That sadhak sees Brahman in everything, all the way to the source of creation itself. Thus, that being does not have any “kalmasha” - meaning: doubt. And again, as that sadhak's chitta is always in the unshakeable and united state of Brahman-ness, that sadhak is fully renunciate. And being full of benevolence, that sadhak brings blessings to all living beings – meaning: just by seeing that sadhak, the jiva experiences peace in the heart. And that being's teachings bring about the attaining of wisdom; maleficence is removed. Spending their time like this, the sannyasis attain Brahman-Nirvana."
26,"Brahman-Nirvana prevails in both the states of life and death for the sannyasis who are with disciplined chitta that is free of desire and anger, and who see Oneness in all.","The sannyasi who is endowed with the [previously mentioned] qualities – that  sannyasi is “jivanmukta” [Liberated while living in the body]. Liberated in this life – meaning: because of abiding in Brahman, that being has no erroneous contact, and Free in death as well – meaning: immediately upon death, that sadhak attains the destination of no return, or the Supreme Destination. Those qualities such as freedom from desire and anger etc. cannot be attained at all without karmayoga [yogic practice]. In order to make that clear, the Lord has elucidated all of those particular characteristics of sannyasis. For this reason, He is speaking in an expanded way about karmayoga in the next sloka. “Viditatma” [knowing the Self] – meaning: merging with the Self – like the union of the flame with the Flame."
"27,28","Removing all of the worldly experiences of sound and touch and such, establishing the eyes in the middle of the eyebrows, one who merges prana and apana through the nose and brings the senses, mind and intellect under control, and who becomes devoid of desire, fear and anger, and thereby becomes “muni” [sage] by taking shelter in Liberation – that being is Ever-Free.","[The Lord has been saying all along that Liberation is possible through karmayoga [spiritual practice]. That is why, after showing the end result of both yoga and sannyas to be the same – Brahman-Nirvana, He is now specifically speaking about the “dhyanayoga” [yoga of meditation] within karmayoga [spiritual practice].] To not think about worldly experiences is the “removing of the worldly experience within.” This is because if one thinks, the worldly experience enters within. Exactly in the middle of the two eyebrows – where the [symbolic or decorative] spot is placed – one has to still one's sight there. That is what is called “keeping the eyes in the middle of the eyebrows.” At that time, through the guru-instructed method, — Begin Footnote. — “Apana” - meaning: the vayu [vital air] that has the movement of going outside – upon drawing that inward “purak” [deep inhalation; “filling”] (pulling it), because [by doing that] the place of prana becomes contracted, prana automatically falls into apana and, with both of them merging, become yogically united. This is that which is called offering the “havan” [offering into ritual fire] or oblation of prana into apana. Similarly, with the “rechak” [long exhalation] breath, the “havan” of apana into prana takes place. That work should not be done from seeing it in a book. It also should not be done by dressing oneself up as one's own guru. (See the commentary in Chapter 4, sloka 29 [of the Pranab Gita].)  — End Footnote. — prana and apana are merged. When prana and apana are merged, the “yatendriya manobuddhi” [subjugated senses, mind and intellect; see first line of above sloka] etc. come about spontaneously. (One who practices Kriya will know all of those states by him/herself.) In those states, one becomes “muni” [sage; realized being] – meaning: mind becomes merged in the Substance. It is then that the sadhak becomes a “siddhayogi” [perfected yogi]. When such perfection happens, then, in all states – waking, dreaming, deep sleep, samadhi – the sadhak lives in Brahman-ness. Therefore, the sadhak is Ever-Free."
{29}{stop},"In that way, knowing Me as the enjoyer of the offerings of yagyas [fire sacrifices] and austerities, as the Highest God, and residing in the hearts of all beings, one attains Peace.","[It is not so that one becomes a muni [realized being] just by doing Kriya according to the previous sloka. Knowledge is necessary. If there is no knowledge, then the result of that [previously mentioned] pranayam will be the magic kumbhak [breath-retention] of magic-show-people. That is why He [Sri Krishna] is speaking about that knowledge in this sloka.] When, upon being in samadhi, the yogi sees and understands that all of the yagyas [sacrificial fire ceremonies] and austerities that are performed – that (Narayana) Vishnu is verily the enjoyer of those, all of the mantras such as “bhur bhuvah” etc. that people offer when one becomes established in the rites – [the yogi sees that] the Lord Vishnu Himself is the actual director of all of those [acts]. And it is That Vishnu Himself Who is presiding within every living being (within the heart) in the form of the Self, and the “I” is the All-pervading Vishnu. It is then that the sadhak becomes all-pervading and merges into Vishnu. The sadhak attains Peace, Liberation."
