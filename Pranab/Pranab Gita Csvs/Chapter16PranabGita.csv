"01,02,03","O Bharat [Arjuna]! Fearlessness, cheerfulness of mind/heart, abidance in jnana-yoga, charity, self-control, yajna [rites], study of the Vedas, disciplined spiritual practice, righteousness, non-aggression, truthfulness, non-anger, renunciation, peace, non-slanderousness, mercifulness towards all beings, non-lustfulness, gentleness, modesty, being without inconsistent behavior, strength, forgiveness, forbearance, cleanliness, non-malice, and being free of vanity – all of these are the endowments of the “daivas” [divinely oriented beings] who are born to go in the direction towards the Divine.","The statement that was made in the final sloka [verse] of the previous chapter [Chapter 15 of the Bhagavad Gita] – “etabuddhvA buddhimAn syAt kṛtakṛtyashcha bhArata” [having awakened to this, one becomes wise and fulfills what has to be done, O Bharat [Arjuna]] – its clear purport is being shown here – meaning: the natures of the “rakshasas [monstrous beings] and “asuras” [demonic beings] that have been spoken about in the 12th sloka of the 9th Chapter [of the Bhagavad Gita] are those that cause delusion and bondage to the world. And the “daivi/daivic” [divinely oriented] natures spoken about in the 13th sloka of that chapter [9] bring Liberation. How are the characteristics of the divine and demonic natures? That is being stated.

“Abhayam” – means “fearlessness.” Fear is only of death. When the jiva [soul] knows, through the power of sadhana, that “I Am the Supreme Person,” then that being no longer has the fear of death. When in the inner being, during the time that the mutations of Maya such as deceit etc. arise, one behaves from purity anyway, it is then that that state of being can be called “satvasvamshuddhi” [purity of being]. (Chapter 14, sloka 2 [of the Bhagavad Gita].) The peaceful contentment (state of restfulness) that comes about upon knowing the object of knowledge – that is verily “jnana” [knowing]. (See Chapter 9, sloka 1; Chapter 13, slokas 7 through 11; and Chapter 14, sloka 6 [of the Bhagavad Gita].) And the Stillness after the stoppage of the fluctuations in consciousness is called “yoga.” In these two, steadfastness is present. That is why the steadfastness in jnana and yoga is called “jnanayoga vyavasthiti” [the natural settledness in jnana-yoga [or: the natural settledness in jnana and yoga]]. To donate lawfully earned wealth to worthy recipients is called “daan” [charity]. (See Chapter 10, sloka 5 [of the Bhagavad Gita].) “Dama” [self-control] – the stopping of outward-going tendencies. “Yajna” [spiritual act] – yogic act [alternate translation: Kriya yoga] performed as stated in “shruti” [Vedas and Upanishads] and “smriti” [all other scriptures]. To understand the meanings of Vedas and such [scriptures] is called “svadhyaya” [spiritual study]. “Tapah” [disciplined spiritual practice] – to move the antahkarana [mind as a whole] in the True Way through special Kriya. “Arjava” – being clear and simple.
 
“Ahimsa” – in the waking, dream and deep sleep states, the absence of the tendency to cause harm to living beings (Chapter 10, sloka 5 [of the Bhagavad Gita]). “Satya” [truth] – the abandonment of falsehood. The non-arising of the desire to cause harm to others even after they have caused harm to oneself is called “akrodha” [non-anger]. “Tyaga” [renunciation] –  non-attachment. The repose that is in the full withdrawal from Prakritic activities is that which is called “shanti” [peace]. “Apaishunam” – the abandonment of derisive thoughts and speech towards others. Doing things for the beneficence of beings is called “daya” [compassion]. “Alolupata” – being without lustfulness. “Mandarva” – being devoid of guile. The tendency that automatically rises in opposition to, as well as to stop, an evil tendency that has risen, and the feeling of repentance that comes about because of that – that is that which is called “hree” or “modesty.” Not showing any more emotion than is needed for a situation is called “achapalata” [not having excessive agitation].
 
“Tejah” – strength. Even at the time of death, not doing the abominable (shameful) – meaning: not doing any act at the time of death for which one will have to endure derision. “Kshama” [forgiveness] – disregarding harmful acts done by another, even if one has the power to take revenge. “Dhriti” – the power of forbearance. “Shaucha” [purity] – stillness of mind (Chapter 10, sloka 7 [of the Bhagavad Gita]). “Adroha” [non-malice] – abandoning the desire to inflict harm on others. “Natimanita” [non-vanity] – not keeping the need to show others “how I am.”
 
The one for whom these [qualities] are ever-present in their inner being, O Bharat [Arjuna; the sadhak] – that is the one who is said to be born with the endowments of “daivas” [divinely minded beings]."
4,"Hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, cruelty and lack of discrimination – these are the endowments of those born in the direction of the “asuras” [the demonic]. ","“Dambha” [hypocrisy] – showing religiosity because of the hankering to have respect, or deceiving others with the performance of dutiful acts. “Darpa” – showing arrogance. “Abhimaan” [vanity] – for the littlest of reasons, showing extreme sadness, envy, being unfeeling or feeling offended – [being like this] in regards to wealth, education, lineage, relations etc. When desire is unfulfilled, the tendency that rises in the inner being – that is that which is called “krodha” [anger]. “Parushya” – rudeness (harshness). However something is, perceiving that as the opposite is called “ajnanata” [being ignorant]. O Arjuna! These are the endowments of those who are born in the direction of “asuras” [those of demonic nature]."
5,"It is said that the divinely oriented endowments bring Liberation, and that the demonic endowments lead to bondage. O Pandava [Arjuna]! Do not grieve/worry. Your birth is of the divinely endowed.","The jivas [souls] who are beings of divine endowments attain Liberation. Those who are beings of demonic endowments get choked in the bondage of Maya. At this time, as the question “with which kinds of endowments am I?” has arisen in the inner being of the sadhak, the sadhak is answering the question with his/her own Self-Knowledge. O Pandava [Arjuna; sadhak]! There is no need to grieve/worry any more. (In this place [of the Bhagavad Gita], Arjuna’s despondency from the first chapter [of the Bhagavad Gita] is dispelled.) You are born as one with divine endowments. Therefore, your Emancipation is inevitable. "
6,O Partha [Arjuna]! There are two types of beings in this world - “daiva” [spiritual] and “asura” [demonic]. [The nature of] the daivas have been extensively stated. (Now) hear from Me [about] asuras. ,"Whatever kinds of “bhootas” (living beings) there are in this world of people – among them, there are two types of “sarga[s]” (characteristic natures). One is the nature of the daivas [divinely oriented] and the other is the nature of “asuras” [demonically oriented]. The two natures – monstrous and asuric [demonic] – [spoken about] in Chapter 9, sloka 12 [of the Bhagavad Gita] are being addressed here as a single term called “asuri sarga” or [asuric] nature. These two sargas [the daivic [divinely oriented] and asuric [demonic] natures] were referred to previously as “endowments.” The endowments of the daivas bring about Liberation; therefore, they are enlivening and should be had. The endowments of the asuras bring about bondage; therefore, they are repulsive and should be abandoned. The endowments that are “daivic” – [meaning:] the ones that make the human be endowed with godly nature – that has been spoken about extensively in the entire [Bhagavad] Gita – meaning: the signs of the ones with steady-consciousness in the second chapter, the signs of devotees in the twelfth chapter, the signs of knowledge in the thirteenth chapter, the signs of Purush beyond the three gunas in the fourteenth chapter, and [the signs of the daivic beings] in slokas 1 to 3 of the sixteenth chapter have been explained. And the endowments that are asuric [demonic] – the ones that make the human be endowed with asuric nature and monstrous nature – meaning: those that are therefore to be abandoned – it is necessary to know those. That is why the Lord is now describing them. "
7,"Persons who are endowed with the natures of the asuras do not know pravritti [endeavors] or nivritti [repose]. (Thus) they do not have purity, nor good behavior, not even truth.","The steadfastness of sadhana [spiritual practice] that is needed in order to attain the State of the Supreme Person or to regain Brahman-ness – that is that which is called “pravritti” [spiritual endeavor] (“pra” = all-ness + “vritti” [movement]). And the everlasting repose that there is after attaining Brahman-ness – that is verily “nivritti” [repose]. Where even the cause of “vrittis” [movements; functionalities; tendencies] cannot rise – that is verily the state of “nivritti” [“non-vritti”]. Both of these are lacking in the inner selves of those who are beings with asuric endowments. What pravritti and nivritti are – they do not even know that. “Shaucha” [purity] – see the commentary to Chapter 10, sloka 8 [of the Pranab Gita]. “Achaar” [good behavior] – doing bathing, ablutions and such. “Upaneeya guruh shiShyaṃ shikshayet shauchamAditah; AchAramagnikaryaṃcha sandhyopAsanameva cha” [having performed the rite of initiation, the teacher must first instruct the pupil to have purity and such, and the conducting of the fire-rites and of the twilight devotions]. “Satya” [truth] – beneficence of others. In the inner selves of the asuras – “shaucha,” “achaar,” “satya” – none of these three are there."
8,"They [the asuras] say that the world is without truth, without basis, without God, and exists without [divine] causation. There is no other cause for it [the world] but lust.",The way that things are going and happening – I see that this world is really like this. There is no righteousness or unrighteousness. There is nothing called truth or God either. The world rises only because of the intercourse between male and female. The purpose of this world is to take care of the body and enjoy. This is the perspective in the minds of the asuras.
9,"Ruined/corrupted in their selves and being of small intelligence, and (those asura-natured people), as they have this kind of perspective (of doing cruel deeds and being enemies to the world), are born to destroy. ","Those asura-natured people are “nashtatmaat” – meaning: being without sattva guna and being locked in the rajas-tamoguna, the Infinite, Non-diminishing Self does not get revealed in their personal consciousness. They are of corrupted character. Thus, there is “alpabuddhi” [little intelligence] in them. The thing that runs out because of experiencing it – that is “alpa” [little]. That which does not run out – that is “ananta” [endless]. In comparison to the Self, this body is little. Not being able to cognize “I am the Self,” they have the perspective of “the body is me,” and thus become ever engaged in the body’s pleasure and service. Because this “I am the body idea” is fully present in them, they are “of little intelligence.” They, being of this kind of “little intelligence,” think that this world has come about through the intercourse of female and male, that the cause [of the world] is only lust, that there is no other cause for it – taking up this kind of view – meaning: they go on to see the world through this kind of perception. Having fallen to this way of having corrupted character, little intelligence and lustfulness, they do not believe in the afterworld or in spiritual ways. Thus, they become engaged in many types of cruel and ruthless acts, and act to bring suffering to the world (to ordinary living beings). Thus, they are born for the destruction of the world. Death is the destruction of the world – meaning: they die again and again in life; they experience only the ever-appearing birth and death. They do not get delivered from this. (See slokas 19 and 20 later [in this Chapter 16 of the Pranab Gita].) "
10,"(They), having taken recourse in insatiable lust, having become filled with hypocrisy, arrogance and indulgence, being filled with delusion (“by worshiping this god with this mantra, I will get great treasures” and such ways), taking up all sorts of wrong wants (things such as liquor and meat etc.), and having fallen to impure disciplines, proceed to (worship small gods and such).","“AsadgrAha” [wrongful wants] – those wants or desires that are “asat” [wrong] – meaning: that do harm and are blocks on the path of Emancipation – like: “perfecting such and such mantra, I will learn how to stupefy, enslave, cause mental disturbance to others etc.; by worshiping such and such gods I will make enormous amounts of money and I will know everything; I will make the impossible possible etc.” – trying for these types of impermanent pleasures.
 
“AshuchivratAh” – those whose “vratas” [vows; disciplines] are impure. “Vrata” = discipline [or: vow; practice]. The discipline that needs to be practiced with diet and behavior and such in order to attain perfection in some matter – that is “vrata.” The kinds of diet and behavior that make sattva guna grow, by which peaceful power gathers in the heart, the mind is purified and abandons restlessness, and thus the mind becomes able to attend to beneficent things – that is “shuchi vrata” [discipline of purity]. And the kinds of diet and behavior that make rajas and tamas gunas grow, by which restlessness and inebriation come to the mind, egotism is increased, and one does not have the ability to attend to beneficent things – that is “ashuchi vrata” [impure disciplines] – like rajasic and tamasic diet and behavior, etc.
 
Taking recourse in insatiable desires (like wanting to have the enjoyment of sensual pleasures through the worship of spirits, otherworldly beings, beings of ill repute), the wrongful things that are to be had by those who are filled with hypocrisy, arrogance and indulgence – they [the asura-natured] end up taking that. And they become adepts at the impure practices of consuming liquor and meat [and such]."
"11,12","Taking up endless and continuous anxiety-bringing concerns until the time of death, having succumbed to the enjoyments of lust, thinking that the enjoyment of lusts is the supreme purpose of life – being certain like this about [wrongful] deeds, those asuric people who have succumbed to lust and are bound by hundreds and hundreds of ties, in order to enjoy lusts, desire to gather masses and masses of wealth, even in wrongful ways.","By bringing a demi-god under my power through occult practices, I will build a city in the sky. And entering into water, land, the netherworld and the abyss of the Earth, I will endeavor greatly to enjoy sensual pleasures. Nurturing this kind of endless wanting, [the asuras] go on trying for these things and spend time like this until the end time of death. Being entangled in the snare of wishfulness (and failing again and again), and being in the states of lust and anger, in order to facilitate the enjoyments of lustful indulgence, [the asuras] endeavor to take from others (take others’ wealth), and engage in unrighteous and deceitful and such actions. "
"13,14,15,16","Today I have got this desired thing; (later) I will [again] get this (desired thing). I have this wealth, and again I will have this wealth. These enemies are killed by me. I will kill other enemies too. I am God. I am the enjoyer. I am perfected, powerful and happy. I have possessions such as wealth etc. and I am of high-birth. Who else is there like me? I will perform fire rites. I will give charity. I will have joy. Being deluded in ignorance like this, having their minds engaged in all kinds of matters, (all of those asuric people) become covered by the web of distorted delusion and addicted to the enjoyments of lusts, and thereby fall to malefic hells.","Today I got this; with this, I will fulfill such and such desire. I have this, and I will surely get this in the future. And then I will be known as wealthy. I have killed such and such enemies, and I will also kill so and so! I am God. I am the enjoyer. I am a perfected being. I am powerful. I am happy. Wealthy am I. Knowledgeable am I. Who else is there comparable to me? I can spend so much money in rites, fire ceremonies and pilgrimages! [The asuras] are deluded in this kind of ignorance. And they are covered by many other kinds of distortions of mind (having fallen into anxiety and such). And so, being addicted to the enjoyments of lustful indulgences that never become one’s own, thinking that they are one’s own and bowing to them in madness, [the asuras] remain engrossed in those kinds of thoughts, and due to being heavily habituated to that, the tendencies of lust arise at the time of death (“yA matih sA gathirbhavet” [as one thinks, so is one’s destiny]), and thereby [the asuras] fall (take birth) in malefic hells (in the wombs of those inclined to eating, sleeping, having sex and being afraid). All of these things are the play of the lower levels of mind, experiencing the samsara-hell."
17,"Obtaining respect for oneself [from others], not being gentle, and being proud and arrogant, they [the asuric natured], filled with hypocrisy, perform rites by name only and not according to injunctions. ","All of these asura people think, “No one has ever been born like me – I who am endowed with all great qualities.” They, filled with haughtiness of wealth and pride, do not believe in gurus; they do not want to bow to anyone. They conduct rites, but they do it to show people and buy reputation; they do not do so with faith/reverence. Bound by egotism, their rites are not performed according to injunctions. The prescribed sattvic-ness [peaceful purity] that is part of rites – they destroy that. They become doers of rites that are futile, and by name only. "
18,"Because of living with egotism, forcefulness, insolence, lust and anger,  and deriding others’ qualities, all of those asura people go about hating Me in their own bodies and others’ bodies.","All of those people of asuric natures, even though they are devoid of good qualities and are stupid, give themselves the high reputation of being knowledgeable and full of good qualities. They say wrongful things about the qualities of others on paths, and, taking recourse in the manifestations of the deepest ignorance – egotism, forcefulness, insolence, lust and anger – become the root cause of all useless things. What to say – they think that all of the women, men, animals and other living beings that have been born – that all of them have been created to do the jobs of providing enjoyments and pleasures for them [the asuras]. [The knowledge] that part of the same One Consciousness resides in the form of “I” in their own bodies and others’ bodies – they do not believe in that. They cannot even think about that. Thus, they hate the residing True “I” in their own bodies and others’ bodies. This is because all of these asura-natured people actually believe that the body is “I”, and their thinking is as if they are the body. That there is an independent Self besides the body, that That is what is meant by the word “I”, and that That “I” is presiding in every body in the same way – instead of [understanding] that, they cannot comprehend at all that nothing besides this body can be called “I”. Thus, whatever actions they take, they think like this: “I am the doer”; “I am the enjoyer.” The residing True “I” that is in their own bodies is hated. And thinking that everything is for their own pleasures, they manifest their hatred for the True “I” in others’ bodies by killing living beings or inflicting pain on living beings. That is why their ritual acts are not according to injunctions."
19,"I always place those cruel, wrongful, lowest of humans who hate Me into asuric wombs in samsara. ","“Aham” = Kutastha Chaitanya or Akshara Purush. This “aham” [“I”] is the knower of all fields. It is the same in everything. It hates no one, nor has anyone who is dear (Chapter 9, sloka [no sloka reference after the word “sloka” in the original]). It is the one who metes out the fruits of karma. Whatever the action of whoever is – It bestows the fruits according to that [action]. There is not a hair-breadth of exception. It is “sarvasA hṛdi saṃniviShTah” [resides in the hearts of all]. It is from It that memory, knowledge [arise] and both dissolve [in It] (Chapter 15, sloka 15 [of the Bhagavad Gita]). And It is the One Who, in the form of the All-ruling God, makes the jiva, [individual] who is locked in his/her habitual actions, carry out such actions (Chapter 18, slokas 60 and 61 [of the Bhagavad Gita]). Whatever action that the jiva starts – the mind is engaged in that action according to the obtained fruits of previous actions, bringing about good and bad fruits [in this act]. Similarly, at the time of death, in order to continue according to the karma [actions and their fruits] of that jiva, [the “aham”] makes the jiva remember the states according to that [habitual actions]. Whatever the state is that the jiva remembers at the time of death – that is the state that it later attains [after death]. If the State of the Self is remembered at the time of death, one becomes free of the rulership of Prakriti. Otherwise, one goes back and forth in the current of birth and death in the abyss of Prakriti. Meting out the fruits of actions in this way is the work of the Inner-residing God.

Now the thing is that the asura-natured people, being filled with the “I am the body idea,” become soul-haters, cruel and evil-doers. Thus, at the time of death, the Lord makes them remember the “body-state.” For this reason, they again have to take up a body in the birth-death-enjoined path of samsara. And again they become soul-haters, cruel and evil-doers. As this happens again and again, they gradually go lower and lower. They, being of horrifying, soul-hating natures, they gradually [descend] from human [incarnations] to wombs of tigers, snakes and such various asuric wombs. In this way, they experience the fruits of their own actions. "
20,"O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! (All of those) stupidly ignorant ones, because of attaining asuric wombs birth after birth, and not attaining Me, get destinies that are even lower.","O Kaunteya [Arjuna; the sadhak]! Because of not attaining “I”, those stupidly ignorant ones of asuric wombs go very far away from “I”, and, with the Light of “I” out of sight, go on again and again taking lower births of deeply tamasic [dark] nature, and thereafter become idiotic insects in hell. And they do not then have the ability to attain “I”."
21,"Lust, anger and greed – these are the three types of doors to hell, and they are harmful to the soul (they bring about births in low-level wombs). For this reason, abandon these three.  ","“Narak” [hell] (“na” = negation, “raṃ” = light, “kaṃ” = head) – the state in which there is no revelation of the Light of the Self in the head – that is “narak” [hell] – meaning: ignorance/unawareness, or being without discrimination/wisdom, is that which is “narak” [hell]. This hell – it has three doors. One is lust, another is anger, and another is greed. When one is enslaved by this lust-anger-greed, one gets that state of “narak.” And the soul is harmed – meaning: due to the covering up of Self-Knowledge, the individual soul descends to lower places. It takes birth in low-consciousness wombs. Therefore, know that these three active forces are to be abandoned by those longing for Liberation."
22,"O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! In order to be free from these three doors to hell, human beings take up the practice of doing what is good (beneficent) for themselves. And then they attain the Supreme Destination.","O Kaunteya [Arjuna; the sadhak]! By fully escaping these three – lust, anger and greed – one goes beyond Prakritic tamas [guna]. Then, upon obtaining the right to enter the sushumna [nadi], the Freely Manifesting Light of the Self is revealed. And because of practicing the yoga of the Self, one attains the best that there is – the Supreme Destination. The sadhak merges with Brahman and attains Brahman-ness. No more coming and going remain."
23,"One who abandons scriptural injunctions and does things [or: performs rites] according to one’s own whim – that one does not attain perfection, nor does that one attain happiness, nor does that one attain the Supreme Destination.","“Shastra” [scripture] means “the Vedas.” And “vidhi” [method] means “practice.” Religious work according to the procedures written in the Vedas, or practices [according to the Vedas] are called “shastravidhi” [according to the scriptural injunctions]. The knowledge of the seven stopping-places from the Muladhar to the Sahasrar – going upward: bhuh, bhuvah, svah mahah, janah, tapah, satyam – is called “Veda” [knowledge] (see commentary to Chapter 2, sloka 45 [of the Pranab Gita]). This Veda, or knowledge, brings about the upliftment of individual souls. Thus, the meaning of “shastravidhi” is: the method in the Vedas related to the upliftment of souls. Because the Vedas were recited by the mouth of [the creator] Brahmaa, the words of Brahmaa are known as “shastra” [scripture]. The creator Brahmaa comes into view from the Muladhar lotus to the sadhak’s [inner] eye. Right after creation, along with yajna [fire ceremony] [alternate translation: using “sahaj yajna” [natural/easy yajna]], his first directive to the living beings is: “devAn bhAvayatAnena te devA bhAvantu vah parasparaṃ bhAvayantah shreyah paramavApsyatha iShTAn bhogAn hi vo devA dAsyante yajnabhAvitAh tairdattAnapradAyebhyo yo bhungktestena eva sah” – [these are] slokas 11 and 12 of Chapter 3 [of the Bhagavad Gita]. This statement speaks about the “sahaj yajna” [natural or easy spiritual act] to be done by the jiva [individual]. This sahaj yajna – meaning: pranayam Kriya – has been explained in the commentary to those slokas [in the Pranab Gita]. This teaching is the method that is related to the upliftment of the soul. This is indeed according to scriptural injunctions.
 
The word “shastravidhi” has another meaning. That which rules/commands – that is that which is called “shastra” [commandments]. The governor that rules/commands within this body is “vayu” [vital-air]. It is because of vayu that the operations of the body are taking place. If vayu is a little bit “here and there” [not in a right way], the body does not remain. Thus, in the body, vayu is “shastra” [that which is the commander]. In the form of the life-force, vayu is sustaining the “jivan” [life] of the “jiva” [living being]. When this vayu’s Kriya is performed, upon it becoming equalized and subtle, it bestows knowledge to the jiva; it bestows Brahman-ness. And when this vayu is distorted, it makes the jiva mad – makes the jiva an insect of samsara.*2 Thus, if one is able to bring this vayu that is the ruler of the body under one’s control, the upliftment of the jiva’s soul happens. That is why, the methods that are there related to this vayu-Kriya – that is that which is called “shastravidhi” [an act according to scriptural injunctions]. This discipline is nothing but that directive of Brahmaa. Thus, whatever the meaning of “shastravidhi” may be, the result is the same. “Sahayajna” [yajna with; or: if seen as “sahaj-yajna” - natural/easy yajna], or the method of prana-Kriya is “shastravidhi” [according to the ruler; according to the scriptures]. This is the directive that flowed from the mouth of Brahmaa.

— Begin Footnote. — The human being, simply by being, is bound to “jaai” [“going-ness”] As one’s “jaai” (vayu [vital-air]) is – one performs actions according to that. Some people have the “jaai” to become sages; some have the “jaai” to become maleficent – and such types etc. This “jaai” is that which is called the tendency of mind, or pravritti [outward going tendencies]. — End Footnote. —

Because the Vedas are [still] of the matters of the three gunas, the Lord bestowed the teaching to Arjuna to go beyond the three gunas (see Chapter 2, sloka 45 [of the Bhagavad Gita]). [However,] in that teaching, the Lord did not say that one should ignore the injunctions of the Vedas. Vedic injunctions provide the only way to be beyond the three gunas. Just as light is the only way to see a desired thing in a dark room – similarly, the only way to be beyond the three gunas is through [following the] Vedic injunctions. Thus, one who abandons the injunctions of the scriptures and carries out the mentioned actions according to his/her own wishes – that one is deluded. That being’s accomplishments, happiness, Supreme Destination – none of that is attained. The Kriya of the six chakras is that which is called “Karmakanda” [section on spiritual acts] in the Vedas, and the Kriya of the Sahasrar is that which is called “Jnanakanda” [section on knowledge in the Vedas]. Unless one goes beyond these two parts/sections via sadhana [spiritual practice], one cannot attain the Non-tri-guna Substance beyond the three gunas. “One cannot eat grass by jumping over the horse” [Bengali colloquialism – meaning: one cannot secure the desired thing by avoiding that which has to be done].
 
In Chapter 3, slokas 11 and 12 [of the Bhagavad Gita], the method of prana-Kriya has been stated. Here, it is enough to say this much in summarized form: that at the time of drawing air in the body – meaning: at the time of inhalation, taking in fresh air from the space outside through the nasal passages and the cavity of the throat in the path of air to the Muladhar – by taking that vayu in the path of the chitta [personal consciousness] according to the teachings of guru, being vigilant to all of the shaktis, and then merging Param Shiva with Kulakundalini, and then exhaling in the opposite operation and re-establishing that vayu in the space outside is that which is called “shastravihita karma” [act according to the directives of scriptures]. The collective count, during the day and night, of this activity is 21,600 times. Those who disregard this activity that is injunction-perfected, and thereby take recourse in the forces of lust and such, and do whatever they want regarding the methods of the rites and abuse inhalation and exhalation – they do not get spiritual realization (the attainment of attainments), happiness (the Bliss of Brahman), or the Supreme Destiny (merging with Brahman) – none of that."
{24}{stop},"For that reason, “shastra” [scripture] is your “pramana” [standard; proof; guide] about that which is do be done and that which is not to be done. Here, knowing the actions that have been prescribed by the scriptures, engage in (sadhana).","In the commentary to the previous slokas [verses] [of this Chapter 16 of the Pranab Gita], the word “shastra” has been explained. In this sloka, it is being said that shastra is the guide/standard for determining that which is to be done and that which is not to be done. So, a little more detailed understanding of shastra [meaning: what shastra is] is necessary. By getting to know [what shastra is a little better], the sadhak will be able to take into his/her heart a deeper knowledge of this sloka [16:24].
 
In the previous commentary [to sloka 16:23 of the Pranab Gita] it was said that vayu [vital-air as a whole] rules the body; it is operating all of the functions of the body through the five pranas [particular vital-airs]. Thus, in the body, it is vayu that is “shastra.” In this [Bhagavad] Gita there is [the statement] “vAyuh sarvatrago mahAn” [vayu is primary in all] (Chapter 9, sloka 6). All of the functionalities of the senses, and even the activities of mind, intellect, ego and chitta [personal consciousness] are under the power of the operations of vayu. In this body, if one takes refuge in vayu and becomes a co-worker with it – meaning: upon doing Kriya using the power of vayu, with a devotedly tender heart – if one is able to make vayu equalized and subtle and bring it under one’s control, one can become the knower of all scriptures and be all-knowing. Adorned with all divine glories, one can attain Brahman-ness. In sutra [literary “thread”] 3 of the Prashnopanishad [a scripture] it is said: “prANAgnaya evaitasmin, pura jAgrati” – meaning: fire in the form of prana-vayu is indeed the living guru within the body. The Kriya of this vayu is called “Brahmavidya” [Brahman-knowledge]. This is because vayu itself is Brahman. In Taittireeya Upanishad [a scripture] it is said: “namaste vAyo tvameva pratyaksha brahmAsi tvameva pratyakshaṃ vadiShyAmi ṛtaṃ vadiShyAmi satyaṃ vadiShyAmi tanmAvatu” [I bow to you - vayu, you indeed are the perceivable Brahman; I proclaim that you indeed are the perceivable Brahman; I proclaim the Divine Order; I proclaim the Truth; may I be absorbed in that Truth].
 
Vayu has two qualities – sound and touch. The gurus say that if vayu moves through the subtle-nadi path, there is an experience of coolness in the seven layers of the skin. Feeling the pleasure of an inexpressible touching, bliss gathers in the mind, and many types of sound rise up within. All of those sounds gradually become transformed into “naad” [divine sound], and from naad, various types of waves of speech begin to flow. If one fixes one’s chitta [personal consciousness] in those waves of speech, shruti [Vedas and Upanishads], smriti [all other scriptures] and such [scriptures] – all matters of knowledge can be heard. All of these scriptures of knowledge actually arise via vayu, and because the world operates according to that knowledge, those shrutis [scriptures] and smritis [scriptures] are also called “shastra” [directives]. The compassionate sages and seers have written down that knowledge with the name of “shastra[s]” in many different forms of books. — Begin Footnote. — That is why it is set up like this: whichever discipline one does, one will be [or: is] practicing the shastra [scripture] related to that discipline. If that happens, one will come to know about the thing that one is practicing. “Yat yat shastraṃ samabhAset tat tat vrataṃ samAcharet” [translation of this Sanskrit statement is already provided in the first sentence of this footnote after the colon [:]]. — End Footnote. — Not only is [knowledge] heard [from naad], [but] from the center of that naad, a light shines forth. In that light, all of the happenings of past and future can be seen. Thus, vayu makes the sadhak all-knowing and all-seeing. And it also keeps the sadhak’s knowledge disciplined.

So there we have the description of what shastra is. How this shastra in the form of vayu is the standard/guide regarding the situations of what is to be done and what is not to be done – let us look at that. “Pramana” [proof; standard; guide] means that which brings certainty. Srimat Shankaracharya [a sage] said that the meaning of “pramana” means “knowledge,” [or] “sadhana” [endeavor to know]. Whether or not a particular thing is to be done or not to be done – in order to know that, in order to be sure about that – shastra is that which provides that certainty. This is because “shastra” – meaning: vayu, the ruler of the body, by becoming concentrated in the field of buddhi [intellect], activating the intellectual powers, and illuminating the buddhi, reveals that which is to be done and that which is not to be done. Those who have progressed a little bit in the path of sadhana – they know about this wondrous power of vayu. It can be seen that the kinds of states that ordinarily manifest within our inner beings during the waking state – when one sits in asana [meditation posture] and does Kriya, as vayu enters the subtle path even a little bit, all of those states no longer stay settled in our inner beings. It can even be experienced that the mind is agitated, nothing feels good, one does not want to stay in one place – if in this kind of state you turn around the movement of the body’s vayu, and, upon placing mind on vayu, drive vayu in the direction of Kutastha – then, with the turning around of vayu’s movement, the mind’s previous state [of agitation] becomes transformed. Vayu then goes on to move within the subtle path, and immediately, there is a wondrous change that happens to the mind. The mind perceives many things. All kinds of good and bad states from all kinds of times rise up in the mind. It is as if the mind rethinks about all of those states anew. Such is the intense force of the impressions left by previous experiences! After this, when vayu becomes equalized, it can be seen that the outer states no longer enter inside. The inner mind becomes drawn only to the happenings within. (Even extremely novice sadhaks feel and know this.) Not only that – when vayu becomes subtle, it becomes possible to direct vayu to wherever one wishes; one can make it concentrated as well. At that time, it can be seen that in particular places of the inner being, vayu brings about particular states. Even this: if the mind intensely desires to know something, vayu becomes one with that desire and becomes filled with consciousness, and after making the mind settled, steady and locked in a place of attention, [it is suddenly experienced that] someone just said something – this kind of non-embodied/untraceable voice tells the mind about the matter to be known. The uttering of that divine declaration, and the mind hearing that declaration – it works like lightning, startling the practitioner. And right upon hearing that, the mind becomes completely satisfied. There is nothing that remains to be understood, nor some little doubt here and there – none of that is there. The mind becomes totally, doubtlessly, fully certain about that matter. Such is the power of that [untraceable] utterance. Thus, in order to ascertain the situations of that which is to be done or not done, or that which is dutiful or not dutiful – dear sadhak, take recourse in the shastra in the form of vayu. It is shastra that will give you the guidance. It will prove to you with certainty what is dutiful and what is not dutiful. — Begin Footnote. — Just as without being knowledgeable in the scriptures, it is not possible to open up a scripture and prove a certain matter or analyze it, and then, [just as] one has to learn the proof in the scripture from someone who is knowledgeable in the scriptures – in the same way, for as long as the sadhak is not knowledgeable in the scriptures – meaning: [for as long as the sadhak] is not able to be adept at knowing scripture in the form of vayu – for that long the spoken word of guru is the guide regarding the situations of that which is to be done and that which is not to be done. The words from guru’s mouth and that non-embodied utterance within are one and not two different things. That non-embodied declaration is also guru’s teaching. This is because it is the operation of vayu. Vayu is itself guru. Because fire is the guru of the spiritually initiated, it is described in the Upanishads that the totality of prana is fire – [unclear print for the Sanskrit reference]. The world is itself prana-filled – “prANo hi bhagavAneeshah prANo viShNuh pitAmahah; prAneNa dhAryate lokah sarvaṃ prANamyaṃ jagat” [prana is indeed the Divine Lord, prana is Vishnu grandfather; prana is the support of the worlds [or: of people], all creation is filled with prana]. — End Footnote. — Scripture in the form of vayu will clearly show you the Brahman-Substance and give you the knowledge of the universe.

There is another way to know that shastra/scripture is the standard or the provider of certainty regarding that which is to be done and that which is not to be done. The activities of sattva, rajas, tamas – these three gunas [primal qualities], and earth, water, fire, air, ether – these five elements are not the same at all times in the body. At particular times, a particular guna and a particular element are more strongly active [than others]. The activities of each guna and each element bring forth different kinds of results. At the time of doing some work, upon knowing the possible results and non-results of that work, in order to ascertain if that work is to be done or not to be done – if one sees which guna and which element are operating [more strongly] in the body at that time, one can know. Every guna and every element has different colors. By seeing that, which guna and which element are more active at that time can be known. Sattva, rajas and tamas – these three gunas appear as three bindus [bindu = visible point/single dot/single spot] inside a triangular form [seen within]. The rajo-bindu is seen in the left corner of that triangle. Its name is “vama,” and its color is red (like blood). The sattva-bindu is seen in the top corner. Its name is “jyeshtha” and its color is white (like moonlight). The tamas-bindu is seen in the right corner and its name is “raudri,” and its color is black (like kohl). The color of earth is yellow; the color of water is pale green; the color of fire is red (like burning charcoal); the color of air is jungle-green (the color of smoke can also be seen in the air-element), and the color of ether is “asmani” [sky-blue/sky-color] (like in the sky). Vayu itself reveals all of these colors in Kutastha. If vayu is pulled up according to the guru-instructed method and attention is placed in Kutastha, the guna that is strong in the body [at that time] – its bindu, and the element that is operating [more strongly at that time] – its color, can be seen. It is by seeing these that yogis know the result and non-result of actions, and determine what is to be done and not done. If the color of earth [yellow] is seen, then it should be understood that the result will be quick, beneficent, safe etc. If the color of water [pale green] is seen, then it should be understood that getting a result is doubtful. If the color of fire [red, like burning charcoal] is seen, then it should be understood that there will not be any result. If the color of air [jungle-green, or the color of smoke] is seen, then it should be understood that the result may be good, but even if that happens, it will not be long-lasting. If the color of ether [sky-blue; sky-color] is seen, then it should be understood that there will be fruit, but slowly [or: after a long time]. The three bindus of the three gunas that can be seen in the triangular form [within] – among them, the guna that is more strong [at a particular time] – the bindu of that guna becomes clear; it becomes bright. When you see the light of rajoguna, then action will take place; dharma [righteousness; religion] will be attained, because “vama” is the dharma-bestowing shakti [power]. When you see the light of sattva guna, then do only the work of earning/money. The fruit of that will be obtained, because “jyeshtha” is the wealth-bestowing shakti. And when the light of tamoguna is seen, then if there is the endeavor to do the action of sexual desire, the desired fruits will be obtained, because “raudri” is the shakti that bestows the fulfillment of sexual desires. When these three bindus meet and become one, the Sri-Bindu is seen in the middle of that triangle. She is the Liberation-bestowing shakti.

As the sadhak goes on to rise to higher and higher fields in sadhana, along with that, the thorns on the path of his/her advancement (the functional forces of enmity) are seen. If an opposing active force is not destroyed immediately upon seeing it, one cannot rise any farther; the advancement is blocked. At that time, the rightful place to which the sadhak has reached – he/she has to know the particular action/rite that has to be performed according to the nature of that place, and then has to perform that act and destroy that enemy. The Lord is giving attention to the appropriate karma [act] that has to performed in the rightful place when, in Chapter 18 [of the Bhagavad Gita], He says, “sahajaṃ karma kaunteya sadoShatamapi na tyajet.” The meaning of this will be explained in the appropriate place.
 
“DevAn bhAvayatAnena” [the demi-gods, having been pleased] etc. – this ancient scriptural directive – when obstacles appear to impede the carrying out of these directives – in order to remove those obstacles, there are several procedures. Knowing those procedures at the appropriate times, one has to perform karma [acts] according to that. Gurudev is the one who teaches that to the sadhak. Upon becoming engrossed [in spiritual practice], and practicing Kriya with the usual method, as the sadhak gains the right to enter within, he/she comes to know from gurudev, one after another: the second Kriya, the third Kriya, the fourth Kriya and such other different Kriyas, along with certain practices to specifically make things more facilitating in sadhana – such as ida-pingala-shodhan-Kriya, granthi-bheda-Kriya and many such different Kriyas – and practices all of them. With that, the obstacles are destroyed, and along with spiritual advancement, many types of glorious attainments go on being actualized. There is a certain special way as far as the method of performing those Kriyas. This is because in all of those Kriyas, an effort has to be made on the breath according to guru’s instructions. The breath has to be gradually made long. The vayu has to be pulled up and put down steadily but with great intensity. The time of stillness between exhalation and inhalation has to be increased. The breath has to be drawn up and then put down sometimes from the throat or sometimes from the palate. When one becomes accomplished with these Kriyas, as the paths of all of the nadis become clear/clean, the path of sadhana becomes free of thorns [obstacles], and the possibility of the pain of death at the time of death, which can make one unsteady and lose oneself, is also taken away.
 
Now let us see at which kind of rightful place the sadhak Arjuna, as described in the [Bhagavad] Gita, is situated at present. He is the crest-jewel of sadhana of the kshatriyas [warriors]. Now, he is sitting on a chariot, ready for battle in front of enemies in Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra. He had raised his bow at the time that the weapons would begin to be used. [And then this happened:] “aham mameti” [they [the enemies] are mine] – he become overcome by the delusion of samsara. And being filled with grief, he threw down the weapons, abandoned his power of kingship, fell into the drawing power of tamoguna (of Prakritic tamas), and became completely confused as to what to do. That is why the Lord, in the form of sattva guna, is dispelling Arjuna’s delusion with the light of Self-Knowledge. He is saying “iha shAstravidhAnoktaṃ karma jnAtvA kartuṃ arhasi” [you should know the scripturally advised act and should do it]; “sahajaṃ karma kaunteya sadoShamapi na tyajet” [do not abandon the natural act [that should be done], O Kaunteya [Arjuna] even if it is imperfectly done]. This means: you are a kshatriya [of the warrior caste]; in you, rajoguna is primary but mixed with sattva guna. You are ready to do battle in the field of war, the playground of kshatriyas. This rightful place in which you are established – in this [place,] your natural karma [set of actions] is valor, power, fortitude, adeptness, not running from battle, generosity and godliness. These are the prescribed karma [ways of doing and being] as said in the scriptures. There is no one better than you who can do this karma. If you abandon this natural activity of yours, and take refuge in tamoguna and become deluded, then – “adhogacchhanti tAmasAh” [the tamasic go in the downward direction] – following this statement, you will fall to the lower levels [of existence]. Therefore, take up valor, power, fortitude etc., and practice the prana-moving Kriya according to the proper procedure[s]. Destroy the lowly forces of latent desires that oppose the subtle-prana [alternate translation: destroy the opposing, lowly forces of latent desires in the form of subtle energies]. "
