### Bengali Translation

Brahman-Nirvana prevails in both the states of life and death for the sannyasis who are with disciplined chitta that is free of desire and anger, and who see Oneness in all.

### Commentary 
 --- 
The sannyasi who is endowed with the [previously mentioned] qualities – that  sannyasi is “jivanmukta” [Liberated while living in the body]. Liberated in this life – meaning: because of abiding in Brahman, that being has no erroneous contact, and Free in death as well – meaning: immediately upon death, that sadhak attains the destination of no return, or the Supreme Destination. Those qualities such as freedom from desire and anger etc. cannot be attained at all without karmayoga [yogic practice]. In order to make that clear, the Lord has elucidated all of those particular characteristics of sannyasis. For this reason, He is speaking in an expanded way about karmayoga in the next sloka. “Viditatma” [knowing the Self] – meaning: merging with the Self – like the union of the flame with the Flame.
