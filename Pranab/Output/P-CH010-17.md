### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Yogi [Sri Krishna]! In what way can I contemplate You at all times and get to know You? O Lord! In which “bhaav[s]” (things) will You appear in my contemplation?

### Commentary 
 --- 
In what way can I contemplate You at all times and get to know Your Yogic State? It is seen in sadhana: as long as there is chitta-dharma [dharma of personal consciousness], that yogi-state never comes. The word “bhaav” [state] itself refers to that yogi-state. But O Lord! How and to which “bhaav” will I merge my contemplation? Contemplation cannot reach “bhaav” [spiritual state] at all and in any way. So then in which states will You be the matter of contemplation?
