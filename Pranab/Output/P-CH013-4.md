### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
That field – which is seen – which is changeable – the thing from which it [that field] emerges and its [the source’s] form – and how that One is, and what the powers are of that One – hear about that, in brief, from Me.

### Commentary 
 --- 
The field that was spoken about just previously – how that field – in the form of the body – is, how it is endowed with the natures of physical visibility and such, how it is endowed with the ways of desire and such, how it is enjoined with the sense-organs and such, how it arises from the union of Prakriti and Purush, and how the different manifestations are – from a stone to living beings and such – and, as well, the Knower of that field, that True Substance, through Whose Glory that untrue field is colored with manifestations of Truth – what That One is and what That One’s Powers are – I am now telling you about that in a condensed way. Listen.
