### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
This whole creation, entranced by the experiential states of the three gunas, cannot know Me, the Highest of all and Inexhaustible.

### Commentary 
 --- 
All lives in the creation are captivated by the three experiential states of sattva, rajas and tamas – the states of the three gunas – meaning: being taken over by the illusory powers of the three gunas, the living beings believe that the activities of the gunas are eternal, pure and highest; and not having the power of discrimination, they drown [in samsara] because of that very perception. Thus, as their inner senses are covered by the covering of the gunas, they cannot become all-seeing. For this reason, they cannot know that “I” which is beyond the three gunas, which is Highest of the high and Inexhaustible, and which is the Foundation of the tri-guna-filled creation.
