तस्माद्यस्य महाबाहो निगृहीतानि सर्वश: |
इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता || 68||
tasmād yasya mahā-bāho nigṛihītāni sarvaśhaḥ
indriyāṇīndriyārthebhyas tasya prajñā pratiṣhṭhitā

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O mighty-armed one [Arjuna]! Indeed, it is for this reason that it has been said: “the one whose sense-organs have, in all ways, left the abode of the worldly things – that is the one whose prajna is established.

### Commentary 
 --- 
That is why one has to take all of the sense-organs from the worldly things, extinguish them and have complete self-control. Without “samyama” [see sloka 69 below] – meaning: without being “yukta” [enjoined to the Self; see commentary on sloka 66 of this Chapter 2], no sadhana happens at all. The self-controlled one is called “sthitaprajna.”
