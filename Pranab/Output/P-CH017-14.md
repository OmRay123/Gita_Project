### Commentary 
 --- 
When there is the slipping off of the path of Brahman, and thus there is the absorbed and merged worship of gods, the form of guru, and the forms of sages – that is when there is the worship of gods, guru and the wise. And when I am intoxicated by My Own Form and merged with It, that is when there is the worship of the twice-born. At that time, there is no vanity/awareness of the physical body. But because one is engrossed in the Form of the Self, this [state] is called “dvija” [twice-born]. The one for whom two births happen in one lifetime – that is the one who is “dvija.” It is like the caterpillar and the butterfly from the caterpillar. In this state, the mind sits there with just one object. That settledness is called “shaucha” [cleanliness/purity]. Simplicity is transparency manifested; that is “arjava” [virtue]. Because the reproductive seed is calm, it is called “brahmacharya” [continence]. The mind does not have aggression towards others – that is “ahimsa” [non-aggression]. Because all aspects of the sadhak’s bodily operations are functioning excellently in this state, this state is called “sharirik tapa” [bodily austerities].
