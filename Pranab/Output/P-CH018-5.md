यज्ञदानतप:कर्म न त्याज्यं कार्यमेव तत् |
यज्ञो दानं तपश्चैव पावनानि मनीषिणाम् || 5||
yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat
yajño dānaṁ tapaśh chaiva pāvanāni manīṣhiṇām

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
yajna, charity, austerities, karma [rites] are not things to be renounced. They are obligatory actions. Yajna, charity, and austerities are verily the things that purify the chitta[s] [personal consciousness[es]] of the “manishees” [sages]. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
If one remains with mind, then one cannot stay without yajna, austerities, charity – all these [types of] actions. The samskaras [latent tendencies] make one do these [acts] automatically/spontaneously. As such, the ingredients (masala [spices]) needed to purify the antahkarana [operators of personal consciousness] of the discerning ones are yajna, charity and austerities.
