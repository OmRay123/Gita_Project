### Bengali Translation

O Infinite One! You are the Primal God and the Ancient Person. You are the place where this creation ends. (You verily are) the Knower, the Known and the Supreme Abode (State of Vishnu). All of creation is pervaded by You. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
Previously, the sadhak saw the Universal Form in the “place.” Now, the sadhak is seeing the “place” in the Universal Form. “TvamAdideva” [You are the Primal God] – O Lord! I see that You are Prior to even that which is first. Laying down in this city of Maya, You have taken on the name of “Purush” [Person]. Everything has an end. Only You are the Endless Eternal. You are the final place, or abode, of rest [resolution] for these names and forms. Whatever there is to be known – only You know all of that. And then again, whatever there is to be known is also You. O Infinite One! You are in this creation, and this creation is in You, like water and sugar in liquified sugar-water. That, verily, is “Param” [Supreme] (Brahman).
