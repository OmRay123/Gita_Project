### Prose 
 --- 
यदहङ्कारमाश्रित्य न योत्स्य इति मन्यसे |
मिथ्यैष व्यवसायस्ते प्रकृतिस्त्वां नियोक्ष्यति || 59||
yad ahankāram āśhritya na yotsya iti manyase
mithyaiṣha vyavasāyas te prakṛitis tvāṁ niyokṣhyati

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
This that you are thinking – “I will not do battle” – because of having taken recourse in egotism – this business (endeavor) of yours is absolutely false (worthless), because Prakriti will force you to (be engaged in) battle. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
If you take recourse in egotism and think that you will not do battle (Kriya) and sit about like that – that will not work for you. You are kshatriya. Your nature will not let you go without doing battle (Kriya). You yourself will not be able to remain [like this] without doing it [battle; Kriya].
