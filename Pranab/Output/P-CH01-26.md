### Commentary 
 --- 
Then that motherly-feeling-oriented sadhak went on to see all of the essential vrittis, both opposing and supportive. In the body of the human being, [one can find] through the help of sadhana that there are many such natural/simple nadis through which many types of vrittis rise forth with the aid of mind and intellect. And once one vritti rises, from that several new vrittis are created. In this way, the vrittis, mixed and unmixed, keep rising up in innumerable forms. The saintly sages, who were surrendered to God, were scientists of the body [physical, subtle and causal]; they spoke about [the subtle things] by re-representing the [inner] forms dressed up as characters of samsaric relationships. It is for this reason that words such as “father” and “grandfather” etc. are being used here.
