“I”, being “vaishvanara” [digestive fire] and entering the body [or: entering the middle of the body], join with prana and apana [certain vital airs] and digest the four types of food.

### Commentary 
 --- 
The Lord is presiding in the form of “vaishvanara” fire [digestive fire] in the belly of the living being. That fire, upon mixing with the self-stimulating prana and apana, digests these four types of edible foods: “charvya” – that which is consumed by chewing; “choshya” – that which is consumed by sucking; “lehya” – that which is consumed by licking; [and] “peya” – that which is drunk. That is why this “vaishvanara” fire is the support for all living beings. Through the management of heat/pressure in all of the body, he is preserving the life-force. When he is disturbed, the body is also disturbed, and it is when he leaves that the body dies. Every day, yogis do “agnihotra” [oblations in the fire] with this sadhana [practice] – “pranApanau samau kṛtvA” [keeping prana and apana equal] – to appease this “vaishvanara.”
