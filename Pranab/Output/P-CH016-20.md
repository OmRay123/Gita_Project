### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! (All of those) stupidly ignorant ones, because of attaining asuric wombs birth after birth, and not attaining Me, get destinies that are even lower.

### Commentary 
 --- 
O Kaunteya [Arjuna; the sadhak]! Because of not attaining “I”, those stupidly ignorant ones of asuric wombs go very far away from “I”, and, with the Light of “I” out of sight, go on again and again taking lower births of deeply tamasic [dark] nature, and thereafter become idiotic insects in hell. And they do not then have the ability to attain “I”.
