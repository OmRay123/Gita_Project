### Prose 
 --- 
यं यं वापि स्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेवरम् |
तं तमेवैति कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावित: || 6||
yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajatyante kalevaram
taṁ tam evaiti kaunteya sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Kaunteya [son of Kunti; Arjuna]! Through constant practice, the one in whose mind this state of being becomes strong – that person leaves the body at the time of death while continuously remembering that state. Therefore, that being attains a body filled with that state. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
Life is coming to an end; death is coming. This time of transition – whichever of the manovrittis [functionalities of mentation] that one takes up at this time – when taking the last breath and leaving the body – that being will attain a state according to that particular vritti [experiential functionality]. For this reason, when finishing every single breath, one must inwardly pay attention to that Supreme State of the Lord and release every single breath in that way. This is because I don’t really know if this is my last breath or not. “The sadhak must be careful with every one of the 21,600 breaths every single time.”
