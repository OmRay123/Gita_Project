### Commentary 
 --- 
When Gudakesh Parantapa Arjuna (the sadhak) goes on speaking in the previously seen ways [in the previous slokas], at that time, he has a direct encounter with Kutastha Chaitanya in the form of Hrishikesh – meaning: [the sadhak] sees that it is actually Kutastha Chaitanya that is presiding as the ruler over all of the senses. After that, whatever the sadhak becomes intent on, [like] “I won't fight the war [do Kriya] any more (whatever happens, let it happen), right then the form of “Govinda” appears. (“Go” = the whole of the universe; this body of the five elements; “vid” = knowing; the One Who is the Knower of the universe, the Witness, the Foundation – it is He Who is “Govinda.”). This means: Seeing Kutastha-Brahman as the Total Witness and the Foundation of this entire formed-universe, the sadhak directly realizes: “all is He.” When this happens, the non-involved feeling blossoms forth. At that time, the sadhak becomes totally silent. The state devoid of any activity [or: this state of complete silence] is called “tushnibhava.” In this state, all of the senses take a respite from their individual activities, and mind, having given up trying and not taking up anything as a support, remains just as it is within itself. It is not possible to avoid calling this “tushnibhava” by the names of “Gudakesh” and “Parantapa.” The one who has overcome sleep (laziness), the one who has learned to “put sleep to sleep,” the one who – because of having brought sleep completely under his power – [who,] even at the habitual time of sleeping, does not fall into the dream-delusion of the mire of Maya – meaning: the one who - during in the “waking dream” - always remains in the Consciousness of the Self – that one is “Gudakesh.” And the one who has become an “asana-siddha” [one who has perfected/conquered the seated posture] – meaning: the kinds of troubles that used to come up because of the [physical and subtle] tendons and pathways being blocked by the gross [humors] vayu-pitta-kapha [air-bile-phlegm], like: needing to massage the knees, the back and such being tense and agitated – the one who, through determined and steady practice, has destroyed all of those [afflictions] and is able to effortlessly sit in a still-posture for a long time, for whom no desperation/comes, instead he/she feels the great comfort that comes from lying down when he/she sits in asana – in short, the one who cannot be deterred from his own endeavor by any of the soldiers of Prakriti – that is the one who is “Parantapa.”
