### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Even a person of “sudurachar” [wrongful character; see commentary below for deeper explanation] – if that person meditates upon Me single-mindedly – then that kind of person should be thought of as a sage. This is because that person is completely engaged, with resolve, in Spirit.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Dear sadhak! Look into Kriya and see and understand that if I go about (there is no “going about” except for in the worldly experience) with attachment in my heart, then the worldly experience stays very far from “I”. And having attachment for the worldly experience and remaining intoxicated in its enjoyments and partaking in it for lifetimes – that is the state of “sudurachar” [staying far away from “I”]. This is because it is full of restlessness. Yet, as soon as I leave behind the attachment for the worldly experience, aim for My True Form in Kutastha, become engaged in the subtle breath and become settled in “dharana” [natural state of concentration], right then, I become “I”. I become a sage. This is verily that which called “atmanishtha” [dedicated/devoted to the Self].
