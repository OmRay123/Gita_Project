व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिरेकेह कुरुनन्दन |
बहुशाखा ह्यनन्ताश्च बुद्धयोऽव्यवसायिनाम् || 41||
vyavasāyātmikā buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana
bahu-śhākhā hyanantāśh cha buddhayo ’vyavasāyinām

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Kurunandan [Arjuna]! In this karmayoga, the intellect becomes “vyavasayatmika” (full of conviction), and “eka” [one and only/singular]. But the intellects of the “avyavasayis” [ones with wrong conviction] become multi-branched and endless [endlessly bound].

### Commentary 
 --- 
In this karmayoga, the intellect becomes “vyavasatmika” (“vy” = space eye + “av” = spreading + “so” = death) – meaning: upon being spread out in the space filled [inner] eye, and thereby becoming Still, one becomes filled with Stillness and Absolute Certainty; and [the intellect] becomes “eka” [one and only/singular] – meaning: being firmly established in the Star in the center of Kutastha – with Light like millions of suns and the beautiful tranquility of millions of moons, one becomes the Bliss of the One, or filled with the Bliss of Brahman. But those who are “avyavasayi” (“a” = prefix of negation + “vy” = particular + “ava” = certainty + “so” = “udyoga” [endeavoring]) – meaning: those who, through particular convictions - “udyoga” (“ut” = in the path of Brahman; “yoga” = those who do not do the practice of the Kriya of pranayam etc. [the total meaning of “udyoga” in only this particular context is given here]) - their buddhi-vrittis (intellect) leave the oneness and fall to “many-ness,” becoming multi-branched – meaning: coming into contact with many different types of worldly things, [the intellect] takes on many different forms. And it is endless – meaning: being locked-up in the partaking of worldly things, the [variations of the intellect] continue to grow endlessly because of the tumult of the repeated births and deaths. One is not able to leave the worldly consciousness, not able to come to Brahman and cannot attain the Radiant Fountain of Bliss. One does not get the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana [Emancipation].
