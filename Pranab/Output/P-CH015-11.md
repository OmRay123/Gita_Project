### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The endeavoring yogis are the ones who can see the residing Self in the body. But a person of impure heart and persons of wrongful ways cannot see It (the Self) even if they endeavor.

### Commentary 
 --- 
This casting off of the body, the taking up of a body, the staying and the enjoying of the worldly experience –  through their endeavor (sadhana) yogis see this while abiding in the Self by themselves. But the dogmatic non-discriminating ones (those who do not do [spiritual practice]) – even if they tear their hairs out from the head and die – cannot see [this]. This means: those whose personal consciousness has not been purified, and thus the perspective is also not settled – even if they take all the care to make effort according to the scriptural texts and such – because their inner sight has not opened, they cannot see anything of the subtler than the subtlest Self.
