### Commentary 
 --- 
Dear sadhak! That flow of light is coming from you (see 4th sloka [unclear reference]) and revealing this world. As universe-pervading as you are – look, look – that great light of yours is similarly universe-pervading. Earth, tree, stones – because their opaqueness makes them unable to shine forth your light, your light has not left either their outer or inner places. As you are Vishnu, your light too is pervading the universe-sheath. Because of the transparentness of the moon, sun and fire, your light is shining forth on their bodies. That is why, in order to destroy the delusion of the jiva, you are saying, “That light of the sun – (“AdityanAmahaṃ viShNu” [I am Vishnu among the “adityas” [suns; of solar dynasty]]) – that which is illuminating the whole world – that light of the moon and fire – know that that brilliance is My brilliance.” Lord! Lord! How Complete!
