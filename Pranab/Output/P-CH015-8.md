śharīraṁ yad avāpnoti yach chāpy utkrāmatīśhvaraḥ
gṛihītvaitāni sanyāti vāyur gandhān ivāśhayāt

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
When “Ishvara” ([as] jiva [the person], the lord of the body) takes on the body and leaves the body – at that time, like taking along the perfume blown by the wind from flowers and such, he takes the senses, with the mind as the sixth, with him.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Where the flower is, I do not know. But just as the wind takes the flower’s scent, brings it, fills the nose and enchants – in the same way, when one body dies, “Ishvara,” the presiding ruler of the body and senses and such – or the jiva [individual soul] – carries, along with the mass of karma [actions and their fruits] that has been done by that body, those three gunas, the senses and the mind, and enters [or: takes on] another body.
