### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The particular causes that make the restless and unsettled mind move away [from spiritual attention] – bring the mind away from those particular causes and keep it under the control of the Self.

### Commentary 
 --- 
As the memories and tendencies awaken some worldly experience like sound and such, whatever it is that breaks the mind off from the Self, at that very moment that particular thing can be known. At that time, through the attitude of detachment, seeing the true nature of those particular worldly experiences (their insubstantial nature), one has to take the mind from those things, return it to the Self, and keep the mind under control. Doing this repeatedly in this way, the memories and tendencies become powerless. The mind itself will leave its restless nature and take up settledness.
