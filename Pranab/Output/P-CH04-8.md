For the sake of the protection of the “sadhus” [sages; or: the good], the destruction of the “dushkrit” [evil doers], and to establish dharma, I incarnate from epoch to epoch.

### Commentary 
 --- 
“Sadhu”: “sa” = the subtle breath + “a” = “aasakti” [addiction/attachment] + “dha” = “dhriti” [holding; patience] + “u” = settledness – those who become attached to the subtle breath, and thereby, with forbearance, attain settledness – meaning: those who patiently hold on to the path of nivritti – it is they who are “sadhus.” All of the vrittis [functionalities] that are necessary in order to be a sadhu – all of those [vrittis] are [also] “sadhu” [saintly]. And the vrittis that are maleficent, they are all “dushkrit” [evil-doers] (“du” + “krit” = “asat” [maleficent] vritti[s]). The sadhana-supporting vrittis such as discrimination, detachment, serenity, self-control, forbearance and such are “sadhu[s]” [saints]. And lust, greed, delusion, egotism, jealousy, disdain and such sadhana-opposing vrittis are “dushkrit” [evil-doers]. The various types of forms in which the Beloved Deity appears, as described in the commentary to the previous sloka [4:7] – when He appears again and again in those different forms, all of those vrittis of goodness become stronger; they do not get corrupted or ruined in any way by the pull of samsara. And all of those evil-doing or maleficent vrittis get destroyed; they can no longer rise up in the mind and can no longer make one be entranced by the worldly experience. When the vrittis of goodness thusly have their deliverance, and the maleficent vrittis are destroyed, there is “dharma-samshthapan” [the settledness of dharma]! “Samsthapan”: sam = to make equal [or: equilibrium] + doing “sthapa” [settle] + “an” [a suffix of grammatical declension] – to settle in the state of equilibrium is “samsthapan.” “Dharma”: the aggregate of the vrittis of the twenty-four substances, or activity – which are, by nature, endowed with agitation. When this dharma, by being gathered up in Layayoga [the yoga of merging], gets locked in the Awareness-Consciousness, it becomes still and merges in equilibrium [in Awareness-Consciousness]. That is what is known as the “samsthapan of dharma” [the settling of dharma]. This means: not allowing dharma to do any work at all and making it sit silently is that which is called “dharma-samsthapan.” Through the grace of guru, along with elevation in the progress of sadhana, upon cutting through the coverings [of illusion], when the Revelations of the Light of Satchitananda happen in Kutastha – in those times, the sadhak becomes intoxicated with Bliss. Taking to heart the sadhak's impermanence and Brahman's Eternity, the sadhak, now filled with detachment [to the world] and such, goes forward in sadhana with greater and greater intensity. The sadhak does not become afraid or withdrawn because of the difficulties of sadhana. Therefore, the sadhak does not again have to succumb to the delusion of samsara. The sadhak receives deliverance.
