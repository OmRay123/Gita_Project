### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
They [the asuras] say that the world is without truth, without basis, without God, and exists without [divine] causation. There is no other cause for it [the world] but lust.

### Commentary 
 --- 
The way that things are going and happening – I see that this world is really like this. There is no righteousness or unrighteousness. There is nothing called truth or God either. The world rises only because of the intercourse between male and female. The purpose of this world is to take care of the body and enjoy. This is the perspective in the minds of the asuras.
