### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Incomparable Glory! You are the Father of this world of the moving and non-moving, the venerable Guru and the Guru of gurus. There is no one comparable to You in the three worlds. Where is there anyone greater than You?

### Commentary 
 --- 
You are the Father of the worlds in creation, from inert matter to living beings. This is because all of this is arising from You alone. Not only that – to this creation, You are the Worshiped One, and You are the Guru even of the gurus. In all of this, there is no one at all who is beyond You. There is no way to fathom Your Radiance (Power) in these three worlds. Your Power is beyond the powers of the twenty-four Prakritic substances. That is why You are the Incomparable Power. You are One and without a second.
