### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Speech that does not cause tension, and [speech] that is true, agreeable and beneficial, and the practice of the recitation of the Vedas – these are called “austerities of speech.”

### Commentary 
 --- 
When true words – words that are kind and beneficial for people – and speech that causes no tension for anyone – when this type of speech comes forth from the mouth automatically – that is when there is the state of “disciplined speech.” When the idea “I am the body” disappears and I merge, pervade and abide in the Self of all selves and phenomena (the all-pervading Consciousness/Spirit), that is when the word “svadhyaya” [self-study] finds its true meaning [Knowledge of the Self]. “Sva” = the sound means “svarga” [heaven], plane, or another name for “Ishvara” [God], and the word “adhyaya” means the expansion of the attainment (the paravastha of Kriya). When, at the time of Kriya, speech about these does come out, not much has to be said. Just a little does the work. And if one stays in the pervading state, there is no chance of speaking. Therefore, one becomes “disciplined with speech.” That is why this kind of state is called “austerity of speech.”
