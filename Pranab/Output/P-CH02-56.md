### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
One whose mind is not distressed in pain/suffering, one who is indifferent in pleasure, one who is devoid of attachment, fear and anger and is a muni [sage] – it is that person who is called “sthitaprajna.”

### Commentary 
 --- 
Samsara – [meaning:] that which is called “pleasure and pain” - that does not remain in that person. This is because: while being in the matters of pleasure and pain in the world, that person does not live in the worldliness; therefore, attachment, fear and anger find no place in him/her. Because of that sadhak's mind being “sangleena” [enjoined to the Self] to the universe-pervading Supreme Self – that sadhak is called “muni” [peaceful sage]. The separated state of mind is jiva. The “sangleena” state [of the mind] is “Ishvara” [God as a separate identity]. And the “praleena” [dissolved in the Self] state is Shiva or Brahman. The “sthitadhi” [spiritually steady] person is in the “Ishvara” condition.
