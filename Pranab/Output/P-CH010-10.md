### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Those who are ever-united in yoga, and worship Me with love, I bestow upon them that “buddhi-yoga” (jnana [spiritual knowledge]), by which, they attain Me.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Those who enjoy that happiness of the Bliss of Brahman at all times – because of being under the Power of Love, they do not want to ever let go of “I”; they worship [“I”]. Thus, I take their minds and merge them into “I” and make them “I”, and thus, they become “I”.
