### Prose 
 --- 
यातयामं गतरसं पूति पर्युषितं च यत् |
उच्छिष्टमपि चामेध्यं भोजनं तामसप्रियम् || 10||
yāta-yāmaṁ gata-rasaṁ pūti paryuṣhitaṁ cha yat
uchchhiṣhṭam api chāmedhyaṁ bhojanaṁ tāmasa-priyam

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
[Foods] that are “yatayama” (food cooked the day before), tasteless, old/rotten, even previously chewed and foul (inedible) – these types of foods are indeed favored by the tamasic ones.

### Commentary 
 --- 
“Yatayama” = cooked food older than one day. “Gataras” [dried-up] = hard rice, dried up/stale bread and such. “Pooti” = rotten, malodorous food – pickles and such. “Paryushita” = food cooked in the previous day (old food). “Ucchhishta” [previously chewed] = already eaten (food eaten partially by others). “Amedhya” [foul] = impure, bad food. These are favored by those who are tamoguna predominant. Know that whichever guna is predominant in the body, so is the preference of diet.
