### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Continuously going on practicing in this way, when the mind becomes totally free from all of the [experiences] of rajoguna and impure states, and thereby attains the state of profound peace – it is then that this yogi, endowed with the State of Brahman, attains Supreme Happiness.

### Commentary 
 --- 
In the previously mentioned ways, bringing the mind under the control of the Self via pratyahar [turning inward] again and again, the yogi becomes filled with profound peace – meaning: his/her mind leaves restlessness and becomes settled. Later, even the activities of the yogi's rajoguna also come to peace. And because of that happening, because the afflictions such as delusion become extremely weak, the yogi now has peaceful rajas [guna]. After that, the yogi becomes “brahmabhoot” [of Brahman-Substance] – meaning: becomes “jivanmukta” [Liberated while alive in the body]. Then the yogi no longer has the error of perceiving differences. Therefore, the Supreme Happiness that is the Bliss of Brahman, that which cannot be spoken about, which is incomparable, that which is only experienced through Higher Awareness – Eternal – beyond the senses – that Very Great Happiness manifests in the yogi spontaneously, automatically.
