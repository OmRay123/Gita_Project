कच्चिन्नोभयविभ्रष्टश्छिन्नाभ्रमिव नश्यति |
अप्रतिष्ठो महाबाहो विमूढो ब्रह्मण: पथि || 38||
kachchin nobhaya-vibhraṣhṭaśh chhinnābhram iva naśhyati
apratiṣhṭho mahā-bāho vimūḍho brahmaṇaḥ pathi

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Mahabaho [Mighty-armed One; Sri Krishna]! Will those [unperfected yogis], because they were incapable of becoming established in the Path of Brahman, and thereby fell to ignorance – will they, because of having fallen from both yoga and karma [rites; or: spiritual acts], be destroyed like the breaking of clouds, or what? 

### Commentary 
 --- 
After clouds spread, some become broken apart by destructive airs, cannot stay still in one place, and not being still, are not able to get the helpful airs either; thus they do not melt. Because they do not get either of the states of being clouds or water, they disappear into the sky through the forces of air. In the same way, those who are not disciplined, or having fallen into psychic wrongness [at the time of death], are not able to stay in the Path of Brahman – meaning: cannot establish themselves in the Sky of Brahman or the Sky of Consciousness, and therefore fall to ignorance, and cannot differentiate between the Divine [from the psychic wrongness] – because yoga (gyana) and karma (practice) are both destroyed for them, will they receive the base destiny of the ordinary and ignorant ones who are mixed-up in samsara?
