### Commentary 
 --- 
O sadhak who is addicted to the worldly experience! If you can, with full certainty and without doubt, take refuge in that Upper “I”, then your state of being a woman (meaning: when the lust for enjoying the eight essences of desire increases in your antahkarana [inner being] – that state), your state of being a “vaishya” [commerce caste; third caste of the four-caste system] (meaning: the supernatural manifestations that are attained through Kriya after practicing Kriya – to show that off – to look great in the eyes of people – that), and your state of being a “shudra” [see Bengali translation above] (“sha” = “shvaas” [breath] + “u” = settledness + “d” = yoni + “raṃ” = manifestation – meaning: the state in which every exhalation and inhalation remains active in the yoni – meaning: when the antahkarana [inner being] becomes blinded by lust/desire and becomes a servant of enjoying desires – that) – all three of these wither and become My Supreme Destination – they become that “I”.
