### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Those who have become free of “maan” [ordinary meaning: repute; see commentary below for inner meaning] and delusion, those who have overcome the errors of attachment to the forms of sons and such, those who are engaged in the discussion of the Supreme Self, those whose desires have fully been withdrawn, those who have become free of the conflicts named pleasure and pain – they become “amudha” [non-ignorant] (meaning: free of ignorance) and attain that Non-diminishing State.

### Commentary 
 --- 
“Kriyayorantaraṃ yuktavishrAmo mAnamuchyate” [the resting time between two accomplishments is called “maana” [contentment in the accomplishment]]– one thing is accomplished; there is the hope of another – the resting that happens between these two is that which is called “maan.” And the repose that is there at the end of all of the operations of the cosmos-creation – that is that which is called “nirmaan” [beyond “maan”].
 
The absorption in ignorance that is there because of placing “I-ness” in anything other than “I” - that is called “moha” [delusion]. “Mama mAtA, mama pitA, mameyaṃ gṛhiNe gṛhaṃ etadanyAṃ mamatvaṃ yat sa moha iti keertitah” [my mother, my father, my spouse and my house too – this “my-ness” towards others results in “moha” [delusion]]. And abiding in the True “I” is called “nirmoha” [beyond delusion; non-delusion].
 
The desire to associate/unite with something/someone other than “I” is called “sangadosha” [error of association]. The settled state that is there after totally erasing this desire from the inner being is that which is called “jitasangadosha” [victorious over the error of association].
 
When the mind leaves everything and remains absorbed in only the Self – that state is called “adhyatmanitya” [always in the knowledge of Spirit].
 
The lust to get something other than “I” is called “kama.” And the Settledness in Brahman that is there after all desires of “having” are extinguished – that is verily the state of “vinivrittakama” [fully departed from lust].
 
Two things opposing each other is called “dvandva” [conflict], like: cold and heat, pleasure and pain, attachment and repulsion etc. The full withdrawal from this is called the state of “dvanda vimukti” [being completely free of “dvandva”].
 
When all of these [negative] states are gone, one becomes “amudha” [non-ignorant]. And that “amudha” is the one who attains the Non-diminishing “That.”
