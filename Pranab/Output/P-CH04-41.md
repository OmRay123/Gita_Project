yoga-sannyasta-karmāṇaṁ jñāna-sañchhinna-sanśhayam
ātmavantaṁ na karmāṇi nibadhnanti dhanañjaya

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Dhananjaya [Arjuna]! The one who, through karmayoga [yogic practice] destroys all karmas in their totality, and through gyanayoga tears up all doubts/conflicts – the mass of karmas cannot bind that person endowed with the Knowledge of the Self.

### Commentary 
 --- 
(The Brahman-abidance that is attained through the two ways of karma [yogic act] and gyana-ness that Sri Bhagavan [Sri Krishna] has spoken about thus far – He is summing up those very things in this sloka as well as the following sloka.) If – upon taking up karmayoga of putting mind into prana and uniting prana and apana, and later, through gyanayoga of putting mind into mind, and thereby doing the sadhana of uniting the delusional “I” (that of the personal self) and the Pure “I” (that of the Supreme Self) – one destroys the states of doubt, and abides in the State of the Self – even if one comes into contact with the worldly experience because of having to carry out prarabdha karma, one does not have to be bound by the ties of karma. Like the leaves of the arum lilies or the leaves of the lotus, even if water is poured on them, the water leaves no marks on them.
