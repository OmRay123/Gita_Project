### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
(The particular knowledge of that field and that knower of the field) have been sung (spoken) by many sages in many ways. And it has also been sung by analytical practitioners seeking confirmation by citing aphorisms regarding Brahman.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Sages such as Vashishtha etc. have expounded, in many ways, about the field and the knower of the field. In the Vedas too, such as the Rig [Veda] etc., there are many different types of descriptions. And the reason and analysis oriented practitioners, who are free of doubts, have made statements and left works regarding Brahman (“athAto brahmajijnAsA” [henceforth, the enquiry regarding Brahman] and such Vedanta sutras and statements in the Upanishads). There are explanations in those [works] as well. All of those expositions are extensive and not easy to grasp fully. That is why the Lord begins to tell Arjuna about the field and the knower of the field in a summarized way.
