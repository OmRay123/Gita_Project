### Commentary 
 --- 
The [wish to] enjoy the worldly experience is called “kama” [desire; lust; craving] (hankering is also “kama”). Just by being a human being there are worldly experiences for enjoyment. However, those who progress a little in sadhana, their desires of those enjoyments become fulfilled (miracles). Putting mind into all of those things of enjoyment [mentioned in the previous sentence] – meaning: if one becomes “kamakami” [desirer of desires], one has to succumb to being bound; no further ascension happens. That person who has beaten away all of the things of enjoyment with his/her “broom,” and has become desireless – meaning: is without cravings, and [sees] “Atmano na tathA bhinnaṃ vishvamAtmavinirgataṃ” - that the universe which is within the Self is not different from the Self – one who, through this type of ascertainment, knows that “sarvaṃ brahmamayaṃ” [all is Brahman], and thereby becomes devoid of feeling “mine,” and in the end, being intoxicated in the Knowledge “I am That,” destroys the “me-ness” and becomes devoid of ego – and goes about in this way – that person attains the Eternal Bliss Peace. (This is the ultimate result of the spiritual act – the State of Perfection.)
