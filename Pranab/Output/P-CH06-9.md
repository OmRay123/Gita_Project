### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The one who sees the “suhrit,” “mitra,” “ari,” “udasin,” “madhyastha,” “dveshya,” “bandhu,” “sadhu” and “paapi” as all the same – it is that one who is greatest among those who are yogarudha. [See commentary below for definitions of the aforementioned terms in quotation - “” - marks.]

### Commentary 
 --- 
One who does good without the expectation of any return of good – that one is “suhrit.” One who does good out of affection – that one is “mitra.” One who causes enmity – that one is “ari.” When there is a dispute, the one who does not support any of the sides – that one is “udasin.” One who wishes for the good of all sides – that one is “madhyastha.” One who is despicable, unlikeable – that one is “dveshya.” One with whom there is some relationship – that one is “bandhu.” The one who performs Kriya according to the scriptures – that one is “sadhu.” And the one who does not abide by the scriptures – that one is “paapi.” Because the yogarudha yogi sees all of them to be the same, he/she is greatest.
