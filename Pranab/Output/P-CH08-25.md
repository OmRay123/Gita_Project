dhūmo rātris tathā kṛiṣhṇaḥ ṣhaṇ-māsā dakṣhiṇāyanam
tatra chāndramasaṁ jyotir yogī prāpya nivartate

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The “kaal” [see sloka 8:23] during which “dhum” [smoke], “ratri” [night], “krishna” [blackness] and the “dakshinayan shanmasa” [ordinary meaning: the six-month southern arc of the sun; see commentary below for spiritual meaning] takes place – if the yogi leaves the body during this “kaal,” he/she attains “chandraloka” [the moon-plane] and returns.

### Commentary 
 --- 
“Dhum” = smoke; “ratri” = the darkness of night. After the setting of the sun, until the span of seven and a half “dandas” [an ancient measure of time] is when the deepness of night takes place. And “krishna” means “black.” The mixed version of these three colors – meaning: if the yogi leaves the body while seeing a smokey, dark and blackish color – if that happens, then the yogi goes up to “Chandraloka” [the moon-plane], and again has to return. This is that which is called “dakshinayan shanmasa” or the “kumeru shanmasa” or the “kumeru gati.”
