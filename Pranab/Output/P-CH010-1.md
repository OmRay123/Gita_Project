### Bengali Translation

The Lord said: “O Mahabaho [mighty-armed one; Arjuna]! You feel dearness coming from Me to you through the words I speak to you. And so, as I desire the best for you, listen again to the teachings that I will speak to you now, regarding resolution with the Supreme Self. ”

### Commentary 
 --- 
In the 1st sloka of the 7th Chapter [of the Gita], the Lord said to Arjuna, “Hear now the way in which you can know Me completely and without any doubt.” Saying this, the Lord began to speak about His wonders, might, power, opulence/sovereignty etc. Through these [following] sayings: in Chapter Seven [of the Gita] – “raso’hamapsu kaunteya” [I am the liquidity in water, O son of Kunti] etc., in Chapter Eight – “adhiyojna’evamAtra” [I am the “adhiyajna” [Lord of offerings] indeed; see Chapter 8, slokas 3-4, item 6 for spiritual definition and explanation of “adhiyajna”] etc., and in Chapter Nine – “aham kraturahaṃ yajnah” [I am the rite, I am the fire sacrifice] etc., the Lord described the Self in a very concise manner. And in the last sloka of Chapter Nine, He also explained the method through which the Self can be attained. With this, the disciple Arjuna received the Lord’s endearment. But, in case all doubts are not removed because of such a summarized explanation, the Lord is again [or: further] elucidating the teachings regarding resolution with the Supreme Self.
