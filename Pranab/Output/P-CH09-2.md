### Commentary 
 --- 
This jnana – it is “rajavidya” [king of knowledges] = highest knowledge. (“Raja” [king; royal] means “highest/greatest,” and “vidya” [knowledge] means “that which makes one attain the Knowledge of Brahman.”) As its position is above everything, it is extremely secret, because, unless one goes up that high, it cannot be known. It is “uttama” [most high; most excellent] – meaning: via it, one attains “ut” (up above) + “tama” (settledness) [settledness up above]. It is “pavitra” [pure/sanctified] = without unsettledness/tiredness; “pratyaksha” [directly seen/known/realized] = illuminated and effulgent right in front of one’s own sight; “dharmya” [of righteousness] = without conflict/resistance – “avirodhAttu yo dharmah sa dharmah” – [meaning:] that which causes no conflict/resistance with anything/anyone – that is called “dharma.” “Dharmaṃ dhArayate prajAh” [people/subjects are held together by dharma]. “Praja” [subjects of a kingdom] means everything that arises in Prakriti. Thus: that which has emergence, staying and breaking down – that is “praja” [created beings/things]. Therefore, everything that has limitation – that is “praja.” The One Who is holding [or, the One Who is the Ground of] this limitedness – meaning: the One Who is Unlimited – it is He Who is “Dharma” [That Which holds]. That by which one can go to this Dharma – that is called “avagama” [knowable]. This Dharma – it is “Avyaya” [Inexhaustible] – meaning: Eternal. It [this Dharma] can be easily practiced. And by this, one can merge with the Inexhaustible.
