### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The one who knows Me to be without beginning and the Supreme Lord of all the worlds – that one, among those of the earthen-world, is without delusion, and is free of all sins.

### Commentary 
 --- 
In this beginning- and end-endowed world, no one and nothing is without beginning. Only “I” AM without beginning – the Original Cause. As the “karmi”’s [spiritual practitioner’s] karma [actions and their fruits] is reduced by doing karma [spiritual practice], as a result of that, that sadhak/karmi comes closer and closer to this “I”. As soon as that sadhak realizes that “I” is different from him/her and that It IS without beginning, right away, that sadhak casts off “moodhatva” [foolishness] (the one who is under the power of desire – that is the one who is “moodha” [stupid; fool; ignorant]), merges with “I”, leaves the dharma of the earthen-world, and knows “I” to be the Great Lord of creation. Thus, the change-bound restlessness (sin) no longer remains. That is because “I” AM the Origin, without birth. There is no appearance of sin in “I”; there is no sin in Me at all.
