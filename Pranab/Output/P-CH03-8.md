नियतं कुरु कर्म त्वं कर्म ज्यायो ह्यकर्मण: |
शरीरयात्रापि च ते न प्रसिद्ध्येदकर्मण: || 8||
niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ karma jyāyo hyakarmaṇaḥ
śharīra-yātrāpi cha te na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Perform the karma [act] with “niyata” [steadfastness], because “karma” [action] is greater than “akarma” [lack of action]. What is even more: without doing karma, you cannot even maintain your body.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Pretending to be a renunciate without being a “karmi” [one who performs action] (meaning: yogi) – if one stays in the state of the “akarma” [the lack of action] that comes about from that – because of all of the senses being tied to the world-oriented fruits of previously accumulated karma, the Supreme Thing cannot be attained. But if one does karma [yogic act] according to the teachings of guru, the inevitable result of that [act] is that karma [accumulation of results] is destroyed, and the “akarma” [non-doing] that comes about because of that – it is that very state that makes one attain the Supreme Thing. That is why doing karma [performing yogic action] is superior to the “akarma” [refraining from acting] of the “made-up renunciate.” “Karma” - the coming and going of prana within and without – is happening in each body. By abandoning that, no one at all can keep the body alive. By nature, everyone is forced to do this. When a technique is applied to that natural karma [act of prana movement], a supernatural, Eternal, Blissful Glory comes forth. That is why Srigurudev [Sri Krishna] has instructed that one has to perform karma [yogic act] with “niyata” [steadfastness]. Being steadfastly determined and disciplined according to instructions, moving prana in the direction of the Self – meaning: when one applies a technique to the naturally happening karma [prana moving in and out], one is doing “niyataṃ” [steadfast] karma
