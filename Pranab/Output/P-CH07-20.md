### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Due to many kinds of desires and being bereft of knowledge, people (those who engage in the worldly matters of wealth, family, fame, accomplishments etc.) become forced by their own natures to worship other gods with other methods, which are for the fulfillment of those desires. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
Not everyone can be “jnanavan” [see commentary to sloka 7:19]. This is because amongst thousands of people, perhaps one person is on the road to Truth. And again, amongst thousands of the ones that are on the road to Truth, perhaps one person attains the Knowledge of Unity. All others become deluded by the perception of “otherness,” and fall into the trap of the desires of wealth, family, fame, accomplishment etc., and their wisdom leaves them. And because of that [state of consciousness], they make efforts to fulfill such desires, which create karmic impressions [in the personal consciousness]. The accumulated karmic impressions from previous lives comprises their personal nature. It is because each person is ruled by one’s own particular nature [because of the previously accumulated karmic impressions] that they become engaged in particular actions/works – automatically [in a way beyond their control]. But, as they have lost themselves in the perception of otherness and are not able to grasp the Fundamental Supreme Truth, in order to fulfill the aforementioned desires, they take up [certain] methods that are written in the scriptures, such as fasting etc., as well as the worship of other gods that control the attainment of those aforementioned desires.
