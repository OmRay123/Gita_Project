### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The Lord said: “Illumination, endeavor, delusion – when all of these activities of the gunas are active together (towards the substances) – the one who does not hate, and while being unengaged, does not want (substances); the one who, being aloof, just remains as one is and is not perturbed by the activities of all of the gunas – (instead) ‘all are doing their own works according to their nature’ – knowing this, remains settled, and does not get restless; the one for whom pleasure and pain are the same; the one who is ‘svastha’ (settled in the Self); the one for whom a clod, stone and gold are the same; the one for whom dear and non-dear are the same; the one who is steady; the one for whom derision or praise [towards oneself by others] is the same; the one who remains in the same state [of steadiness] in honor and dishonor; the one for whom even friend and foe are the same; and the one who renounces all undertakings – that is the one who is said to be beyond the gunas.”

### Commentary 
 --- 
O Pandava [Arjuna]! This illumination that is the work of sattva, the endeavoring of rajas, the delusion of tamas – the one who does not have either attachment or repulsion towards these [this sentence is left incomplete in the original]. The qualities [the gunas] are themselves qualities, and the actions of the qualities are simply qualities in another form – the one who, understanding this, becomes a witness of the gunas, and in order to attain one’s own Self, renounces endeavoring, and in order to annihilate suffering and ignorance, does not long for withdrawal [either] – that is the one who is called “gunateet” [beyond the gunas].
Just as – if one sits up above in a high place, no one from below can touch that person – in the same way, the one who keeps oneself apart from the gunas and the works of the gunas, and does not feel obstacles or conflicts from the works of the gunas; the one who is “svastha” [abiding in the Self] – meaning: always settled in one’s True Self; the one for whom the perception of differences between pleasure and pain, in a clod (lump of earth), stone (rock), gold and such have disappeared; the one in whose antahkarana [inner being] no functionalities called dear or non-dear arise; the one for whom there is no feeling of derision and praise, honor and dishonor, enemy or friend – what to say, the one who has even renounced every kind of endeavor (the one who does not begin any kind of thing) – that is the one who is called “gunateet” [beyond the gunas].
