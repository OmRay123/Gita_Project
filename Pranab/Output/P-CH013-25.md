### Commentary 
 --- 
(The words that have been said about Prakriti, the mutations of Prakriti, the permutations, and Purush – all of that can be known by simply witnessing the Self. In these two slokas [13:25-26] the Lord is showing the differences of the gradually greater levels of [spiritual] capability according to the stages of sadhana, and is speaking about the methods of witnessing the Self.)

When, upon having received instructions from Srigurudev, one progresses in sadhana and the force-strength of prana-driving in the sushumna becomes easy and natural, then, if one does 1728 chaturthik pranayams, the mind will rise up from the worldly experience and the senses, fall into the intellect, and one will have realization of the Self. That process of having Self-realization – that is called “dhyan.” Going on practicing in this way, when the world-oriented current of functionalities is completely controlled [by the sadhak], then, as one wishes, one can separate and take that current away from the weariness of Prakriti, fill it with energy, throw it into Purush and take up endless settledness. This is one type of sadhana [practice]. In this too, the settledness in the Self and the stoppage of the samsaric state come about. (The beginning part of this type of sadhana is “samkhya-yoga” – meaning: “jnana-yoga,” and the beginning part of samkhya-yoga is “karma-yoga.” That is why the Lord has mentioned samkhya-yoga and karma-yoga right after this [“dhyana-yoga”]. The perfected yogis take whichever one of these they wish and witness the Self; however, the practitioner is perfected by rising through the stages in sequence.)
