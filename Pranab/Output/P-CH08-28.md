### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The beneficent fruits that are spoken about in the Vedas, [the beneficent fruits that are associated with] yajnas [fire rituals], austerities and charity – the yogi, knowing all of the mentioned benefits, goes beyond all of them and attains the Original and Supreme Abode (the State of Vishnu).

### Commentary 
 --- 
The beneficent fruits that have been spoken about regarding the rites of the Vedas, the rites of yajnas [fire rituals], the actions of austerities and the activities of charity – all of those bring one back to the earthen-world after the fruits of those actions have been enjoyed in places like heaven and such. Knowing and understanding that, and therefore rejecting all of that, the yogi arrives at the yogi’s own Supreme Abode, the place from where the yogi came in the beginning, that Original Abode – the State of Vishnu.
