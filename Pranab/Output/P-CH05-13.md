### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The embodied one, using the discerning intellect, casts off all karma [acts and their outcomes] and becomes “vashee” [controlled by the Self], and in the city of nine doors (in the body), abides in happiness, without doing anything and without causing anything to be done.

### Commentary 
 --- 
After the sadhak attains the state of “naishtiki-shanti,” he/she becomes a “samyami”-witness in an extremely subtle state of being (see Chapter 4, sloka 26). At this time, as the intelligence of the Self dawns, all karma is renounced – meaning: along with the destruction of activities of the mind's volition, all of the prana-Kriyas of the six chakras also fall off. Thus: two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, mouth, anus and the sex organ – all of the activities of these nine doors of the body stop and the relationship to the external worldly experience is completely finished off. Then the sadhak becomes “vashee” [controlled by the Self]. (This is the Kriya of the “I”-field.) At this time, because of the extinguishing of the two vrittis of volition and certainty, even while residing in the body, the sadhak has no activities remaining at all. There is only the abidance in happiness – meaning: abidance in the Revelatory Light in the Beautiful Space, in the Bliss of the Self. [This is the state of “vijitatma” [victorious over oneself; in the commentary to 5:7, the words “victorious over the body” is used] as stated in sloka 7 [of this Chapter 5].]5 Although there is no activity in the state of being “vashee,” the power of activity and the full knowledge of “I” or the knowledge “ahang” [or: ahaṃ] remains.
