### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
“O Varshneya [Sri Krishna]! How is it that, even when one is without desire, one becomes involved in sinful ways as if being forced to do so, and by what or whom does one become thusly engaged?”

### Commentary 
 --- 
The Kriyavan sadhak has understood quite well that: by performing Kriya according to the teachings in slokas 30 and 33 [of this Chapter 3], the sense of stillness comes about; it is then possible to forget the world/creation; one attains the way to the Self. But during the performance of Kriya, the sadhak sees that: Kriya is going on; it is going on well; the attention on Kutastha is quite well established; there is not even a little bit of desire to leave that and look elsewhere; but even when there is no desire, it seems that, against one's will, someone/some power pulls the helpless mind to other directions, destroys its focus and puts it in all kinds of restlessness. Thus, through self-enquiry, the sadhak is searching to find out – why does this happen? What is the cause? (See Chapter 10, sloka 37 for the meaning of the word “Varshneya.”)
