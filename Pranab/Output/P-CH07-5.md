अपरेयमितस्त्वन्यां प्रकृतिं विद्धि मे पराम् |
जीवभूतां महाबाहो ययेदं धार्यते जगत् || 5||
apareyam itas tvanyāṁ prakṛitiṁ viddhi me parām
jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Mahabaho [mighty-armed one; Arjuna]! This [the aggregate of attributes mentioned in sloka 7:4] is “apara” [non-beyond]. But besides this, there is a self-operating Life-Nature of Mine Who is the Foundation of this creation. Know Her to be “Para” [beyond; Supreme]. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
The prakriti that is divided into eight parts – that prakriti is “jada” [form-bound]. Therefore, it is impure, worthless and the cause of the bondage to samsara. Thus, it is inferior. But the Prakriti that is the Consciousness Itself, and the Cause of Life, the One Who presides from the Brahmarandhra to the Muladhar, Who holds and sustains the creation in the form of the body – for which reason She has taken the name of “Jagaddhatri” [the Holder of creation] – that Consciousness-Prakriti is “Para” (Supreme). The sum of it is this: Prakriti is of two types – Para and apara. Para is Consciousness-Prakriti; apara is “jada” [form-bound] prakriti. Apara is the field; Para is the Knower of the field, the Foundation of the field. Therefore, Para is Superior; apara is inferior. The sadhak is now directly experiencing all of this on his/her own within the sadhak's own body. (See Illustration No. 5 in the first section [Introduction].)
