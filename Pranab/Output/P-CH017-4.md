The sattvic persons worship the gods and such. The rajasic persons worship celestial spirits and powerful supernatural beings, and the other tamasic persons worship lower spirits of the dead and ghosts.

### Commentary

When faith arises for the sattvic, it is for Purush and for gods and goddesses. When faith arises for the rajasic, it is for celestial spirits and powerful supernatural beings. And the tamasic, when their faith is in operation, worship ghosts and the lower spirits of the dead.
