### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Partha [Arjuna]! That by which the unintelligent ones are not able to be free of sleep, fear, grief, depression and conceit – that is verily tamasic steadfastness. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
And when in the waking and dreaming states I sit about dreaming, being with fear, grief, depression and conceit ([and] deludedly delighting in these) – to let go of even one of these, it feels like I am losing everything – this kind of power to hold on that is senseless – O Arjuna! – this is that which is called tamasic steadfastness.
