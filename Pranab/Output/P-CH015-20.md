### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Anagh [sinless one; Arjuna]! I have now stated this most secret scripture in this summarized way. O Bharat [Arjuna], after understanding this (anyone) becomes a knower of all, and succeeds in all that there is to be done.

### Commentary 
 --- 
O sinless one! That, which is the greatest secret, from which even Maya Herself is revealed, but is the One that She does not have the power to reveal – I have just explained to you that teaching of Brahman through conversation in this chapter. The intelligent ones use their intellect with this teaching, and succeed in all that is to be done – meaning: the Settledness in Brahman that is there after all of the doing that there is – they get that, verily. And for them, there is no space/need to find meaning/value in that which needs to be done.
