### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Lord! Seeing this previously unseen (Cosmic Form), I am delighted. But my mind/heart is unsettled with fear. Therefore, please just show me that [more pleasing] Form. O God of gods! O Abode of creation itself! Be appeased.

### Commentary 
 --- 
What I had never seen before – seeing that Form of Yours, I am ecstatic. But by falling into the torrential waves of this Form without having any previous connection, my mind/heart is unsettled with fear. O Abode of creation itself! Be pleased with me. Show me that shadowless, Radiant, Godly Form from before.
