### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
When one sees the [apparent] separateness of the aggregate of phenomena and living beings existing in a singular place (residing in the One Self), and when one sees that all phenomena and living beings expand forth from That Itself (from that One Self Itself), then (that being) becomes Brahman. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
“This, that, another” – these separate forms of phenomena and living beings that you are seeing – that is the dharma of Prakriti’s making and withdrawing. Removing this perception of separateness from the inner being, all phenomena and living beings become one and expand forth. And the great expanse is actually Brahman. That Brahman is verily “I”. When the spiritually knowledgeable sadhak [aspirant] performs the yajna of Brahman as described in the fourth chapter [of the Bhagavad Gita], then the perception of seeing the Self in all becomes established, and one sees that in the midst of the ocean, there are infinite waves giving off the foam and bubbles of phenomena which are established in One Self alone, and it is from the One Self that they are spreading out in many different forms. When this direct vision is had – it is then that the sadhak attains the State of Brahman.
