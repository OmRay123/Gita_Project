### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Parantapa [Arjuna]! There is no end to My Glorious Manifestations. Nevertheless, I have now spoken to you in brief about these extensive Glories. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
Parantapa means: one who has the power to defeat the strength or power of another. All of these Maya-filled Manifestations cannot come to an end unless Maya is subdued and “I” predominates. (See “mAmeva ye prapadyante” [those who surrender to Me; Bhagavad Gita Chapter 7:14].) There is no beginning or end to these Manifestations. Nevertheless, I just told you about a few of them. Uddeshatah [with the intention of] – with the intention to include – meaning: by speaking about the primary [Manifestations], it is intended to include all [Manifestations].
