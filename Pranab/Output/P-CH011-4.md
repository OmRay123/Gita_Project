O Lord [Sri Krishna]! If You feel that I am fit and capable of seeing That, then O Yogeshvara [Lord of Yogis; Sri Krishna], show me that Inexhaustible Self of Yours. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
O Lord! O Friend of the desperate and downtrodden! O Yogeshvara [Lord of Yogis]! (“Yogeshvara” means one who has no diminishing of the yogic state whether that being is in the “I” or the “you” state , or in whichever perception that being may be.) If I am deserving and fit to see that “I” State of Yours while I am in the “you-consciousness,” then show me, inside and outside together, the Inexhaustible State of the Self.
