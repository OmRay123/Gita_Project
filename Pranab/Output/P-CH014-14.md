### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
When sattva guna has taken over – when the jiva dies, then he/she will attain the planes of the highly knowledgable luminaries. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
If any embodied being dies during the time of experiencing the previously mentioned qualities of sattva guna – if that happens – the luminous planes (the abodes of enjoying [higher] pleasures) of those who are knowledgable about Mahat and such – that being goes to those planes. (See Chapter 8, sloka 6 [of the Bhagavad Gita].)
