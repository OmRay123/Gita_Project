### Commentary 
 --- 
Having some abilities gained by beginner’s practice during Kriya, falling off of the path of Brahman and having the kind of samadhi [absorption] in a state that is a combination of the reflection of ancient sages and ancestors – the kind of surrender that happens with that – that is the giving of suffering. This is because: the effort was made to merge in Brahman, but surrender happened in the plane of gods, sages and ancestors. The fruit that came about is the enjoyment of heaven and such, and then a re-entrance into samsara – once again, this conflict of laughter and tears. Thus, know that this kind of giving is known as “rajasic charity.”
