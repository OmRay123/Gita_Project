### Bengali Translation

Sanjaya spoke: “In this way, I listened to this astonishing and thrilling dialogue between Mahatma Vasudeva [Sri Krishna] and Partha [Arjuna].”

### Commentary 
 --- 
Now, the essential meanings of all of the scriptures [the Bhagavad Gita’s meaning] are rising up together and springing forth to their conclusion in the inner perception. Whatever is experienced happens verily in the antahkarana [the four aspects of personal consciousness, including the unknowing [blind] part of the mind]. That is why Dhritarashtra (the mind [in the form of the blind king]) is being addressed, and this is being said: “In this way, I have heard the astonishing and thrilling dialogue of questions and answers between Vasudeva (Brahman as the Omnipresence) and Arjuna (the confused state of the jiva [individual] bound by the bondage of Maya).”
