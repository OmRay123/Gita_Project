### Prose 
 --- 
मया ततमिदं सर्वं जगदव्यक्तमूर्तिना |
मत्स्थानि सर्वभूतानि न चाहं तेष्ववस्थित: || 4||
mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā
mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni na chāhaṁ teṣhvavasthitaḥ

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
I pervade this entire creation which is in the form of “avyakta” [in this case: unexpressed; see commentary below for the particular meaning of “avyakta” related to this sloka]. All phenomena exist in Me; I do not reside in them.

### Commentary 
 --- 
“I” who am looking over the creation from the Settledness in Brahman – this is just like the Sun and the Earth. The Earth is unrevealed [unseen without light], and the Sun is self-revealed. Both of these are separate and exist very far apart from each other. But, just as when the rays of the Sun blend with all of the things and thus those things become more revealed, yet the light of the Sun is not bound to those things – in the same way, even if I mix with the limited phenomena of Prakriti in the most pervasive way, I actually do not mix with the phenomena. Thus, even though phenomena, living beings and such are in Me, because they do not look towards “I”, they cannot become “I”. I Am such an Expression that it is through My Light that those limited ones of “avyakta” [unexpressed; does not exist] or “aprakash” [unrevealed; without light] have [pretended to] leave behind whatever materiality [or: physicality] they had in their nature, and are pretending that they are not unexpressed or material [or: physical] but are Expression Itself. However, all that there is other than Me, all of that is unrevealed [does not exist without My Light]. Therefore, the creation indeed is “aprakash” [unrevealed; without light] or “avyakta” [unexpressed; does not exist].
