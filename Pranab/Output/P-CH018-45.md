By endeavoring in each one’s particular duty (ordained according to rightfulness), human beings attain perfection. How the human being attains perfection in being engaged in work that is natural to that person – now hear about that. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
In the beginning, the sadhak [aspirant] will examine him/herself and find out “what is this person?” Whichever caste the sadhak’s mind accepts him/herself to be – he/she will perform the dutiful work according to that. Because brahmin is higher than all others, the other three castes should not perform actions/duties that are appropriate for brahmins. One should engage in works appropriate to one’s own caste, and endeavor to rise up to the level of the character of the caste just above one’s own. One should not try to skip this and jump to try to be greater. Being engaged in this kind of action, one attains “samsiddhi” (Supreme Blessing). How that Blessing is attained – that is being said (in the very next sloka [18:46]). Listen.
