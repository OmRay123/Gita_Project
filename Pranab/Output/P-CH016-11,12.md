### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Taking up endless and continuous anxiety-bringing concerns until the time of death, having succumbed to the enjoyments of lust, thinking that the enjoyment of lusts is the supreme purpose of life – being certain like this about [wrongful] deeds, those asuric people who have succumbed to lust and are bound by hundreds and hundreds of ties, in order to enjoy lusts, desire to gather masses and masses of wealth, even in wrongful ways.

### Commentary 
 --- 
By bringing a demi-god under my power through occult practices, I will build a city in the sky. And entering into water, land, the netherworld and the abyss of the Earth, I will endeavor greatly to enjoy sensual pleasures. Nurturing this kind of endless wanting, [the asuras] go on trying for these things and spend time like this until the end time of death. Being entangled in the snare of wishfulness (and failing again and again), and being in the states of lust and anger, in order to facilitate the enjoyments of lustful indulgence, [the asuras] endeavor to take from others (take others’ wealth), and engage in unrighteous and deceitful and such actions.
