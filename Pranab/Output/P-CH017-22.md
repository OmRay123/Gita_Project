 --- 
In the world (in the wrong place), when I am engrossed in the worldly experience outside, at a time like this (at the wrong time), the surrendering that is done (by having contempt for the Self and succumbing) to the things to be enjoyed (to unworthy recipients), while being intoxicated by the enjoyments (without caring) – that is called “tamasic charity.”
