### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Many pure ones, through “gyana” [knowledge] and “tapasya” [intense practice], having become devoid of attachments and devoid of anger, and having their hearts solely set on Me, have attained My very State.

### Commentary 
 --- 
I am Brahman. Brahman is all. This firmly grasped conviction is (pure personal) “gyana” [knowledge]. And the state that comes upon being “samaṃ kAyashirogreevaṃ” [aligning body, head and neck], turning the tongue backwards, clenching teeth upon teeth, and penetrating prana into the middle of the eyebrows – that is “tapah” [intense practice]. It is via these - “gyana” and “tapah” - that the chitta is purified. Those who have attained the purification of chitta in this way are not just one or two. Many, upon knowing the Divine Births and Actions of the “I”, and thereby becoming devoid of attachments, devoid of fear, devoid of anger, and becoming “I”-filled, have taken shelter in “I” Itself – meaning: having taken shelter in Kutastha Chaitanya Paramatman Beloved Deity, have themselves finished themselves into the Self. Dear sadhak, [the feeling] that today you are the only one who is the traveler on this Path – it is not like that. Many have traveled, and attained the Supreme Destiny! What is the need to fear?
