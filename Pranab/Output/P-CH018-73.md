O Achyut [the Indestructible One; Sri Krishna]! Delusion has been destroyed. By Your Blessings I have attained wisdom. Free of doubt, I am now settled. I will follow Your teaching.  

### Commentary 
 --- 
The grateful Arjuna (the sadhak) is saying, “O Achyut [the Indestructible One; Sri Krishna]! The samsara-delusion that is the root cause of all purposeless perception has been torn away by Your Grace. The Remembrance of my Self – which I had forgotten – I now have it. My doubts have been destroyed. Now I am Settled in the Self of all the selves in all of the beings/phenomena, the Infinite Brahman Itself (in My own Being). There is nothing remaining that can be said to be my duty. Now I will act according to Your teaching.

With God’s Grace, grateful for the realization, the sadhak became free of doubt, and again settled into the purpose of the sadhana-war. The sadhak sat up according to the instructed way.
