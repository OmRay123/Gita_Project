### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
That action which is ever ordained, and which is done without desire, without attachment to/from the doer, and without like and dislike – that is called sattvic action.

### Commentary 
 --- 
When, due to cultivation, prana moves unabated in the path of Brahman, when there is no contact or touching of desire, affection or repulsion, what to say – when there is even no arising of the desire for the results of the action – that is that which is called sattvic action.
