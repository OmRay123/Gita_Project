### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The one who does not rejoice (at getting a dear thing), does not become indignant/hateful (at getting an undesired thing), does not grieve (over the loss of something good), does not long for (that which one has no right to have), and the one who has left behind good and evil, and is devoted – that is the being who is dear to Me. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
The devoted sadhak who is not happy at getting something good, nor indignant/hateful at getting something that is not good, who does not grieve for dear ones, does not either inwardly or outwardly lust after objects to which he/she has no right, in whose heart the desire to establish virtue or vice does not arise at all – the one who is endowed with these states – that is the one who, verily, is dear to Me. Dear sadhak, see. These states that are spoken about in the aforementioned passages – what it is to be like that – to be “I” is the very same thing.
