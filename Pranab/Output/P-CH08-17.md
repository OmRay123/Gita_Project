सहस्रयुगपर्यन्तमहर्यद्ब्रह्मणो विदु: |

sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ
rātriṁ yuga-sahasrāntāṁ te ’ho-rātra-vido janāḥ

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Those who know that one day of Brahmaa is one thousand “yugas” [ordinary meaning: epochs; see commentary below for spiritual meaning and explanation], and that the end of one thousand yugas is the night of Brahmaa – those are the persons known as “ahoratravid” [the knowers of day and night].

### Commentary 
 --- 
“Yuga” means “couple.” One is drawn, and another is expelled. The play of exhalation and inhalation in this body – meaning: the activity of expelling and drawing [respectively] – happens 21,600 times in the eight divisions of the [24-hour] day. As the sadhak goes on doing Kriya, when exhalation and inhalation go on happening in an extremely subtle way within the body, when the inhalation and exhalation becomes 1000 in the day and 1000 at night – when breathing becomes reduced to these 2000 times, the sadhak attains settledness in Brahman ([see] Chapter 2, slokas 71-72 [of the Pranab Gita]). Experiencing that and knowing it, the sadhak becomes a “brahmin.” Therefore, attaining the knowledge of the manifestation of the day and the non-manifestation of the night – this manifestation and non-manifestation – the sadhak becomes an “ahoratravid” [knower of the day and night] – meaning: what “settledness in Brahman” is – the sadhak ends up knowing that as well. And what the subject matter of the created world is – the sadhak ends up knowing that as well.
