रजस्तमश्चाभिभूय सत्त्वं भवति भारत |
रज: सत्त्वं तमश्चैव तम: सत्त्वं रजस्तथा || 10||
rajas tamaśh chābhibhūya sattvaṁ bhavati bhārata
rajaḥ sattvaṁ tamaśh chaiva tamaḥ sattvaṁ rajas tathā

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Bharat [Arjuna]! Sattva guna rises forth by subduing the guna-duo of rajas and tamas (does its work of enjoining one to contentment/pleasure, knowledge and such); rajoguna rises forth by subduing the guna-duo of sattva and tamas (does its work of enjoining one to thirst [want], attachment and such); and tamoguna rises forth by subduing the guna-duo of sattva and rajas (does its work of enjoining one to madness, laziness and such).

### Commentary 
 --- 
O Bharat [Arjuna]! These three gunas that have now been spoken about – none of them can work if they rise up at the same time. When sattva is predominant, then rajas and tamas – both are subdued. And again, the time that rajas manifests, sattva and tamas are subdued. Similarly, at the time of the operation of tamas, rajas and sattva experience inactivity.
