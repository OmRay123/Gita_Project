### Prose 
 --- 
त्याज्यं दोषवदित्येके कर्म प्राहुर्मनीषिण: |
यज्ञदानतप:कर्म न त्याज्यमिति चापरे || 3||
tyājyaṁ doṣha-vad ity eke karma prāhur manīṣhiṇaḥ
yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyam iti chāpare

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Some “manishee[s]” [sages; see commentary below for deeper definition] say that karmas [rites] are error-bound and therefore are actions to be given up. Some others say that the actions of yajna [rites], charity and austerities are actions that should not be given up.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Those who have brought their “mana[s]” [mind[s]] under control are “manishee[s].” Those “manishees,” upon tasting the nectar of the Settledness of Brahman, do not even like the vibrations of “karma” (the moving of prana [yogically]). So for them, “karma” [yogic act] is an action to be given up. And others whose minds have not been brought under control – they say that yajna [rites], austerities, charity, Kriya are not things to be given up.
