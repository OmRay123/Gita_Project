### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
I see you as: without beginning, middle or end, with limitless Power, with infinite numbers of arms, with eyes of the moon and the sun, with fire blazing from Your mouth, burning all of this universe with the heat of Your fire. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
You have no beginning, end or middle. You are Limitless. There is no end to Your Splendor, Glory, Capability. You are Limitless. Your Active Power is present equally in everything/everywhere. You are Limitless. You are more Ferocious than ferocity itself, and more Beautiful than beauty itself – the Self witnessing the Self. Your mouth is blazing with flames of fire. With Your Energy, this creation is burning ([but] does not melt). I am seeing this.
