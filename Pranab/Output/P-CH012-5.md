### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The difficulties are greater for those who are fixed with their attention on the Unexpressed, because of still remaining with body-vanity/body-identification and, at the same time, going on the path of the Unexpressed. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
The sadhak is observing: those who say that they are spiritually directed, yet have not let go of body-vanity/body-identification – those who are in this condition – there is no end to their difficulties. They remain bound in the “I and mine” condition. This is because all of the actions of samsara have to do with “mine.” With great practice, one can let go of “mine” during these actions and try to fall into “I”, but unknowingly, one [still] falls into “mine” [anyway]. Therefore, one does not go into “I”.
