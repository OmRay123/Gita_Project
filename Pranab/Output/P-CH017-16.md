### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Happiness of mind, gentleness (non-cruelness), silence, abiding in the Self, and purity of inner states – these are called “austerities of mind.”

### Commentary 
 --- 
“Manahprasad” – the tension-free and happy state of mind. “Saumyatva” – the settled state of all four aspects of the antahkarana [mind as a whole]. The state in which the function of speech remains unmoving (but not like the conditions of death, fainting or unconsciousness) – that is verily “mauna” [non-speaking]. Being settled in the Self (staying in the Self as Oneself) is “atmavinigraha” [abiding in the Self]. The state that is there in the antahkarana when the mutations of Maya have been cut away – that is verily the state of “bhavasamshuddhi” [purity in the inner states]. All of these are called “austerities of mind.”
