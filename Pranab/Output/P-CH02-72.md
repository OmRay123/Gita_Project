एषा ब्राह्मी स्थिति: पार्थ नैनां प्राप्य विमुह्यति |
स्थित्वास्यामन्तकालेऽपि ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृच्छति || 72||
eṣhā brāhmī sthitiḥ pārtha naināṁ prāpya vimuhyati
sthitvāsyām anta-kāle ’pi brahma-nirvāṇam ṛichchhati

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
This is that which is “brahmisthiti” [establishment in Brahman]. Upon attaining this, one does not have to be deluded again. Even if one stays in this [samsara], one attains Brahman-Nirvana at the end of one's life.

### Commentary 
 --- 
If one goes about after having attained the state described in the previous sloka [71], the state that comes about – that is verily the State of Brahman-Knowledge - “brahmisthiti” [establishment in Brahman]. Because everything becomes Brahman in this “brahmisthiti,” even if one is with all external sense-matters – because there is no perception of differences, the inner and the outer become one, and one does not get deluded. Thus, in this state, even if one is living in the life of the world, at the time of leaving the body [death], “yatrayatra mano jAti tatraiva brahma lakshyate” - meaning: because everything is seen as Brahman, one attains the “no-return way” - Brahman-Nirvana.
