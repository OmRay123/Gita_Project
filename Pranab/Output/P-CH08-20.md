परस्तस्मात्तु भावोऽन्योऽव्यक्तोऽव्यक्तात्सनातन: |
य: स सर्वेषु भूतेषु नश्यत्सु न विनश्यति || 20||
paras tasmāt tu bhāvo ’nyo ’vyakto ’vyaktāt sanātanaḥ
yaḥ sa sarveṣhu bhūteṣhu naśhyatsu na vinaśhyati

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
But, “another Avyakta Bhava” [another Inexpressible Beingness], which is Eternal, which exists beyond Avyakta [Prakriti as the Inexpressible] – even if all beings and phenomena are destroyed, He is never destroyed.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Therefore, you are Brahman, Eternal while with the expressible and the Inexpressible. You are existing within these living beings and phenomena, yet you are “Avyakta” [the “other” Inexpressible; the Self] – meaning: you are beyond the senses, and you do not change over with the changing over of living beings and phenomena. You do not destroy anyone at all, and neither can you be destroyed by anyone. “I Am as I Am. Like the way that the flow of water and time are – birth and death are like that.”
