Arjuna said: “The birth of the sun was in earlier times, and Your birth was later [than the sun's birth]. How am I to understand that You taught this yoga to the sun at the beginning?”

### Commentary 
 --- 
The sadhak sees in Kriya that in the Chidakash [sky of consciousness], an extraordinary sphere of light shines forth at first. Afterwards, within that sphere, the appearance of an unimaginably beautiful and enchanting bindu [luminous spot] gradually becomes an all-entrancing Deific Form. That sphere of light is Vivasvan [Spiritual Sun] and that Deific Form is, indeed, Kutastha Brahman – Srigurudev. So – see how the appearance of Vivasvan is first and the appearance of Kutastha Chaitanya is afterwards. For this reason, the Light of Pure Consciousness (the current of Knowingness) first falls in Vivasvan, and afterwards, It moves onto Kutastha Chaitanya. The sadhak is actually realizing [this aspect] in this way, but his/her knowing this matter through hearing about it is being understood in another way. Thus, because of doubt coming about, the sadhak is investigating within: how is possible that the Light of the Self moves into Vivasvan from Kutastha?
