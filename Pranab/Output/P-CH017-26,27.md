### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
For the states of “sadbhava” [goodness; state of existence] and “sadhubhava” [sagaciousness], the aspect of “Sat” [the word] is used. O Partha [Arjuna]! The word “Sat” is also connected to auspicious (beneficent) acts. The settledness [realization of the act] that is there in yajna, austerities and charity – that is called “Sat” [that which is “here and present”]. The act dedicated to “That” (meaning: performed for the sake of pleasing the Lord) is also called “Sat” [act belonging to Truth].

### Commentary 
 --- 
“Sadbhava” and “sadhubhava” [see Bengali translation above] – both of these are one thing. “Sa” = fine breath; “a” [long form] = “aasakti” [connectedness]; “dha” = “dhriti” [holding]; and “u” = “sthiti” [being established]. When, upon being connected to the subtle/fine breath, the settledness is held – that is when the meaning of the word “sadhu” [sage] opens up. Thus, “sadbhava” or “sadhubhava” means the Settled State of Only-ness. And the act that is done for the sake of that kind of settledness (the driving of vayu [vital-force] in the path of Emancipation), O Partha [Arjuna; the sadhak]! – that is also given the name of “Sat.” Similarly, the settledness that comes about from [doing] yajna, austerity and charity, where not a bit of restlessness remains – that is also called “Sat.” And that driving of vayu (in the path of Brahman) that is done for that yajna, those “austerities and offerings” – that is also known in the community of spirituality by the word “Sat.” “Sat” is the utterance of settledness/existence and the Shakti of the state of manifestation. In the path of pravritti [outward-going life] this manifestation appears as the universe, and in the path of nivritti [inward-going life], the manifestation is the realization of Only-ness.
