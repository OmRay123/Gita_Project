### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
All of those sons of Dhritarasthra, along with the kings of the world, are entering into You with torrential force, and Bhishma, Drona and “Sutaputra” (Karna), along with the great warriors from our side as well, are going into Your terrifying mouth through Your awfully fearsome teeth. I am seeing that the heads of some (among them) are being crushed and that they are stuck between those teeth. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
Unless a stake is driven through the worldly experience in the inner being, no one can ever have the respite to look towards Liberation. The Liberation-desiring sadhak thinks of the worldly experience in the inner being – comprised of lust and such – as being one’s adversary, and takes discrimination/discernment, detachment and such as one’s own. The sadhak even practices/serves those [qualities of detachment etc.]. But as one goes on rising up, so do those things that are “one’s own” start to fall off one by one; it is experienced directly. This is because there cannot be Liberation as long as there are things remaining that are endowed with beginnings and ends (meaning: the idea of “avoiding” [disconnecting from absolutely everything; or keeping something good and discarding the bad] is meaningless). Thus, in the beginning, the things that appear to be “against” one have to be rooted out, directly. [However], whatever is born of the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness], all of that is distortion [of Reality]. There is no good and bad attributed to them. The worldly experience is desire, and that “that Liberation, oh I just about have it” – that is also desire. Some a little before, some a little later – but I see that no one is being spared from burning in the Fire of Brahman. The reflected consciousness, impressions, desire to do duty, discrimination/discernment, detachment – all are going away.
