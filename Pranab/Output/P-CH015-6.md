### Prose 
 --- 
न तद्भासयते सूर्यो न शशाङ्को न पावक: |
यद्गत्वा न निवर्तन्ते तद्धाम परमं मम || 6||
na tad bhāsayate sūryo na śhaśhāṅko na pāvakaḥ
yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
That Substance cannot be revealed by the sun, cannot be revealed by the moon, nor can fire reveal It. Going where (yogis) do not again return – that verily is My “Param Dham” [Supreme Abode] (My Being).

### Commentary 
 --- 
Even being the great grouping of light that it is, the sun cannot reveal this “That-Substance” by its own light, nor can the moon, nor can fire. This is because none of these have the power to reach that “That-Substance.” But this Vishnu-Substance, through the effect of Its own Light, reveals those three luminescences. When this “That-Vishnu” Supreme Substance is attained, there is no return to samsara. This Substance/State is verily the “Param Dham” [Supreme Abode] of “I” (the place of Rest).
