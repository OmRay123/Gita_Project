### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
That which (the well-known types are known by everyone), through contact with the worldly experience and the senses, looks nectarous/immortal in the beginning and changes to being poison-like – that happiness is said to be rajasic. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
And that happiness that rises up from the contact with the worldly experience and senses, the taste of which everyone has known by partaking, which first seems like nectar/immortality (like the cultivating of lust and greed, partaking in them) but results in a poison-like experience – like: taking away strength, potency, beauty, intuitive perception, intelligence, wealth, health, enthusiasm and such, bringing infirmity in youth, bringing suffering through apparent pleasures – that is that which is called rajasic happiness.
