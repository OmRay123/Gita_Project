tamas tv ajñāna-jaṁ viddhi mohanaṁ sarva-dehinām
pramādālasya-nidrābhis tan nibadhnāti bhārata

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Bharat [Arjuna]! However, tamoguna arises from ignorance. Know that it is for this reason that every embodied being is deluded/confused. It binds one through madness, laziness/indolence, and sleep.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Prakriti has a part where the power of veiling is predominant. It is from this [condition of] ignorance that tamoguna emerges. This ignorance-born tamas deludes/confuses all living beings, makes them lose themselves, and imprisons them through madness, laziness/indolence and sleep.

(These are statements regarding the tamas guna that is born of Prakriti. That which is “pure tamas” – that is [actually] the ending place for Prakriti [or: the place of repose for Prakriti], that which is [also] called “Kaivalya Sthiti” [being established in Only-ness]. That is Alone, Emancipated, or, is the Settledness in Brahman. Prakritic activities do not reach there.)
