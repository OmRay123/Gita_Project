यो मामेवमसम्मूढो जानाति पुरुषोत्तमम् |
स सर्वविद्भजति मां सर्वभावेन भारत || 19||
yo mām evam asammūḍho jānāti puruṣhottamam
sa sarva-vid bhajati māṁ sarva-bhāvena bhārata

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Bharat [Arjuna]! The one who has become free of ignorance in the stated way, and thus knows Me as Purushottama – that one becomes the knower of all, and is absorbed in Me [or: meditating on Me; worshipping Me] in all ways [or: in all states of being]. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
O Bharat [Arjuna; the sadhak]! The fortunate sadhak who, through the strength of sadhana, cuts through the delusional intoxication of Maya and directly sees this “I” (Purushottama) – meaning: tearing apart the net of the matters of Maya, comes into this “I” – that being becomes a knower of all – meaning: that which is the knowledge of all knowledge – knowing that, becomes absorbed in the meditation/worship of “I” – meaning: in all states of being, that being cannot see anything other than “I”.
