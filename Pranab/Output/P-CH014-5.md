### Prose 
 --- 
सत्त्वं रजस्तम इति गुणा: प्रकृतिसम्भवा: |
निबध्नन्ति महाबाहो देहे देहिनमव्ययम् || 5||
sattvaṁ rajas tama iti guṇāḥ prakṛiti-sambhavāḥ
nibadhnanti mahā-bāho dehe dehinam avyayam

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O mighty-armed one [Arjuna]! Even though they are “avyakta” [not apparent], sattva, rajas, tamas – these three gunas [primal qualities], being with Prakriti, bind the embodied one in the body.

### Commentary 
 --- 
It has already been said, “I am not the embodied one”; “I am not the body”; “the ‘I’ does not have a body”; “I am not a jiva [embodied soul]”; “I am the Immutable Consciousness.” So, what are the three gunas [primal qualities]? And again, how do they bring the Undiminishing “I” to the bondage of the body? That is why, in order to explain, it is being said that sattva, rajas and tamas – these three gunas rise from Prakriti. O mighty-armed one! (The one who can bring everyone under control by wrapping his/her two arms around them – that is the one who is “mighty-armed.”) These three gunas smear mutations even onto the Undiminishing and Immutable, bring one into the body, and bind one as an embodied being.
