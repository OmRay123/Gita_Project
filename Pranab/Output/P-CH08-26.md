शुक्लकृष्णे गती ह्येते जगत: शाश्वते मते |
एकया यात्यनावृत्तिमन्ययावर्तते पुन: || 26||
śhukla-kṛiṣhṇe gatī hyete jagataḥ śhāśhvate mate
ekayā yātyanāvṛittim anyayāvartate punaḥ

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
These two ways of the bright and dark paths have been known from beginning-less time. Via one [bright], there is no return; via the other [dark], there is return.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Dear sadhak! Now take a look. Here are your ways of darkness and brightness. Understand this. See it and through steady and firm practice master this in such a way that at the required time when this must be applied, your beneficence remains “hastAmakalavat” – [meaning:] in your hands. This bright path allows one to never return, and the dark path makes one return.
