कर्मजं बुद्धियुक्ता हि फलं त्यक्त्वा मनीषिण: |
जन्मबन्धविनिर्मुक्ता: पदं गच्छन्त्यनामयम् || 51||
karma-jaṁ buddhi-yuktā hi phalaṁ tyaktvā manīṣhiṇaḥ
janma-bandha-vinirmuktāḥ padaṁ gachchhanty-anāmayam

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The people who have their intellect fixed [on the Self], having cast off the fruits from karma, become wise, and they attain, for certain, the disease-free state, emancipated from birth and death – meaning: the state free of the illness of samsara.

### Commentary 
 --- 
If one is with one-pointed intellect in buddhiyoga [the intellect fixed on the Self] and holds on to the bindu, rulership over the mind is born. The mind becomes according to how one would like it to be. That is, verily, the state of the wise. Then as mind stays in Mind, the fruits of karma have no place to exist; they automatically get destroyed. The Prakritic covering being torn off (one no longer has to “float around” in any other kind of veiling – meaning: one does not have to take birth), one attains the state that is free of the disease of birth and death, the Peace-filled state of Vishnu. This is absolutely and totally for certain.
