### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Those who keep their intellect in that sun-like Knowledge, who keep their chittas in that, those who are fully established in that, and those for whom that is the ultimate way – because their evils have been completely washed clean by that Knowledge, they attain the destination of no return. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
[Those who do sadhana in the previously mentioned ways – what their final attainment is – that is what is being spoken about in this sloka.] During the practice of sadhana, the state that is there after asampragyata samadhi breaks – that is verily the state of being “jivanmukta” [Liberated while still living in the body] (enveloped in Awareness). At that time not a bit of “kashmal” [see Chapter 2, sloka 2] remains. At that time, everything is Knowledge/Awareness or Brahman. The intellect is Brahman; the chitta is Brahman; settledness is Brahman; going is Brahman. Thus, the sadhak is “jivanmukta.” For this reason, as soon as the body is discarded [as soon as physical death happens], one attains “videhamukti” [Emancipation after death], or the destination of no return.
