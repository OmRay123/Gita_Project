### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Lord! Seeing Your many horrifying, teeth-filled mouths flaming with the fire of final destruction, I have lost sense of any of the directions. I cannot find comfort. Be appeased, O Home of the universe. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
O Lord! It is as if the light from the horrifying teeth in Your terrifying mouth is like the creation-destroying lightning of the time of dissolution. I am seeing them like flames of fire taking over all directions. I have lost sense of all directions. And I cannot feel any comfort at all. O Home of all creation, be appeased.
