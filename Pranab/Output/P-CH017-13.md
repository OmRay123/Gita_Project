The yajna that is devoid of directives stated in the scriptures, done without offering food to brahmins, without mantras, without giving honorarium and without faith/reverence is called “tamasic yajna.” 

### Commentary 
 --- 
The yajna with which there are no arrangements made for a satisfying feast, where no oblations with mantras are made etc., where there is no arrangement made for any honorarium, where only fireworks are shot off and a big noise is made by gathering people – these kinds of works are called “tamasic yajna.”
