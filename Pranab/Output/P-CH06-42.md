### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Or, the fallen yogi takes birth in the lineage of adept yogis. The kind of birth this is – this is indeed that which is rare in this world.

### Commentary 
 --- 
The second type of fallen yogi is of a higher level. That being takes birth in the household of seriously practicing yogis. This type of birth is very rare in this world. It is very fortunate. When one gets this kind of birth, the soul gets the kind of power of someone who is realized from birth. Thus, because of the practices being part of the lineage's ways, that yogi finds the door to Divine Realization appearing to him/her without any effort. (See sloka 44 [of this Chapter 6]).
