### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Krishna! If the evil ways which are opposite to dharma are taken, then the women of the lineages will become corrupted. O “Varshneya” [Sri Krishna]! If the qualities of women become evil, then the “varnas” [castes] become corrupted.

### Commentary 
 --- 
If this kind of unrighteousness – meaning: contrarian way – is present, then the women of the lineages will become corrupted. That from which there is offspring is called “stree” [woman]. All of the internal and external operators/senses [in the body], by having intercourse with consciousness, bring forth many vrittis such as pleasure, pain, desire, detachment, attachment, repulsion etc. Thus, this body and the senses are all “women.” All of these women will become corrupted – meaning: the body will be full of troubles. And being full of troubles, there will be corruption in the “varna[s]” [castes; alternate meaning: form[s]] – meaning: the beauty and radiance of the body will be ruined, and the functioning powers of the bodily instruments will also change; they will not remain in their original condition.
