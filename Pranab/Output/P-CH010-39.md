यच्चापि सर्वभूतानां बीजं तदहमर्जुन |
न तदस्ति विना यत्स्यान्मया भूतं चराचरम् || 39||
yach chāpi sarva-bhūtānāṁ bījaṁ tad aham arjuna
na tad asti vinā yat syān mayā bhūtaṁ charācharam

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Arjuna! The seed (cause of emergence) in all phenomena/living beings – I am that, as there is no phenomena – whether moving or unmoving – that can exist without Me.

### Commentary 
 --- 
O sadhak! Whatever you see in this static and dynamic universe – all of that is happening from “I”. All is “I”. You will not be able to see anything at all called “you” without “I”. There is no separate existence of anything apart from “I”.
