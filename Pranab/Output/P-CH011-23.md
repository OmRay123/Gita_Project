### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O “Mahabahu” [Mighty-armed One; Sri Krishna]! Seeing Your terrifying Form with many mouths, many eyes, many arms, many thighs and many feet, many bellies and many teeth, all beings are stricken with terror, as too am I. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
O “Mahabahu” [Mighty-armed One; Sri Krishna]! (One for Whom everything with a beginning, end and middle is under complete control in His hands – He is the One Who is called “Mahabahu.”) “Roopam mahatte” [huge form] – this Enormous Form of Yours is even beyond Mahat [the place/source from which the apparent world comes]. You have no Form. This is because You are without beginning; You are without end. Form exists with beginning and with end. But You have even taken Mahat into Your abyss, and are existing as One Form in such a Way – there are no words in language for that; it cannot be said with speech. Still, that Form that is appearing in that Mahat of Yours – in that, there are innumerable mouths, eyes, arms/hands; innumerable thighs, feet/legs, bellies; innumerable horrifying teeth. Seeing that, all of the worlds of beings are terrified and filled with anxiety; I too am terrified. (Dear sadhak! Relate this to that feeling of yours at that time; and go on connecting it.)
