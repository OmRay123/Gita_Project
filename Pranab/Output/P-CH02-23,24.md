### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
None of the weapons can cut this Self; fire cannot burn it; water cannot wet It; even air cannot dry It. It is uncuttable; It is nonflammable, non-wettable, and cannot be dried. It is Eternal, All-pervading, Stable (Still in Its nature), Unmoving (always the Same) and Primeval (without beginning). 

### Commentary 
 --- 
All of the phenomena that have come forth from the mutations of Maya cannot exercise any power on/over the Immutable. Weapons of all kinds, fire, water, air – all of these are Prakriti, as well as the distortions of Prakriti and its mutations. Therefore, the Self cannot be cut by weapons, burned by fire, wetted by water, or dried by air. For this reason the Self is uncuttable, nonflammable, non-wettable, and cannot be dried. It is Eternal, All-pervading, unshakeable and immovable like a tree cut to its stump, and is without beginning.
