### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The devoted person who sees enemies and friends, as well as respect and shame, as the same, who fully knows that cold, heat, pleasure and pain are the same, is without attachment, has the perception that blame and praise are the same, is silent, is content with whatever is there, is “aniket” (without an abiding place), and is steady-minded – [that one] is indeed dear to Me. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
“Sanga” [association] means [in this case] “desire” [because desire is attached to a person]. If this desire does not find a place in the inner being, then – enemy (the adversary), friend (the supporter, or similar in activity), respect (reverence), disrespect (derision), cold (the experience of coldness), heat (the experience of hotness), pleasure (with which the inner person is satisfied), pain/sorrow (opposite to that [pleasure]), derision (malevolent responses), praise (lauding) – one after another, the deadliness of these adversarial functionalities is destroyed. Then – “mauni” [silent] (controlled speech), being content with whatever is there, “aniket” (being without any particular abiding place because of being in Brahman), “sthiramati” [steady-mindedness] (one whose personal consciousness has turned towards Brahman and has thus become still) – these states come forth. Among human beings, the one who is endowed with these states – that one is indeed dear to Me – meaning: that one has attained the Self Itself.
