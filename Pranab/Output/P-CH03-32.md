ये त्वेतदभ्यसूयन्तो नानुतिष्ठन्ति मे मतम् |
सर्वज्ञानविमूढांस्तान्विद्धि नष्टानचेतस: || 32||
ye tvetad abhyasūyanto nānutiṣhṭhanti me matam
sarva-jñāna-vimūḍhāns tān viddhi naṣhṭān achetasaḥ

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
But those who, being “asuyayukta” [spiteful], do not practice this teaching of Mine – know those ones to be without discrimination, ignorant of all knowledge and ruined (bound for destruction).

### Commentary 
 --- 
Those who are not [the following:] reverent, free of spite and regular practitioners – qualities mentioned in the previous sloka [3:32] – meaning: those who do not practice Kriya according to instructions daily, those who find fault in others' qualities, praise themselves, and do not have any enthusiasm to practice guru's teachings – they are “achetasah” [unconscious; ignorant] – devoid of discrimination – meaning: they cannot have the knowledge of all things. Thus – far be it to talk about Liberation – they are “sarvagyanavimooDhah” [ignorant of all knowledge] – meaning: sound, touch, sight, taste, smell – they, being completely ignorant of the knowledge of all of these things (completely without Self-knowledge [alternate translation: lost in unconsciousness]), are ruined – meaning: falling in the cycles of samsara, they go round and round like unconscious beings. Know this. (Therefore: dear sadhak! Please engage yourself in the practice of the Kriya of the Self with full alertness and care.)
