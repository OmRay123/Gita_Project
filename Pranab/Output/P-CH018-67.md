### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Do not speak about the matters of the meanings of this Gita to those who do not practice austerities. Never speak of it to non-devotees. Also, do not speak of this to persons who do not want to listen. And, as well, do not speak of this to anyone who speaks maliciously of Me.

### Commentary 
 --- 
The one in whom there is none of: the austerities of the body stated in Chapter 17, sloka 14 [of the Bhagavad Gita]; the austerities of speech stated in sloka 15 [of the same chapter]; and the austerities of mind stated in sloka 16 [of the same chapter] – meaning: anyone who has contempt towards these – that is the one who is called “atapaska” [one who does not practice austerities]. The one who does not have faith in guru’s words or in God – that is the one who is called “abhakta” [non-devotee]. One who is uninterested in the practice of worship, the practice of service, the practice of listening [to spiritual wisdom] [and such] is called “ashrushu” [non-listener], and the one who hates “mam” – meaning: “I” – (by having attachment to anything and saying “mine” regarding such things is hating “I”) – that one is indignant towards Me.  These matters of the meaning of the Gita that I have told you – do not speak of this to these persons. It is not to be spoken [to them].
