### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Partha [Arjuna]! Being enveloped by tamas [guna], that which makes one think that non-dharma is dharma, and where every meaning (the thing to be known) is taken as its opposite – that is verily tamasic intellect.

### Commentary 
 --- 
O Partha [Arjuna; the sadhak]! The intellect that makes one think that dharma is non-dharma, non-dharma is dharma, and what to say – all the things that are to be known are known as their opposites – this ignorance-covered intellect is called tamasic intellect.
