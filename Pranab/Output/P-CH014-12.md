### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Bharatarshabha [Arjuna]! “Lobha” [greed], “pravritti” [effort to attain/have], “arambha” [commencement/undertaking] of all actions [also called “karmarambha”], “ashama” [disquiet; lack of serenity], and “spriha” [wishfulness] – these signs are born when rajoguna spreads. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
Even when there is great wealth and such, the lust that goes on growing to have even more – that is called “lobha” [greed]. The desire to enjoy the worldly experience is called “pravritti” [effort to attain/have]. To begin the endeavor to fulfill desires is called “karmarambha” [commencement of actions to gain]. “I will do this; I will do that” – the distress that is experienced with this way of the mind not being satisfied with anything at all – that is that which is called “ashama” [disquiet; lack of serenity]. Desiring immediately upon seeing things is called “spriha” [wishfulness; immediate desire]. When all of these active functionalities arise in the mind – one must know at that time that rajoguna has spread.
