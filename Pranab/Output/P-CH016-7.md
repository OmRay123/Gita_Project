प्रवृत्तिं च निवृत्तिं च जना न विदुरासुरा: |
न शौचं नापि चाचारो न सत्यं तेषु विद्यते || 7||
pravṛittiṁ cha nivṛittiṁ cha janā na vidur āsurāḥ
na śhauchaṁ nāpi chāchāro na satyaṁ teṣhu vidyate

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Persons who are endowed with the natures of the asuras do not know pravritti [endeavors] or nivritti [repose]. (Thus) they do not have purity, nor good behavior, not even truth.

### Commentary 
 --- 
The steadfastness of sadhana [spiritual practice] that is needed in order to attain the State of the Supreme Person or to regain Brahman-ness – that is that which is called “pravritti” [spiritual endeavor] (“pra” = all-ness + “vritti” [movement]). And the everlasting repose that there is after attaining Brahman-ness – that is verily “nivritti” [repose]. Where even the cause of “vrittis” [movements; functionalities; tendencies] cannot rise – that is verily the state of “nivritti” [“non-vritti”]. Both of these are lacking in the inner selves of those who are beings with asuric endowments. What pravritti and nivritti are – they do not even know that. “Shaucha” [purity] – see the commentary to Chapter 10, sloka 8 [of the Pranab Gita]. “Achaar” [good behavior] – doing bathing, ablutions and such. “Upaneeya guruh shiShyaṃ shikshayet shauchamAditah; AchAramagnikaryaṃcha sandhyopAsanameva cha” [having performed the rite of initiation, the teacher must first instruct the pupil to have purity and such, and the conducting of the fire-rites and of the twilight devotions]. “Satya” [truth] – beneficence of others. In the inner selves of the asuras – “shaucha,” “achaar,” “satya” – none of these three are there.
