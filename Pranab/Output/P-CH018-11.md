न हि देहभृता शक्यं त्यक्तुं कर्माण्यशेषत: |
यस्तु कर्मफलत्यागी स त्यागीत्यभिधीयते || 11||
na hi deha-bhṛitā śhakyaṁ tyaktuṁ karmāṇy aśheṣhataḥ
yas tu karma-phala-tyāgī sa tyāgīty abhidhīyate

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Persons with body-vanity are not able to fully relinquish all actions. (Thus) the one who relinquishes the fruits of actions – that is the one who is known as “tyagi.”

### Commentary 
 --- 
Those who are sitting there thinking that the body is “I”, who do not maintain the right to move vayu [vital-force] in the path of Brahman, who just go about doing things with the worldly experience outside – these types of ignorant ones are called “dehabhrit” [servants of the body]. These beings dress up as “I am the doer,” and thus, not being able to renounce karma [the fruits of actions], they are choked in the bindings of karma. And those who are discriminating – only they – because they perform karma [actions] while renouncing the fruits of karma – acquire the name of “tyagi” (Chapter 2, sloka 21).
