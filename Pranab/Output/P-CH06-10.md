The yogi should renounce craving and grasping, and, disciplining body and mind, should sit alone in a place of solitude and always keep the mind still.

### Commentary 
 --- 
The ultimate state of yoga is the state of yogarudha. In order to attain that, the yogi must select a secret place that is solitary and without disturbance, keep no one in his/her company and sit there alone, and discipline the body and mind. Expectations (cravings) must be removed from the mind. And one has to become a renunciate of everything – meaning: whatever rises up in the antahkarana and whenever it happens, that has to be immediately cast away. Being vigilant in this way, the mind has to be made still. Just as in the external world a solitary, secret place is called “rahas” [hidden; secret], in the same way, the inner part of the sushumna within is “rahas.” Going there, the mind becomes devoid of external attention. At that time, the external worldly experience cannot touch the mind. Disciplining the body – this happens if one simply sits in asana [seated yoga posture] as taught by guru. And disciplining the mind – this happens simply by keeping the attention still according to guru's teachings.
