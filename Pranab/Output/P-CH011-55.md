### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Pandava [Arjuna]. The one who performs acts dedicated to Me, the one to whom verily I am the Supreme Divine Goal, the one who is My devotee, who has abandoned all attachment, and is devoid of enmity towards any beings – that being is the one who attains Me. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
[The kinds of character and behavior that bring about the attainment of “I” – that bring about Liberation – for the God-longing aspirants – the Lord is bestowing that very teaching in a condensed way in the Gita, the essence of all scriptures.] Therefore, O Arjuna! The one who drives prana in the path/way shown through guru’s teachings, the one who puts oneself into that “I”, the one who keeps that “I” in front of oneself and tries to merge with that “I”, the one who has absolutely no other desire at all, the one for whom there is no conflict with any beings/phenomena because of the guna-attached beings/phenomena being unable to bring forth any troubles to that one – that being is the one who attains this “I” – becomes “I”.
