### Commentary 
 --- 
[It is not so that one becomes a muni [realized being] just by doing Kriya according to the previous sloka. Knowledge is necessary. If there is no knowledge, then the result of that [previously mentioned] pranayam will be the magic kumbhak [breath-retention] of magic-show-people. That is why He [Sri Krishna] is speaking about that knowledge in this sloka.] When, upon being in samadhi, the yogi sees and understands that all of the yagyas [sacrificial fire ceremonies] and austerities that are performed – that (Narayana) Vishnu is verily the enjoyer of those, all of the mantras such as “bhur bhuvah” etc. that people offer when one becomes established in the rites – [the yogi sees that] the Lord Vishnu Himself is the actual director of all of those [acts]. And it is That Vishnu Himself Who is presiding within every living being (within the heart) in the form of the Self, and the “I” is the All-pervading Vishnu. It is then that the sadhak becomes all-pervading and merges into Vishnu. The sadhak attains Peace, Liberation.
