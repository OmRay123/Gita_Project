### Prose 
 --- 
गुरूनहत्वा हि महानुभावान्
श्रेयो भोक्तुं भैक्ष्यमपीह लोके |
हत्वार्थकामांस्तु गुरूनिहैव
भुञ्जीय भोगान् रुधिरप्रदिग्धान् || 5||
gurūnahatvā hi mahānubhāvān
śhreyo bhoktuṁ bhaikṣhyamapīha loke
hatvārtha-kāmāṁstu gurūnihaiva
bhuñjīya bhogān rudhira-pradigdhān

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
If I have to eat by begging because I am refraining from killing all of these noble venerable ones – even that [begging to eat] is better for me. But, if we kill these persons [from the side of Dhritarashtra], then we will have to experience, right here in this world, the consequences of the blood-killing of relatives.

### Commentary 
 --- 
So, if because of not destroying these two powerful ones [“I-ness” and samskaric intellect], I have to experience lack (“bhaikshya” [beggar-condition]) in this world because of the karma from this desire [to not kill them] – meaning: remaining under the rulership of Prakriti – even that is good. But destroying these two and gaining rulership over Prakriti is not good. This is because if the “I-ness” does not remain, then the sensory experience does not remain, and if the Prakritic intellect does not remain, then good and bad do not remain. In that condition, [desiring] worldly enjoyments, or living in the body, is nothing but being ridiculous. It is like when there is an illness on the tongue that makes one not be able to taste, and because of that, the pleasurable food becomes full of unpleasantness/painful – it is like that. “Gurun” [see third line of the sloka above] [in the spiritual case] is the pluralized form of “gaurav” [pride].
