### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
As you contemplate on Me, from my Blessings, you will pass over all obstacles (all of the impassable sufferings of samsara). And if you, [put yourself] under the power of egotism and do not listen (to My words), then you will perish.

### Commentary 
 --- 
It is when personal consciousness comes into “I” that one gets My Blessings. The chitta [personal consciousness] enjoying My Blessings is that which is called “macchitta” [mind on Me; or: mind in My Consciousness]. In this state, you will pass over “sarvadurga” [all phenomenal obstacles] – meaning: the shadow that had come over the impure personal consciousness when it is facing creation – because of personal consciousness now being pure, that barrier made by that shadow will be cut apart. Thus, the errors of contact from the seed of samsara will end. You will become Free. You will go beyond Maya. And if you take recourse in egotism, and do not listen to this teaching, if you do not take it [this teaching] in, then you will die – meaning: you will go on experiencing birth and death.
