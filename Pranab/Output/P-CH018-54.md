The cheerful-minded person residing in Brahman does not grieve (over lost/destroyed things), does not hanker (after non-procurable things), and, being the same in all things/situations, attains the supreme devotion to Me. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
The one who has experienced the happiness from the contact with Brahman in samadhi-oneness in the earlier previously-mentioned way – that person is called “brahmavid” [knower of Brahman] or “brahmabhoot” [residing in Brahman]. “Prasannatma” = “pra” = in every way; “sanna” = going – the one who is moving about in the Self in every way – meaning: at the time of abiding in the Self, the one in whom no kind of Mayic impressions spring up – that is the one who is called “prasannatma.” No grief [comes] to the antahkarana of these sadhaks [spiritual practitioners] who are in this state – meaning: the operative power of chitta [personal consciousness] is not active, and [no] hankering – meaning: other than Brahman, no lust to get any Mayic things remains. Because of being in waveless settledness, no shockwave arises. Thus, [at this time,] not having the perception of whether all phenomena exist or not, and as One remains present, the fruit attained through having unmoving faith in guru’s words – that “I Am Brahman” – that being attains that very thing (Chapter 6, sloka 32; Chapter 7, sloka 16).
