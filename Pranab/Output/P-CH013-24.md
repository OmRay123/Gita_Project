### Prose 
 --- 
य एवं वेत्ति पुरुषं प्रकृतिं च गुणै: सह |
सर्वथा वर्तमानोऽपि न स भूयोऽभिजायते || 24||
ya evaṁ vetti puruṣhaṁ prakṛitiṁ cha guṇaiḥ saha
sarvathā vartamāno ’pi na sa bhūyo ’bhijāyate

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The one who knows Purush to be like this, and [the one who knows] that Prakriti is with attributes – that one, even while being present in every kind of activity, does not again take birth.

### Commentary 
 --- 
The one who clearly knows oneself (one’s own Self – meaning; [the one who knows] the One Who is Pure, Self-luminous, Ruler, Formless – that One) in the aforementioned perspective, and clearly knows Prakriti and Prakriti’s qualities, operations and powers (it will not do to just know in some cursory way; whenever whatever vritti [tendency] arises, even without trying, one will automatically free one’s Purush state from the contact with Prakriti and easily laugh at it, just from the fruits of practice – when it will be like this, only then) – that person’s divisions of time, such as past and future, which have arisen due to the errors of Prakriti, will be destroyed, and a state where one is endlessly in the present at all times will come about. In this state, no rules or restrictions – none of that will be there. The reason is: because of that person having become “all is Brahman,” no functionalities that are seeds of rebirth will at all arise. That being will become “jivanmukta” [Liberated while living in the body]. Thus, no matter in which way he/she is on the outside, because of the absence of birth-causing impressions, that being will never have rebirth again.
