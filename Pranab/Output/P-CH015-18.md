यस्मात्क्षरमतीतोऽहमक्षरादपि चोत्तम: |
अतोऽस्मि लोके वेदे च प्रथित: पुरुषोत्तम: || 18||
yasmāt kṣharam atīto ’ham akṣharād api chottamaḥ
ato ’smi loke vede cha prathitaḥ puruṣhottamaḥ

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Because I am beyond “kshara” and am even superior to “Akshara” – for this reason, I am renowned as “Purushottama” [Ultimate Person; Supreme Person] to people and the Vedas. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
As I am beyond the Maya-filled phenomena/beings and the “kshara purush” in the form of the “ashvattha” tree (samsara), and as I put “Akshara Kutastha,” the source of the seeds of samasara, below Me as well, and as I stay high up above – that is why in the world of people and the Vedas, because I reside above the two purushes, I am renowned as “Purushottama” [Ultimate Person; Supreme Person].
