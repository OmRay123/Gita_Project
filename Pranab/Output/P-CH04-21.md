### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Being without desire, self-controlled, and having renounced all – that sadhak only performs the karmas [actions] that are being carried out in the body, and does not become bound to sin.

### Commentary 
 --- 
When there is no “kama” or “sankalpa” [see commentary to sloka 4:19] in the mind, the kinds of activities that go on happening automatically in the body at that time – that is verily “shAreeraṃ kevalaṃ karma” [only the actions in the body; see second line of the sloka above]. In “kevala karma” [spontaneous activities], there is only the spontaneous carrying on of the body. There is no goal attached to it. When the mind is free of desire and has renounced all, no vanity of doership remains. Thus, even while making efforts for the body and such, one does not have to fall to sin (restlessness) – meaning: one does not have to fall to the bondage of samsara. Dear sadhak! Recall the bit of time that is just before the merging of all things in the paravastha of the paravastha of your Kriya.
