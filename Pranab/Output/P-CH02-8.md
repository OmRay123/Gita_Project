### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Even if I get uncontested rulership over all of the kingdoms of the world, or even over the gods, I still do not see anything that will remove this grief that is desiccating my senses.

### Commentary 
 --- 
“Bhoomi” = field – [meaning:] this body; “asapatna” = without enemies; the “daivic” opposition [opposition arising from the subtle body], vrittis of “asat” [unholiness; unrighteousness] and the aberrations of natural ways – these three are the “enemies.” Whatever goes on to be known through the practice of asana, pranayam and such – only that much becomes “rulership of a kingdom without enemies.” At that time, the yoga-siddhis [yogic powers] that are attained through particular Kriyas, that is what is called “riddhi” or “vibhuti” [wondrous/miraculous things/powers]. It is when one becomes “dressed with 'vibhuti'” through perfection in yoga that the body becomes a kingdom without enemies and a place of wonders.
 
“Sura” [demi-god; or: melody] (“sa” + “u” + “ra”): “sa” = divinity - “prANohi bhagaVaneeshah” [prana is the divine power] – therefore it is prana; “u” = the settling in Sahasrar; “ra” = power/light. The blaze of Energy/Light that is revealed when prana becomes Still at the Sahasrar – that is “sura.” The Power that comes about when mind is merged into the “Naad-bindu” [the bindu of Sound] in the front and back of that Light – that is what is called “surANAṃ Adhipatyaṃ” [rulership over the gods].
 
The sadhak is at this time absorbed in ignorance. That is why he/she is not able to see that if that kind of [aforementioned] attainment in yoga is had, then there is nothing left for which one would grieve. [The sadhak] is despairing because of thinking of things [from an ignorant state of being].
