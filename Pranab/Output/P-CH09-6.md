### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
As the powerful air is everywhere in space and always there, like that, all living beings/phenomena exist within Me.

### Commentary 
 --- 
It is like this: the sky is limitless, and even though air is limited, in its own subtle aspects it has dressed itself up as if it is the limitless. Even though this is happening [air being throughout the sky], this does not make any impression on the sky. In the same way, all living beings/phenomena have dressed themselves up in their subtlest aspects with “Me” and are showing themselves as “I”. But “I Am” not connected to anything of the living beings/phenomena. That is why I [Sri Krishna] am saying, “Know this. Like air is in the sky, so are the living beings/phenomena within “Me.”
