### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Even though these [persons on the side of Dhritarashtra] are killers, if we kill them we will incur sin. Therefore, it is not right for us to kill our friends such as Duryodhana and others. O Madhav! What kind of happiness will we gain by killing our own?

### Commentary 
 --- 
“MAdhav[a]”: “mA” = “[Goddess] Lakshmi”; “dhav[a]” = husband. The sadhak is thinking: “The One Who is the Ruler of the three worlds – He is “Madhav.” And it is He Who is the Teacher of Yoga as well. So both bhoga and yoga are present in Him. Then it is best to be like Him.” So, [the sadhak] is thinking in his mind: “Yes, of course it is true that because all of these [hindering] vrittis are in me – that is why I am finding obstacles in the path of sadhana. But does my dharma remain in tact after destroying all of these [hindering vrittis]? I cannot exist even for a moment without the help of the samsaric senses manifesting as and in the form of the body. If stopping the works of the senses is 'yoga,' then what shall I call 'sin'? If the works of the senses are stopped, then there will be troubles in the body (personal afflictions). That cannot ever be 'dharma' [spirituality/righteousness]. Killing my own will only beget sin. How can it be that I would get happiness [from that]? Therefore, O guru, if there is a way of yoga where all of this [bhoga] can be preserved [as well], then tell me [about that]. If not, I cannot be involved in carrying out these sinful activities.”
