### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Even if the yoga-united person, being purified in chitta, victorious over the body, victorious over the senses and seeing the same in all performs karma [actions], he/she does not become bound (by that).

### Commentary 
 --- 
The yoga-united sadhak – having followed the methods of the previous slokas and having attained Settledness in Brahman, and then coming down and again becoming yoga-united – becomes a being with a pure chitta – meaning: remains in the Pure “I” state. Because all of his karmas [actions and their fruits] are burned to ashes in the fire of gyana, he/she becomes victorious over the body (see Chapter 4, sloka 37 [of the Gita]). By following [the teaching] in sloka 39 of Chapter 4 [of the Gita], when all senses become completely controlled [or: one], that sadhak becomes victorious over the senses – meaning: even when coming into contact with the worldly experience, none of the sadhak's senses become attached to the worldly experience. And knowing all phenomena/beings including iconic pillars such as Brahmaa [creator aspect of the Hindu Trinity] within one's Self, that sadhak becomes all-seeing. For this reason, even if karma [actions] are performed due to the connection with prarabdha [karma to carry out the body], one does not become bound by that. When the chitta is purified by the Light of Consciousness, no imprint by worldly experiences is made ever again in the chitta.
