### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
When one receives “prasad” [blessings], all of one's sufferings end. The blessed and happy-hearted person's intellect, indeed very quickly, becomes still.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Earth, water, fire, air, ether – these five are known as “all.” This “all” covers up the inner sky in the form of “kashmal” [confused sights; see sloka 2 of this Chapter 2]. That is what is called “duhkha” [suffering; sorrow; pain]. When “prasad” is received – meaning: when the Effulgent Form appears, Its radiance dispels all darkness; not even any sign of impurities remain. Thus, the heart becomes blessed and happy – meaning: because it is pure, it becomes free of restlessness and becomes still. As soon as the heart is still, the thinking power finds no place in which to be, and because of this it extinguishes. — Begin Footnote. — This, verily, is “nirvana sthiti” [establishment in Nirvana] (“anmanaska-sthiti [establishment in no-mind]. The “brahmi sthiti” [establishment in Brahman; also written as one compound word “brahmisthiti”] stated in sloka 72 [of this Chapter 2] is there even in the waking state, and “Brahman-Nirvana” happens after the casting off of the body [death] – that which is called “videha mukti” [Liberation without the body/after the body is left behind]. — End Footnote. — “Chalachitte vaseshaktih sthirachitte vaseshivah” - iti Jnana Saṃkalaneetantram [in the moving mind/heart sits Shakti; in the still mind/heart sits Shiva – so says the Jnana Sankalanee Tantra [a scripture].
