### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
One has to practice yoga by completely abandoning all desires of volition, and by taking, via the mind itself, all of the senses out of the worldly experience.

### Commentary 
 --- 
The kinds of regulations by which one should practice yoga – that is being spoken about in this sloka. Sitting in the yogic posture in the appropriate way, one has to totally abandon all thoughts of the worldly experience and any thought whatsoever of attainment, and then fix the mind in Kutastha. If this is done, the senses automatically become regulated. This is because the senses follow the mind. Thus, whatever of the worldly experiences that the mind goes to – the senses immediately become activated to enjoy those particular worldly experiences. But if the mind abandons the worldly experiences and becomes absorbed in “avishaya” [non-worldly thing/experience] – meaning: the Self-Truth – then, all of the senses, not being able to find recourse in the worldly experience as a whole, withdraw from the entirety of the worldly experience and become inactive. Controlling the senses via the mind mentally is the only way to control the senses. There is no other way; [if one takes up some other way] one takes up falsehood.
