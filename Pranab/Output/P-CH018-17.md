### Prose 
 --- 
यस्य नाहङ् कृतो भावो बुद्धिर्यस्य न लिप्यते |
हत्वाऽपि स इमाँल्लोकान्न हन्ति न निबध्यते || 17||
yasya nāhankṛito bhāvo buddhir yasya na lipyate
hatvā ‘pi sa imāl lokān na hanti na nibadhyate

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The one who does not have egotistical ways, the one whose intellect is not wrapped up [in samsara] – that one, even if he/she kills all of these people [or: kills in all of these planes], actually does not kill, and is not bound (by the fruits of such actions).

### Commentary 
 --- 
The one for whom, through the practice of Kriya, the State of “I” has become firm, the one whose intellect finds no space or time to think of him/herself as “doer,” the one who remains in the Self unbrokenly as the Self, who does not become wrapped up in anything with beginning, end and middle – if spontaneous killing happens in this world of people [or: in these planes-worlds] just by the moving of his body (like: I am laying there; a bedbug is biting; I turned to the side; in the sleepy state of turning the bedbug died), that person is not the doer of such killing, nor does that person become bound by the karmic fruits born of killing. (See Chapter 2, slokas 17 through 21.)
