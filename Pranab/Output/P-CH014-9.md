### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Bharat [Arjuna]! Sattva guna enjoins one to pleasure and rajoguna enjoins one to action, and tamoguna [tamas guna] covers up intelligence/knowledge and enjoins one to madness.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Sattva guna is revelatory; it stays in one place and illuminates/reveals all. Those whom it illuminates – they are forced to succumb to the power of the illuminator/revealer. Thus, the lordship [of sattva] comes about automatically. This type of experiencing of such states is called Prakritic happiness. Sattva guna brings one to this [type of] happiness. Rajoguna is active. It wishes to work. It does not remain in one place. The active aspect of this guna is only restlessness. It enjoins one to action. And tamoguna [tamas guna] is ignorance. The consciousness brought about by action and the illuminator/revealer – [tamoguna] drains that away [or: covers that up], and causes opposition to right action. That which causes harm – it enjoins one verily to that, like putting liquor into a healthy body and staying unconscious [in a stupor] – this type of action. This is that which is called “pramaad” [madness]. O Bharat [Arjuna]! The Stillness of Only-ness that is of “pure tamas” – that does not exist in this Prakritic tamas.
