### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Faith/reverence is according to the [particular] natures of the embodied ones. They are sattvic, rajasic and tamasic – these three types.

### Commentary 
 --- 
[The sadhak] is determining the answer through his/her own knowingness. The good and bad impressions that arise, which have been carried over from other births – that is called “their natures.” In those natures, there are three gunas [essential qualities] – sattva, rajas, and tamas [these have various spellings according to grammatical context]. The quality with which one is born – his/her faith manifests according to that guna. How the three types of faith regarding those three gunas are – now hear of that very subject.
