### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
In Sankhya scripture – knowledge, act and doer – each are stated as being divided into the three types of gunas [primal qualities] such as sattva etc. I am elucidating (speaking) about those. Listen. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
That by which all of the gunas can be completely known – that is indeed the accounting of the gunas [or: analysis of the gunas] – meaning: the Sankhya scripture. Knowledge, act and doer – the forms in which these three have been illustrated in that Sankhya scripture, according to the gunas sattva, rajas and tamas [influencing] knowledge, act and doer – that is what I  am telling you about, one by one. Listen.
