### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Partha [Arjuna]! O Arjuna! But the steadfastness via which (humans) hold onto [the ideals of] dharma [religion], “kama” [desires] and “artha” [wealth], and being attached to those, become desirous of the fruits of actions – that is rajasic steadfastness.

### Commentary 
 --- 
And when the operations of mind, energy and senses fall off the path of Liberation and become associated with dharma [religion], “artha” [wealth] and “kama” [desires], and thus become engrossed in the satisfying of the lusts of enjoyment – O Partha [Arjuna; the sadhak]! this steadfastness – this actually is that which is called rajasic steadfastness.
