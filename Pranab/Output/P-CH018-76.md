keśhavārjunayoḥ puṇyaṁ hṛiṣhyāmi cha muhur muhuḥ

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O King [Dhritarashtra]! As I again and again remember this “adbhoot” (sacred) [ordinary meaning: astonishing], sin-destroying dialogue between Keshava [Sri Krishna] and Arjuna, I rejoice over and over.

### Commentary 
 --- 
O King! Remembering this “punya-filled” [holy] (“pu” = “push” [nourishing], “nak” = Nirvana Emancipation, “yam” – itself/self – meaning: that which frees one from the perishing body and makes one attain the Self of oneself – that is that which is called “punya”) astonishing/sacred dialogue, I am experiencing bliss at every moment.

There is no end to this Bliss. That Enchanting Form of/in the paravastha [post-Kriya poise], knowing the relationship of the true forms of the jiva [individual soul], Ishvara [Lord] and Maya, the waves of that Enchanting Sound – which cannot be expressed in words – whenever I remember it [all of it], my body immediately thrills in that Bliss. The one who enjoys this delight will know.
