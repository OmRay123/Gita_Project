I want to see You in that Form, with crown, mace/club, discus in hand. O thousand-armed Cosmic Form! Appear in that four-armed Form. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
O thousand-armed Cosmic Form! Subdue this Cosmic Form of Yours. The form that You showed as Yourself at the time of Your [human] birth, wearing a crown on Your head, and holding conch-shell, discus, mace/club and lotus, the four-armed Form that cast away the fear of Devaki and Vasudev [short “a”; Sri Krishna’s father], the Form that gave them security – show me today that fear-destroying, Peaceful Form and reassure my heart. I greatly desire to see that Form of Yours.
