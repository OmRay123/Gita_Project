### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Just as, because of its subtleness, the space that is everywhere is not enwrapped (by anything) – in the same way, even though the Self exists throughout the body, It is not enwrapped. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
That the Supreme Self is not enwrapped even while existing in the body – this is exemplified by space. See – space is everywhere. There is no place or thing in which space is not. Fill this space with smoke; blow dust on it; spray mud on it; try in whichever you can to put impurities on space; you will see that no mark can be made on the body of space. As soon as smoke, dust etc. go away, the same space remains just as space. This is because space is subtle in substance; it does not blend with the gross/physical. Just as this space is not enwrapped by/with anything, yet everything is present within it – just like that, because the Self is subtler than the subtlest, even though it is everywhere, in whatever bodies there are in the cosmos, it is not enwrapped by any actions/operations by anyone/anything.
