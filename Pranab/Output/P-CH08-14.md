### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Partha [Arjuna]! One whose consciousness does not go to anything else, who is remembering Me at all times and without end – for that ever-united yogi, I am easy to attain.

### Commentary 
 --- 
The one for whom there is no distraction, even for a little bit, away from Consciousness/Spirit – only for that person is there the remembrance/meditation of “I”. As “I Am” Infinite, that person also becomes Infinite just like “I”. That is the one who is “yogi.” Such a wonder is this Eternal “I”; one becomes enjoined to this “I”, and then is forever in Union with this “I”. Dear sadhak! Now please understand this. Your “purvavastha” of Kriya [pre-Kriya state], “Kriyavastha” [during-Kriya state], “paravastha” of Kriya, [post-Kriya poise/state], and Kriya’s “paravastha of the paravastha” [post “paravastha” state] have been stated in this sloka.
