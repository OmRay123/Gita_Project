द्रोणं च भीष्मं च जयद्रथं च
कर्णं तथान्यानपि योधवीरान् |

karṇaṁ tathānyān api yodha-vīrān
mayā hatāṁs tvaṁ jahi mā vyathiṣhṭhā

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Kill Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Jayadratha and the other heroic warriors, all of whom have already been killed by Me. Do not be afraid. Fight. You will be able to conquer the enemies in war

### Commentary 
 --- 
“Bhishma” = ego born of ignorance; “Drona” = intellect born of samskaras [latent tendencies/impressions]; “Jayadratha” = anxiousness or the fear of death; “Karna” = attachment to obligatory work (see Chapter 1, slokas 8-9); and the other desire-associated warriors – they have already died because of having taken refuge in that false “I”. And Arjuna! You? You, abiding in the Real “I”, have already become victorious over the adversaries in war. Where is there any fear in this?
