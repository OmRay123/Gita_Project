### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
Bad, good and mixed – these three types of fruits happen for the non-tyagis [non-renunciates of the worldly experience] after the falling of the body [death]. But this does not happen for the sannyasis anywhere at all.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Good, bad, and good and bad mixed – these are the three types of fruits of actions. With good fruits – attainment of godliness happens; with bad fruits, there is the experience of hell; and with mixed fruits there is human-ness. Those who are non-tyagis – meaning: who have succumbed to desires – for them these fruits are “paratra” – meaning: they have to experience these in the afterlife [or: next life]. But those who are “sannyasis” – meaning: those who are renunciates of the fruits of actions – all of these fruits of actions cannot touch them. This is because: by following the statement “tat kuruShvamadarpaNam” [do that as an offering to Me], and thereby surrendering all of their actions to the Lord, they are free of the bindings of karma [actions and their fruits]. Any sins that may occur unknown to them because of just carrying the body and going about, those who vilify them [the sannyasis] – those reproachers take on those sins. And the good that the sannyasis do knowingly – those who praise them [the sannyasis] are the ones who get those beneficent fruits.
