### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
At the end-time [death], the one who leaves the body while continuously remembering Me – that being attains My State. There is no doubt about this.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Later, slokas 9-10 [of this Chapter 8] provide the answer to Arjuna’s 7th question [see commentary to slokas 8:1-2] – meaning: the way by which the Lord is known at the time of departure [death] – that has been said in those two slokas [8:9-10]. But that “way” is dependent upon practice. That is why the Lord, in slokas 5-8 [of this Chapter 8], after first speaking about the mental state at the time of death, addresses the method of practice [to attain that previously mentioned “way” at the time of death]. In the 5th sloka [of this Chapter 8], He says, “If one leaves the body at the end-time [death] while remembering Me, one attains My State.” He states the particular reason for this in sloka 6 [of this Chapter 8]. He says that it is so because: the state that one remembers at the time of leaving the body – one attains that very state [after leaving the body]. For this reason, in the 7th sloka [of this Chapter 8], He says to constantly do “mAmanusmaraN” [remember Me; a deeper definition is given in the commentaries to slokas 8:7 and 8:9-10 of the Pranab Gita] and fight (pranayam etc.). After that, in the 8th sloka [of this Chapter 8], He says, “When the chitta [personal consciousness] does not go to anything else [anything other than the Self] – it is then that the Supreme Person is attained.” After speaking on all of these matters as a kind of preamble, He then says, in slokas 9-10, in what way and how He is known at the time of departure [death]. All of this can be understood by simply reading the next slokas one after another. [The Lord says:] “Now, take a look and see – from that Akshara Brahman to this Adhiyajna [see commentary to slokas 8:3-4] – all of these things [see slokas 8:1-4] have refuge in Me. That is why I am “Vasudeva” [One in Whom everything resides and Who resides in everything]. (The One in Whom all things reside, the One Who is the Shelter of everything and everyone, the One Whose limbs and extensions are all of this creation and all of the living beings, yet the One Who is not a body nor is embodied – that is the One Who is “Vasudeva.”) Such is this “I” that, when one leaves the body while having known this “I” (meaning: not the presumed “I” that is this body made up of parts of a mother and a father – having this clear knowledge) – that person becomes “I” – meaning: that person attains the Self Itself. There is no need to have doubt about this. This teaching is absolute truth.”
