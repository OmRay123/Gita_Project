### Commentary 
 --- 
The one in whose inner being there is attachment, the hankering for the fruits of actions, greed for others’ possessions, miserliness when it comes to [contributing to] good works and pilgrimages and such, who inflicts harm on others in order to save him/herself, the one for whom there is a lack of the stillness of mind that is the inner cleanliness, who behaves ruthlessly outside, delights in the acquiring of enjoyments such as gold etc., grieves when something [that is desired] is not acquired – that one is called rajasic doer.
