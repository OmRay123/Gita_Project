### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The one who takes shelter in Me – the Being Who exists in all phenomena in Oneness (Undifferentiated) – that yogi, no matter whatever sort of condition in which he/she may be, is always present in Me alone.

### Commentary 
 --- 
The one who, having taken recourse in the brahmanadi within the sushumna, has become spiritually intoxicated via special Kriya, whose vision has become filled with Brahman – for that sadhak, all is One. That sadhak sees the Self as Undifferentiated in all phenomena. Therefore, because that sadhak perceives no difference in the worldly experience and Brahman, in whatever condition and wherever he/she may be, even though that sadhak partakes in the worldly experience like ordinary beings, that sadhak is a “yogi” - meaning: he/she is living in the yogic state. Therefore, that sadhak is “in Me” - meaning: in the Self, in the Supreme Substance, residing in Vishnu-Being. That sadhak is Eternally Free; nothing whatsoever can block him/her in the path of Liberation. Whether in the state of being in the body, or beyond/after the body, that being remains as “I” Itself.
