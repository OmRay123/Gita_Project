### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Arjuna! The karma [action] that is always done with the understanding that it is obligatory, and with the relinquishing of association and [the relinquishing of the desire for] results (the tyaga that happens with that) – that tyaga is called “sattvic [tyaga].”

### Commentary 
 --- 
Whatever is happening outside due to the habitual operations of the organs of the senses and the organs of action, and inside, the movement of prana is also going in an unattached way – this controlled action – in this, neither is there any attachment to the fruits of actions, nor is there any attachment to renouncing – no thinking of “I am renouncing.”
