### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The destroyers of lineage will completely lose the dharmas of the particular castes and the age-old righteousness/righteous works associated with lineages because of all of these sins of corrupting the castes.

### Commentary 
 --- 
As aberrations occur in the body because of harm coming to the “varna” [form; caste], the body becomes unable to function [properly]. Whatever the pure dharma of particular castes and lineages are – they disappear because they [the pure dharmas] cannot be carried out by that corrupted form of the body.
