### Commentary 
 --- 
O Bharata [Arjuna; the sadhak]! (“Bha” = engaged in radiance.) O awakened one! Whenever and however much you interact with those “sarva” [see commentary to sloka 18:61 of the Pranab Gita] – all of that is the divine-power Prakriti with gunas [primal qualities]. Discern Prakriti, the mutations of Prakriti and the works from the permutations of Prakriti; do not mix with them; and with a natural movement take recourse in the path of Brahman located in the heart-area, and go forward to merge with Kutastha Chaitanya Ishvara. When this practice of yours goes from deep to deepest, then – the Supreme Peace and Settledness in Brahman that is in the “shashvata” [eternal] (Imperishable) Substance – you will get that.

“Sharanaṃ gacchha” [go unto surrender] in this sloka [verse] and “yathecchhasi tathA kuru” [do as you please] in sloka 63 [of Chapter 18 of the Bhagavad Gita] – through these two statements, the Lord is quite clearly teaching that even though the jiva is an instrument of Prakriti, an instrument of one’s own nature, and an instrument of the Lord, he/she has free will regarding the matters of desire. That is why, through using the term “tameva” [unto Him verily], the Lord is having Arjuna look at “mam” [Me; I] in statements such as “mAmeva ye prapadyante mAyAm etAṃ taranti te” [surrendering unto Me, this Maya can certainly be crossed] and “mAmekAṃ sharanaṃ vraja” [go surrender unto Me alone], and then, through the words “gacchha” [go] and “kuru” [do], He is giving the teachings about taking up the necessary effort in spiritual practice via competent Kriya.
