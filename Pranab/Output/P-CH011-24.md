### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Vishnu! Upon seeing You as pervading within [all], illuminated, with many forms and with gaping mouth, and with fiery, gigantic eyes, I am fearful in my heart, and I cannot find steadiness or tranquility.

### Commentary 
 --- 
O Vishnu! (The One Who pervades all of the universe like ghee existing within milk – He is the One Who is called “Vishnu.”) It is as if You have taken Space into You, and there are many forms, beyond measure; that gaping mouth of Yours with blazing flames coming forth from it, and that intensely bright mass of light that is Your expansive Eye – seeing that, my inner being is trembling with fear. I am not able to be steady or properly keep my equipoise.
