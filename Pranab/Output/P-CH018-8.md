### Commentary 
 --- 
“There is no more profit in the trade. There is nothing but bickering.” That teaching of doing actions without the desire for results – according to that perception [in the first sentence of this commentary], there is nothing that has a beginning, end and middle to be had [by doing a spiritual act]. It is just sitting and “washing space.” By doing this [renunciation for wrong reasons], stiffness comes to the body; with time, it becomes bent and broken. Those who renounce those [previously mentioned] actions due to such imagined fears – they are bound to do other actions. But the fruit of that sacred renunciation – the Settledness in Brahman or the Knowledge of Brahman – that they do not get. Their renunciation is called “rajasic tyaga.”
