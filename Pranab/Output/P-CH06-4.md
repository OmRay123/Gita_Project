### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
When the human being is not attached to the worldly experiences of sound etc. and all karmas – that is when that being is said to be “renounced of all volitions and mounted on yoga.” 

### Commentary 
 --- 
Dear sadhak! While going on doing Kriya, when you see that your mind is not falling to the pull of the worldly experiences of sound and such, there is no more connection to prana-Kriya either, prana has become steady and still, and no scintilla of desire is coming up – it is then that you will know that you have become “yogarudha” [mounted on yoga]. At that time, the mind automatically takes up Sahasrar-Kriya; no sadhana other than that remains. And just a short while after that, the establishment in Brahman takes place. The time of experiencing that established state is the state of being “renounced of all volitions and mounted on yoga.”
