### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The doer who is without attachment, without egotism (self without pride), who has patience and enthusiasm, who is indifferent to accomplishment and failure as well as delight and disgust is called sattvic. 

### Commentary 
 --- 
The one for whom desires do not rise up during Kriya, for whom there is no sense of “me,” whose mind is bound to the path of Brahman, who progresses towards the Expanse of Brahman at every step, the one for whom there is no contact in the inner being with the ideas of accomplishment and failure – the sadhak [spiritual practitioner] who is in this kind of state is called a sattvic doer. (For as long as the antahkarana [inner operators of personal consciousness] is bound to the great thirst – this type of [spiritual] poverty-stricken state is called “asiddhavastha” [the state of non-accomplishment]; and the state of the attainment of attainments is called “siddhavastha” [the state of accomplishment/attainment]. For as long as this sense of attainment is there, for that long is there “vikar” [mutating; changing]. When there is Stillness in the Self, that cannot be called “vikar.”)
