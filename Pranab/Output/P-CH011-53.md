नाहं वेदैर्न तपसा न दानेन न चेज्यया |
शक्य एवंविधो द्रष्टुं दृष्टवानसि मां यथा || 53||
nāhaṁ vedair na tapasā na dānena na chejyayā
śhakya evaṁ-vidho draṣhṭuṁ dṛiṣhṭavān asi māṁ yathā

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
The way that you have seen Me – not through the study of the aggregate of the Vedas, not by austerities, not by giving and not by ritual sacrifice are others able to see Me in this way.

### Commentary 
 --- 
This “I” – even if the recitation of Sama-Rik-YajurAtharva [Vedas] is mastered, that “I” is not seen. Doing austere practices like emaciating the body and such, holding oneself upside down and such also cannot bring about the witnessing of that “I”. The ritual sacrifices such oblations in fire and such also cannot bring about the witnessing of that “I”. Even if one gives away the whole Earth with all of the oceans, there is no way that one can see the “I” by doing that. The way that I have seen that “I” – one has to see the “I” in exactly that way. There is no second path.
