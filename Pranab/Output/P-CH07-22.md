### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
That [desirous] one goes on worshipping the form of that god with that kind of faith. Afterwards, that person attains all of the fruits of the desires, which are actually decreed by Me.

### Commentary 
 --- 
The faith that the Lord bestows on desirous beings according to their perceptions of otherness – those beings become concentrated via that faith, and thereby engage in the worship of the form of the particular god [associated with the particular desire]. It is true that after the worship the desired (wished for) fruits are attained; however, those fruits are actually bestowed by the Supreme Lord Himself – meaning: it is actually the Supreme Lord (their true “I”) that fulfills their desires [and not the perceived other god]. Thus, it is only He Who is bestowing the fruits of desires. Being bereft of knowledge, the desirous ones cannot perceive that the One Wondrous Supreme Lord is the One Who fulfills their desires. Because of this erroneous perception, those desired fruits that they receive are temporary. (See the next sloka.)
