śhreyān dravya-mayād yajñāj jñāna-yajñaḥ parantapa
sarvaṁ karmākhilaṁ pārtha jñāne parisamāpyate

### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
O Parantapa [Arjuna]! gyana-yagya is superior to dravya-yagya [see first line of commentary below]. O Partha [Arjuna]! All types of karmas [rites] end in gyana.

### Commentary 
 --- 
See the commentary to sloka 28 [of this Chapter 4] for the meanings of “dravya-yagya” and “gyana-yagya.” From that it can be seen that all types of karmas [rites; acts] become less and less [in density] and are finally transformed to gyana [knowledge; knowingness]. gyana is indeed the completion of karma [rites; acts]. When gyana dawns, one is freed of all karma [actions and their fruits]. It is for this reason that gyana-yagya is greater than dravya-yagya.
