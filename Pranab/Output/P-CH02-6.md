### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
If we are victorious, or if they are victorious over us – which among these two [possibilities] is more weighty for us? I cannot understand even this! Those – killing whom I do not even want to live – those same persons of the side of Dhritarasthra are in front of me.

### Commentary 
 --- 
After thinking like that [in the previous sloka], [the sadhak is] again thinking: “Oh right! Wait. Which one is good? Is it better to remain under the power of Prakriti, or is it better to bring Prakriti under one's power? By remaining under the power of Prakriti, the seed of samsara does not get destroyed. And then again, worldly enjoyments do not remain if one brings Prakriti under one's power. Those with whom I would enjoy the things of the world – killing whom there is no purpose for living – because of that I have no wish to live – all of those mental vrittis are here in front of me. That is what it is! What do I do!”
