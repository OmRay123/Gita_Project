### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
All actions are being done in every way by Prakriti alone, and the Self is the Non-doer. The one who sees this – that is the one who is the seer of Truth.

### Commentary 
 --- 
Just like little girls playing with their household-dolls in their playrooms are starting to learn the preparation for future enjoyments – in the same way, the first practice for the one who removes that self-killing Maya (that which destroys oneself), in order to reestablish oneself in the Form of the Self, is this enjoyable talk (that which teaches this and allows one to learn). The tri-guna-endowed Prakriti is the Maya [appearing play] of the Lord. Through actions and causalities, this Maya Herself shows Her limitation. Thus, doing and non-doing – She is the master of both of these. That is why the name is “Prakriti” [pro-doing]. Whatever associations of whatever kinds of actions, causalities and doership that may come – all of that verily is this enjoyment-loving Prakriti. “I” – that Infinite Light – am separate and nothing actually [connected to the play] – this direct knowledge is that which shows Oneself to be the Non-doer. The one who has attained this vision through special sadhana [spiritual practice] – that one is seeing Oneself as the Non-doer.
