### Bengali Translation 
 --- 
For the spiritually knowing yogi, because he/she sees that all of the sense-organs are carrying out their particular actions by themselves, even if that yogi does actions – such as seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, lying down (sleeping), letting go of the breath and drawing the breath, speaking words, eliminating, holding and the opening and closing of the eyes etc. - that yogi does not ever think that “I am doing something.”

### Commentary 
 --- 
The one who has known Truth, and is always enjoined to the State of the Self – because that being's chitta is completely pure, he/she never again has to become deluded in the “me and mine” of the Mayic creation. Thus, as the prarabdha experience plays out, all of the matters of the senses that take place such as seeing, hearing etc. - that sadhak has no sense of doership in that. The good and bad fruits of karmas that have to get carried out because of prarabdha happen only to the body. They cannot shake that sadhak's state of Profound Peace. Seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating – these are the activities of the five sense-organs of perception. Speaking, holding, moving, elimination of feces and urine – these are the activities of the five organs of action. Exhaling, inhaling, looking, closing one's eyes – these are the activities of the five pranas. Lying down (sleeping) is the activity of intellect in the inner senses.
